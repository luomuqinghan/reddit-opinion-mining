'Off topic, but how are you supposed to react/respond when a colleague is getting married and he is blatantly accepting dowry?'
'Leading Newspaper of our country reporting like this. Makes me real sad.'
'Am I only one who finds it weird that she was getting married at 22. Like wtf.\n\nNot to add, they were asking for fucking dowry.'
"I'm actually happy for that girl. Hope she gets some sense! "
'Unfortunately, dowry in marriage is like giving bribes to government employees, it is an accepted norm'
'By asking "Party kab dega?"'
'If the brides parents are giving it voluntarily then  you should mind your own business.'
'By taking a lead from the friend and demanding dowry yourself ...in 2000 rs notes. /s'
'>Off topic, but how are you supposed to react/respond when a colleague is getting married and he is blatantly accepting dowry?\n\n1. Gather proof\n2. Blackmail him and ask for a cut\n3. ???\n4. Profit'
'It is not like no one was ready to marry her. \n\nWhy people pay 1 crore dowry to IAS officers? They know he will earn and provide good lifestyle. Do you think, Officers like khemka would fetch 1 crore dowry price in market? why not?\n'
'Leading newspaper? This is the same paper that actually printed a story on Pamela Anderson saying that she likes anal sex the most. That was more than a decade back. '
'Agreed Westeros is way better.'
"> Why do people shorten their careers so?\n\nJudging by the article, they are pretty rich. Women from rich families are usually not part of the work force. IIRC, something like 70-80% of women who hail from rich families don't work. One of the reasons why Jain women are rarely a part of the work force. The same can be said for Gujurati traders(someone else can chime in if I am wrong)."
"What made you think she even had a career? Its not a joke or something but most girls don't - it's a very sad truth"
"Haven't you heard? Getting married was her dream job."
"Quite the feminist you are. In a patriarchal society where men have a lot more power than women, yes, girls do need to be saved until they're in a position to be empowered and get on their own feet. Of course this doesn't apply to all situations but I'll make an educated guess that it speaks for the majority."
"A better headline would indeed be 'Demonetisation causes wedding to fall through'. But that has more to do with grammar rather than progressiveness. \n\nIn your headline Demonetisation is the subject, whereas in the headline which says saves the girl, the subject is shifted towards dowry system as opposed. Actually the headline would be dependant on what you're trying to report. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say, is that what is a bigger news? Demonetisation causing a wedding to not happen, or Wedding getting cancelled because dowry wasn't paid on time? "
"You're right lot of people agree that dowry will mean bride's rights over father's property ends, if thats the agreement then fine. \n\nBut the boys side called off the wedding that must indicate that something wrong is going on. \n"
"But why? Guess who has a new car and doesn't know how to drive? Guess who like to drive new cars?\n\nHint: they are not the same person."
'Although it\'s acceptable to marry a rich woman (for her money) but without explicitly dealing with "dowry". '
'Yea... i guess congratulating and moving on is the better thing to do.'
"http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/dowry-major-cause-of-poor-sex-ratio/242746.html                 \n                                \n                   \nAs for inheritance, I think in Indian society, it is assumed that marriage implies a transfer of the female from one family to the other. She even takes their bloody name. So, you could force people to give equal shares to the girl child, but it'll be negated in individual cases by the girl's husband losing out on his inheritance to his own sisters. What you'd get then, is a fractured system of inheritances, which would help neither party but fuck up a load of family held businesses/agricultural lands through feuds and court cases. On an individual basis, it might be the case that the female loses more money to her brothers getting ancestral inheritance than her husband gets from his sister not getting ancestral inheritance, but on the macro scale it'll even out. And since divorce means effective division of property, the wife does get a share in her husband's property even if it isn't in her name. "
">If girls' parent give the girl child her fair share of paternal property, there would be no need of dowry. Just saying. Blame selfish parents of girl child. They don't want to give share to the female child, who will not take care of them when they get old.\n\nYou are right about that. All this dowry thing is prevalent because people don't treat their girl and boy child equally. It is because the girl child leaves you when she is married and the boy gets a wife who comes and serves you in your old days. Some ways to solve this problem:\n\n1) Equal rights for girls and boys in paternal property. This should be by default and the girl would have to explicitly take an undertaking if she wants none of her paternal property. Right now I think if they do not claim, everyone is fine. Most often unless they hate their brothers they don't claim because 'society'.\n\n2) Educate your girl child. If your daughter is educated and holds a job she is not dependent on anyone to provide for her. You don't need to find a groom for her. Allow her to find a groom if she desires or take her wish into consideration if she is fine with you picking one for her. There is a very good chance that prospective brides and their family would not demand or demand less dowry just because this woman is going to be a source of income for the family. It will be out of pure greed and yet solve the problem.\n\n3) And most important. Somehow if it was possible for people to move away from their parents after marriage. But this is a huge issue. One thing better about our culture is that old people are not left to fend for themselves or sent to old age homes. Even if you think sending to old age homes is fine, there is the problem of money. We are a poor country, we can't afford that. The logistics of it is very messy."
">  If dowry givers took a strong stance against it, the problem wouldn't exist today.\n\nbrother you live in communist utopia. if that was possible, workers of the world would have united together, and communism would have taken over the world."
"This cartoon was surprising. I mean it's the first time I'm seeing something like this in a national newspaper in this Modi era"
'Wonderful cartoon.\n\nQuite true but may be Manmohan sleeping would have been a more accurate description.'
'I think something people forget about when they talk about economics in India is the difference between geographic regions of India. I personally prefer to compare India to something more fluid like the European Union, rather than something more united like America.\n\nGujarat and Tamil Nadu are undoubtedly two of the most successful states in India (Pubjab just has a lot of farms), and South India is far more developed than most of North India; Maharashtra is an anomaly caused by British imperialism.\n\nMuslims are generally more economically backwards than Hindus, with Pakistan and Bangladesh being two of the most economically undeveloped countries on earth, fairing worse than much of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is one of the most economically and demographically successful Indian places, often outdoing South India in terms of progressive statistics.\n\nAlso, cities in southern India are generally more developed than cities in northern India, except for New Delhi and Mumbai; I doubt anyone here would say that a North Indian city beats Bengaluru or Chennai.\n\nI suggest that India makes sure it invests in infrastructure in order to spur economic growth; Bengaluru needs that tax money reinvested into its city rather than have it spent on rural communities, the [mag-lev] high speed rail needs to connect more cities, farmers and rural folk need to be taught how to navigate the commercial market properly (and may need somewhere to seek scientific/technical advise from) , etc...'

'> Aadhar, was setup during Congress rule?\n\nTrue. But setting it mandatory for many things was done by current Govt. \n\n> The same is true of Make in India. It was originally called the NMP(National Manufacturing Policy) and launched in 2011. Make in India is just a rebrand. So far I don\'t see it as more successful as its predecessor\n\nCould be true. But mere saying it that it was created by Congress doesn\'t give them credit, execution is more important. But yeah. So far there is nothing significant achieved in make in india. \n\n> GST was originally proposed by Congress but the BJP blocked it. \n\nTrue. But in case you didn\'t noticed, Congress also blocked recently passed GST, It was BJP govt which convinced all state parties to pass it. Like it or not GST credit goes to current govt irrespective of fact that Congress firstly proposed it. \n\n> Most of the "reforms" of this government are just ideas that Congress pushed but were stalled by either the BJP or coalition partners.\n\nTrue. But Popping up ideas is the easy part but execution is more important. Yes. Their ideas were stalled by BJP and other state parties but it was Congress\' Job to clear those ideas by convincing or threatening state parties which they didn\'t do it. At least BJP did that in case of GST.'
'> GST was originally proposed by Congress but the BJP blocked it.\n\nPlease stop this lie.Was the GST supported by the States?Even some Congress states were against it.\n\nand is the GST Bill completely unchanged from the Congress one?\n\nAnd about the Aadhar one,yeah the Congress invented it but then why didn\'t they use it to increase transparency of direct subsidies,or used it to improve efficiency of various schemes?Why didn\'t they try to increase transparency of Government tenders and contracts,in various aspects?\n\nStuff like this is what make me sceptical of the Congress supporters.It only goes to show that the so-called "best marketing" by a political party is actually the same as the other side,just is more in vogue now.\n\nedit:downvote all you want,lies and circlejerking won\'t become the truth'

Just saying even the slightest of action whether positive or negative is better than no action. This move may be 100% wrong, but it will spur the country into action and the next guy that comes in will take corrective measures. Black money may not be eradicated but it has shook up the entire country and from *\'chalta hai\'* attitude we will now have the *\'thoda kam chalta hai\'* attitude. \n\nIf a shopkeeper earlier did 75% of his billing in black, he will now do only 40-50% in black. If a businessman earlier declared only 30% of his income, he will now start declaring 50-60% of his income for fear of what may come next. \n\nTwo isolated examples but both true stories. Criticise the sentence *"at least he tried"* as much as you want, but fact of the matter is as the PM it is his duty to try. MMS did not and we curse him for that. Indira did try and we curse her for that. Nehru did try in his own sweet way , we curse him for that. AB Vajpayee has his own fair share of detractors. \n\nWhat do you want, a PM should simply review movies and blame the Secretary of UN for all problems in the country or use the tools at hand and use them in the best possible manner to attempt reforming the country. Hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nAnyhow criticising is very very easy, takes no effort. After all you are the guru on how to manage a country of 130 crore and the best economist there ever was and yours is the only opinion that matters.

">The RBI note, he said, “outlined potential costs and benefits of demonetisation, as well as alternatives that could achieve similar aims. If the government, on weighing the pros and cons, still decided to go ahead with demonetisation, the note outlined the preparation that would be needed, and the time that preparation would take.”\n\nAs the details come out it is getting increasingly clearer why it failed so drastically and why was the government not prepared to deal with it. They(the government) didn't wanna listen to the experts, got swayed by a mechanical engineer with no background in economics, then totally ignored the preparation RBI had outlined, thought it would be a brilliant idea. Surprise surprise? It was not. \n\nWith all this, I can't help but think it was done solely for the political gains. There is very little doubt now that someone, anyone in the leadership had good intentions with this."
"> “At no point during my term was the RBI asked to make a decision on demonetisation,” Rajan has said, putting to rest speculation that preparations for scrapping high-value banknotes got underway many months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the surprise announcement on November 8.\n\nThat is contrary to the statement by the Secretary and Urjit Patel before the Parliamentary Committee. I wonder if the opposition will haul them up for breach of privilege. Given the state of the opposition, I think they won't even realize the opportunity Rajan has given them."
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Raghuram Rajan breaks silence, says he wasn’t on board for demonetisation** \n\n ______ \nFormer RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has revealed that he did not favour demonetisation as he felt the short term economic costs associated with such a disruptive decision would outweigh any longer term benefits from it.\n\nRajan makes the disclosure in his latest book -- I do what I do – which is a compilation of speeches he delivered on wide range of issues as the RBI governor. Although he maintains the book is not a tell-all, the short introductions and postscripts accompanying the pieces offer fascinating insights into his uneasy relationship and differences with the present government.\n\n“At no point during my term was the RBI asked to make a decision on demonetisation,” Rajan has said, putting to rest speculation that preparations for scrapping high-value banknotes got underway many months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the surprise announcement on November 8.\n\nThis is the first time the former RBI governor has spoken on demonetisation since demitting office on September 3 last year. Rajan, who now teaches economics at University of Chicago, said he chose not to speak on India for a year because he didn’t want to “intrude on his successor’s initial engagement with the public”.\n\n“I was asked by the government in February 2016 for my view on demonetisation, which I gave orally. Although there might be long-term benefits, I felt the likely shot-term economic costs would outweigh them,” Rajan wrote.\n\n“I made these views known in no uncertain terms.”\n\nHe didn’t elaborate on the short-term costs or the possible long-term benefits, but as the RBI governor he “felt there were alternatives to achieve the main goals.”\n\nLatest government data showed the November 8 decision to scrap Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, sucking out 86% of cash circulating in the system, has had a lingering impact on the economy.\n\nThe growth of GDP slowed sharply from 7% in October-December quarter to 6.1% in January-March and 5.7% in April-June, primarily because of the cash squeeze that weakened consumer spending and discouraged businesses from making new investments.\n\nAccording to Rajan, despite his reservations, he was asked to prepare a note, which the RBI did and handed to the government, which then set up a committee to consider the issue.\n\nThe central bank was represented on the committee by its deputy governor in charge of currency, Rajan wrote, possibly implying he did not attend these meetings.\n\nThe RBI note, he said, “outlined potential costs and benefits of demonetisation, as well as alternatives that could achieve similar aims. If the government, on weighing the pros and cons, still decided to go ahead with demonetisation, the note outlined the preparation that would be needed, and the time that preparation would take.”\n\n“The RBI flagged what would happen if preparation was inadequate,” he wrote.\n\nThe current leadership of the central bank could not be reached for comments on Rajan’s acount. Phone calls to the RBI spokesperson went unanswered.\n\nRajan did not detail the contents of the note RBI had submitted to the government. Modi’s radical move was slammed by the opposition as ill-conceived and poorly executed. It took banks much longer than the government had expected to tide over the cash crisis. Frequent changes in cash withdrawal rules added to chaos and inconvenience that lasted far longer than the 50 days the PM had sought to restore normalcy.\n\nStill, Modi won popular support for his move, winning a landslide victory in crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh. Most people, especially the poor, backed his decision as a frontal attack on black money. But RBI data, available now, shows 99% of the Rs 15.46 lakh crore worth high value notes have returned to the banking system, meaning hoarders of black money found a way to legitimise most of their dodgy cash.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'>“The fact that 99% has been deposited certainly does suggest that aim (of curbing black money) has not been met,” Rajan said in the interview.\n\nThis sums up everything. The current government has succeeded in converting black money of corrupts to white money. And in the process has damaged the economy with this disruptive policy. There is no data available of how much of it was black money. For an honest taxpayer there are no incentives just more taxes. '
"Didn't the government lie to the supreme court saying DeMo was being planned with Rajan? They definitely lied in public, claiming that RBI began its preparations for DeMo under Rajan. Remember the contortions to explain why all the pink notes bore signatures of Arjit Patel, when they claimed that the notes were really printed under Rajan."

"I prefer calling it Modinomics. The use of the word Modinomics was widespread as late as 2015 to describe Modi's economic policies that would rescue India from the socialist, policy paralysis regime of the Congress. There was even a book on Modinomics. \n\nBut as the Modi slowdown began, GDP rates started falling, job creation became stagnant and then the masterstroke of demonetization crippled Indian economy, the word Modinomics fell out of favour and is rarely being used now. The slowdown is being blamed on everyone except the government, from Muslims to RBI governor to the banks. But we shouldn't stop using the word that brought us to the mess we're in. "
"Dude, don't be a bigot. There is no inherent reason for distrusting/dissing anyone because they have sold tea in the past. Infact that's one of those things that I respect Modi for. \n\nThe anti-expert sentiment is the one that we should be intolerable towards. The world is a complicated place, it is not possible for a single person to be adequately knowledgeable about everything- that's why the people in power should listen to the experts who have dedicated a large portion oftheir lives to get good at something.\n\nSo modinomics is fine by me as a term to remind ourselves what anti-expert sentiment can do."

"It's made me move towards more cash transactions. I max out my ATM withdrawals every month and pay everywhere using currency notes. Vendors offer discounts when they realise they won't be paying for credit card transaction fees. In addition, many shops that I visit regularly know that I won't even ask for a bill if they discount the tax component.\n\nExcept at government services. LPG bookings, petrol bunks, taxes, public transport bookings, etc. are all paid through my most expensive credit cards. I get great reward points at tax-payer expense. Last month I got a new microwave in exchange of my reward points. I should write a public letter to all tax-payers to thank them for the free appliance."

Modi is power hungry and most importantly he wants his name to go down in Indian history as one of the greatest prime ministers. And money can't do that alone.  He will have to perform for that.  I think his plans are made with the heart in the right place. The execution has been far from perfect.

"Totally agree with you. Thats why I have shifted my money to crypto-currencies. Thats the future.

And most importantly, it's deflationary, not inflationary, which means it's value rises with time. Suffice it to say, the money I converted to crypto is worth a lot more now than when I converted it.  It's legal, its audit-able and when ever the IT dept. figures out the regulations, i'll simply declare and pay whatever taxes they want. I'll still be on top. "

"I am just trying to be constructive and write this with only good intent. \n\nIt is ok to criticise the decision makers and persons of public interest. It might even be tolerable to ridicule them in a satire to a certain extent. But ridiculing the followers of something/somebody will only stop the discussion, polarise the society more. I think it is neither wise not acceptable. We saw that in the US election. We see it often in UK election (silent tory). You suppress the opinion of a faction so much, that they are crowded out and you turn your surroundings in an echo chamber. And in the end neither you nor the opposition has ressources/surroundings to have a really constructive approach to discussion and better our opinions. I would like to urge those, who believe in democracy (and not in oligarchy), to please try and remain courteous and engage in meaningful discussion even to people having the opposite opinion than yours. \n\nYes, I also had my moments where I thought of supporter of my opposition being paid writers. Against Bernie Sanders, we even had proofs that there was millions of dollars spent in online trolling/brigading against the Berners. But still the strategy of the Berners was, that sinking to their level dosn't do any good in anycase. If the others are truly paid agents, they are winning by distracting you from the meaningful discussion. If they are honest netizens with their own point of view, you are killing the meaningful discussion.\n\nSo please, if you are really interested in having a sane society and discussion culture, stop with all that cheap insults, trolling etc when discussing something seriously. \n\nI've been called Bhakts, Kulcha-Warrior and what not just for voicing my true and honest opinion. The name calling didnot at all change my point of view. May be others were prevented from taking me seriously, but just as many others were probably also prevented voicing their opinion similar to mine. The instances my opinion changed, was when someone was seriously, honestly and respectably in conversation with me.\n\nAlso, I asked myself a lot and I am also throwing this question in this thread because I could not solve it yet:\nHow do you really find out, who is brainwashed and who is not? How do you distinguish between propaganda and real news? Because people nowadays use thess word against their opposition quite a lot.\n\nI truly hope the society does not polarise the way they seem on reddit. I'm trying to play my part to stop this madness.\n\nTo the subject of this thread: I truly believe, that one can not really grasp any positives or negatives of demonetization so soon. The scheme isn't even over yet. If you really want to cement your opinion based on Modi's monetization policy, you atleast need to wait a year before cementing you opinion. Also there is no hurry because the reelection of PM is not around the corner.\n"

"> First is the limit of only 5000 INR till the end of the year for deposit.

'Genuinely curious. I have seen this "moving out" frequent here. Does it really come in action? Or is it new "oh my god", just to type?'
'There are many ways to move out, but moving out to an English speaking nation is not very easy.\n\nThe easiest English speaking nation to immigrate to is Canada but that too only if you are going the masters route. Even though it\'s the easiest way to immigrate, it still isn\'t very easy and will require spending 4-5 years struggling for it.\n\nEasiest non-English-speaking and still relatively well off country would be Brazil in my opinion. They are actively looking for immigrants for some reason and there are many ways to get in there. I\'m keeping this as the last resort, in case I fail to get into Canada (even though I might not fail because things are looking organized and well planned for me).\n\nYes, it\'s not as good as some of the English speaking countries where people usually immigrate to, but Brazil is miles ahead of India when it comes to average happiness Index. Their official slogan should be "Pop ~~and~~ *a beer and chill". Pretty chilled out nation. Also, I love watching soccer.\n\nAlways have a backup plan for big career decisions(Brazil, in my case) . Am not even marrying until I\'m out of India because you cannot sign a prenup in India and one divorce and my career will get fucked because of fucking alimony. Am gonna be young only for a few years, can\'t fucking risk with getting in a financial mess in those precious 4-5 years that I got.\n\nFor canada there are basically two ways, first is CEC (Canadian Experience Class). It is basically the easiest way. You have to go in as a student, study there for some time and you will be given the same amount of time to find a job as the time it took to get you a degree (i.e you can legally be inside for that period of time). If you get a job then you can apply for Permanent Residence and if you get PR, then it becomes very easy to become a citizen, but getting PR will depend on a lot of factors.\n\nI don\'t remember the name of the second programme to get into Canada (because I\'m not aiming for it), but it is when you already have some skills which the country is actively looking for, then you can apply via this program and based on your profile you will be awarded some points and based on those points they will decide whether you can qualify for that programme or not, if you do qualify, then you have to find a job in Canada, and stay there for I guess two years (not sure about this) before you can apply for PR. Once you get PR, it\'s comparatively easier to become a canadian citizen.\n\nThere is a third way for Canada as well, I guess it is something to do with provincial sponsorship programme. Particular provinces are looking for some specific skills and if you meet them then you can apply via their respective programme. They expect you to stay in that province for a few years after immigration though, which in my opinion is worth it. Anywhere in Canada is better than India to be honest.\n\nNot sure about AUS and ENG, but being commonwealth countries have some advantages, but I don\'t know how easy or difficult is to get in these nations. I cannot provide any information because of particular reasons I am not targeting these countries.\n\nFor USA. Boy, is it a mess? The thing is that US wants to maintain the cultural diversity of the nation, but does not want too many from the same nation to immigrate in the country as that will cause imbalance in the cultural diversity towards one particular ethnicity. Therefore, they limit their entry only to some limited numbers per nation. The problem here now is that the amount of people who apply for their Green cards is huge from India and China because overpopulation, and since US can accept only a few people from one Ethnicity, therefore it becomes very difficult for Indian and Chinese people to immigrate. If you apply now then you would be a part of the ever increasing queue of applicants, so it might be years before you become the citizen of USA, and even after waiting it might get rejected and you might never become a citizen, so USA is really very difficult. Also the different types of Visa mess is actually a thing. You could be stuck in those forever, which is why I ticked USA out of my list.\n\nCanada made the most sense for me to be honest. I\'ve got a great job currently in India which pays me in 7 figures annually (Rupees of course), so I might save some money and do my masters when it\'s time. I\'m pretty young (20) so that helps. Things might be different for you.\n\nDo some research and find out whatever way works the best for you.\n\nEdit : One advice above all. Develop some insane skills, because to be very honest, it makes things much easier. Either have insane skills, or be extremely rich. Think from the perspective of the country taking you in. If you don\'t have either, then you are just another person who will take over country\'s resources, and they have no reason to take you in. The only reason they are taking you in is if you can provide them with valuable skills or invest some money in their country. Yes, you are going there to contribute to their country over yours, and you have to accept that you are being selfish and as some people might call "anti-national". You just have to be aware of these things and be practical about them.\n\n**TLDR : Brazil, Canada easier to immigrate, Don\'t know about AUS and UK; USA immigration is a mess, but worth it if you can do the hard-work required(if you can do the needful, lol (\\^_\\^) )** '

'demonetisation: Petrol pumps won\'t accept cards from Monday to protest bank\'s transaction fee\n\n---\n\n>* BENGALURU: Petrol pumps across India will stop accepting debit and credit cards from Monday to protest what the petroleum dealers call an "irrational and sudden" move by banks to charge 1% transaction fee on every payment accepted by card.The banks\' move will not target the citizens directly as no new charges will be levied on customers using cards.But if petrol stations continue with cash-only operations, it will certainly inconvenience lakhs of vehicle owners given the paucity of cash in the system.The non-acceptance of credit/debit cards at petrol stations comes at a time when the Centre is pushing for increased non-cash transactions, and close on the heels of its announcement of a 0.75% cashback offer on purchase of petrol using cards.Speaking to TOI, BR Ravindranath, president, Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders and Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said: "They (banks) must apologise to the public.\n\n>* Sale of petrol/diesel is highly regulated and we cannot fix our own rates in view of this sudden levy by banks.\n\n>* "On whether punishing people is the right attitude, Ravindranath said: "We do not have control over how much profit is fixed for us, or at how much we can sell petrol at.\n\n>* When we contacted George Paul (the person co-ordinating on behalf of OMCs), he says it is between us and the banks and that we should sort it out.\n\n>* "Stating that the decision has been taken unanimously by all petroleum dealers in the country, Ravindranath said there is no question on going back on this.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n> * [demonetisation: Petrol pumps won\'t accept cards from Monday to protest bank\'s transaction fee](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/petrol-stations-to-not-accept-cards-from-monday-in-protest-over-banks-transaction-fee/articleshow/56402253.cms)\n\n> * [Demonetisation: Petrol pumps, airports won’t accept Rs 500 notes from Dec 3](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-sat-no-old-notes-for-fuel-toll-collection-to-resume-using-cards-fastags/story-Bv26jtOjMGbcCHCqQdDzXL.html)\n\n> * [No old notes for fuel from Saturday, toll collection to resume](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584143/old-rs-500-notes-valid.html)\n\n---\n\n^I\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^"delete" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme'
'They will continue to accept it till 13th Jan'
'us there any transaction fee free service? UPI? '
'cash predominates in shitty third world countries precisely because it is cheaper than alternate payment methods. even grocery shops operate on a 10% markup at most. if they had to pay even 1% of that as transaction cost for a payment method then they would refuse to accept that payment method. real world cc processing fees are like 2-3% at least.\n\nin first world countries the markup on cost is something like 50-100% so they can afford digital payments.\n\nbitcoin might change this whole equation if it ever gets mainstream acceptance and stabilizes in value.'
'>  “But we cannot afford to pay from our margin. We want our profit margin (of 2 per cent) intact,” \n\nI seriously do not believe petrol bunks operate at 2% margin unless one include the bribes paid to acquire a license.

'<1% profit? Why do owners still continue to run petrol pumps?'
'Since when he has given takes on anything we care about? '
'I understand that it is a loss but before demonetisation most petrol pumps in the cities accepted card payments. We are basically going back to the same conditions as before. \nSo what has changed now that they can no longer bear what is basically the cost of doing business.\n\nWhile I agree that the 1% charge should be waived off or reduced by the government, its more applicable to small merchants and those who have suddenly been affected by it.\n\nThis seems like a ploy by petrol pump owners to earn more profits than before.'
"The (earlier) govt. had done the right thing by starting RuPay to introduce competition in this space. The 1-2% charge made by banks on card transactions is exorbitant. Introducing competition such as RuPay was supposed to fix it, but somehow free market economics isn't working in this space.\n\nSteps should be taken to ensure that competition from RuPay drives down transaction costs. Firstly an investigation should be done as to why RuPay hasn't forced the transaction costs down. "

"Previously, at pumps the merchants weren't charged a transaction fee (an exception to the rule). Consumers were charged a surcharge for transactions at pumps, which sometimes was waived off on premium cards. On Saturday a few Banks that provide PoS machines suddenly and with few hours notice told that they will charge Pumps (i.e. the Merchants) a 1% charge. This was unacceptable to the pumps because their profit margin was less than 1%."
"> In America they have a cash price and a credit price which is a few cents more to offset the credit card fees on gas. It's an easy solution for any country to adapt.\n\nHave they sucked cash out the system and forced people to move alternate means of payment in america?"

'Money is credit record. Right now the government is spending money through RBI by printing these records and supplying it to the economy.

"This is a genuine concern for the small time shopkeepers. The government should probably have some kind of two tier structure allowing for some of these costs to be offset against the small traders' taxes.\n\nUnfortunately for them, people like me tend to go over to the large retailers like Dmart/Reliance for the convenience. I find the regular hassle over change and small denominations just not worth it."
'We own a retail showroom and we have same issue.\n\nOur margin on the product we sell is 3%, credit card fees are almost 1.9% with taxes.\n\nThis means, if our product cost is 50,000 INR, we get 1,500 INR out of which 950 will go to credit card company. That is not a sustainable model.\n\nThere needs to be a model where you are charged a certain % up to a max amount based on cost.\n\nE.g., for below 100 Rs, you are charged 2%.\n100-500, 2% up to 5 Rs.\n\nAnd banks charging money for transactions should be banned.'

So if the government is any serious about 'digital' India, it should undo any sort of electronic transaction fee so that more and more people adopt them over paper currency."

"There are 2 things which can be done to facilitate more CC transactions   \n\n- Allow shopkeepers to charge a credit card surcharge.

This way, we are helping the country by making sure our transaction is accounted for. If all of us showed a little desh prem and welcomed paying a credit card surcharge, then credit card acceptance would be more widespread.   \n\n- Abolish MRP. This allows shopkeepers to build up the transaction costs into the selling price.  \n\nI prefer the first method - because it means that as a cash user, I don't have to subsidise the CC users."

"> There needs to be a model where you are charged a certain % up to a max amount based on cost.\n\nHow can that be possible at all? Credit Card transactions are automated bill discounting. \n\nThis is what is bill discounting. Let's say my company orders 2 lakhs rupees worth of stuff from a vendor. Our company payment terms are that we pay 1 month after the delivery. Now the vendor cannot wait for 1 month. So he takes the bill to a bank & the bank pays him the money immediately and collects the money from my company after 1 month. This is called bill discounting. The Bank doesn't pay him 2 lakhs. It discounts the bill & pays him 1,96,000 & collects 2 lakhs from my company after 1 month. So what the bank has done is given him a loan of 2 lakhs for 1 month & charged him 2% monthly interest on it. \n\nA credit card transaction is exactly this. Someone buys something from your showroom & is telling you I will pay you after a month. You take his bill to the credit card company and get a loan of that amount right away & the credit card company collects from the card owner after a month. So the credit card company is giving you a loan and charging you interest on the loan - that interest is called your credit card fees. \n\nIs it possible for a bank to you give you a loan with a model where you are charged a certain %age upto a max cost? Not at all. Can you get a home loan for 1 crore from a bank where they charge you interest only for the first 10 lakhs and not beyond that? The money the bank is paying you for the credit card transaction is their money they are taking out of circulation. They are themselves paying money to someone for that money. So how can they only charge you interest upto a max amount and not for a fixed amount? "

'Yes. It\'s actually indirect. I\'ll give you an example.\n\nSuppose you own a house - off the books, and you have it on rent with the rent depositing to an account not connected to your PAN. Now you feel like you want to show that house rent as an income and pay the tax on it. And if you declare it as "income previously undeclared" and pay the corresponding fine, yes, it is true, there will be no scrutiny on the past rent income.\n\nBut that\'s where your immunity ends. All transactions over the last 5 years in that account go under the scanner - and you are bound to have transactions other than that one particular rent. The means you employed to afford that property in the first place are not immune - there can inquiries as to your mode of payment for the same. If you sold some other property at that time to invest into this one (and there would be a large portion of the transaction in cash), that too can and will be traced. Basically once they attach one irregularity to your PAN, they know you\'re a solid case. It\'s much easier to scrutinise your case properly than to trawl through hundreds of thousands of PAN cards of lower middle class people for a "maybe" case.'

This govt has vehemently opposed RTI on political parties, they\'ve watered down the whistleblower bill, they\'ve allowed witnesses to be killed vyapam style and they want political donations to be anonymous. Seriously, this is how black money will be fought, by making parties a great funnel for black money?'
"> 99% is bit on expected lines isn't it? \n\nthis is a straight up lie. the government said that around 30% of the money won't come back. but then they shifted the goal posts and it seems you have forgotten about it. please read up on the facts of what the government claimed before sucking up to their defence"
"nope. it could still be black money, money on which taxes have not been paid.\n\nfor example : you say you are low income, and either not file taxes or file it with low income. but you deposited 2 crore into your account during demonetization. the tax guys will come and ask where this money came from. \n\nas long as they don't have reply, this money is classified as black. it might not be, but it is so classified.\n\nyou may have legit reason for deposit. \n\nas of now, the government is going to HAVE to show/talk something positive, otherwise they cannot convince the sceptics, whose votes they might need in the future.\n\nit will be a mixed bag, and will take some time, say 2 years, to clear out Just in time for the next election, a miracle.\n\n:)"
"Few months before demonetization the government was running an income declaration scheme asking people to declare their ill-gotten wealth. Over 60k people declared it to the tune of 65k crores.

They would be shitting bricks wondering what to do with their wealth. Won't surprise me that lots of people would indeed deposit their money in the bank in the hope that the government will forgive their belated attempt on declaring their wealth.\n\nSure people would have used other options to convert their money (gold being another thing you can add to your list) but i feel the volume of money washed this way would be much less that what people make it out to be.\n\nI don't think the RBI will get itself into the game of catching people with black money. That will be tasked to the investigation agencies (ED, IT etc).\n\nI haven't read/heard anywhere of large scale black money used in political funding.

"> Over 60k people declared it to the tune of 65k crores. Pretty sure these people weren't foolish. \n\nApples and orangutans. The IDS exempted the declarers from legal action. Depositing money during DeMo didn't, in fact the stated goal was to catch people depositing money beyond their known sources of income. You'd have to be exceptionally thick to knowingly deposit unaccountable money into your own account. \n\n\n> They would be shitting bricks wondering what to do with their wealth.\n\nOr, you know, using any of the umpteen methods that were available. There were do many methods that even the media was reporting on, there were in all probability quite a few more that they weren't aware of too.\n\nIn the worst case, even if they couldn't use any of those avenues, they still had the option of destroying the cash. That would reduce their net worth but it would also avoid getting caught. You're asserting that they ignored all these obvious options and chose to show the govt that they had black money after the govt explicitly stated that black money holders would get punished. Just how thick do you think the black money holders are? \n\nAlso, if what you just said is true, think about the obvious implications: almost all the black money hoarders had faith that the govt would be lenient with them (which is why only 1% didn't come back) and that's why they deposited the money. Why would black money hoarders gave such complete faith in the govt's sympathy if the govt was so serious about ending black money?\n\n\n\n> but i feel the volume of money washed this way would be much less that what people make it out to be.\n\nDo you have any data to back up those feelings? I'm not sure how much I can trust your jedi instincts. \n\n\n> I haven't read/heard anywhere of large scale black money used in political funding\n\nYes, because political parties (who run the govt) have all the incentive in the world to reveal information about how much they are financed by black money. And they don't have the means to prevent you from finding out. After all, political funding worldwide is known as one of the most straightforward, least corrupt and susceptible to moral hazard activities possible. \n\nBut let's think through your assertion for a minute. You think this third world country has a massive problem of black money and corruption, but you think political funding, an area where unscrupulous businessmen (ie black money holders) can invest to further their own interests, is largely immune to the influx of black money? Seriously, black money hoarders would not see the obvious benefits of buying up political parties, something even legit businessmen in the first world see the value of doing, despite the fact that political connections are much more valuable to a black money hoarder? \n\nIf you're willing to believe that, then I think I've just seen the target audience for the Nigerian prince email scams.

'**Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme**\n\nThe Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) was a very unconventional but successful step among Indian economic policies. It would give an opportunity to the income tax or wealth tax defaulters to disclose their undisclosed income at the prevailing tax rates. This scheme would also ensure that the laws relating to economic offences would not be applicable for those defaulters. Over 350,000 people disclosed their income and assets under this scheme, which brought a revenue of ₹78 billion (US$1.2 billion) to the Indian finance ministry.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'

"Ok so between 1951 to 1997 60k crore was collected from VDIS and 65k crore in 2016 alone from IDS.

Quite a large number for sure and something that definitely should be reformed - but - in the context of this thread still quite a small figure to hold up to the assertion made earlier that large part of black money from demonetization drive was ending up in political funding. Looks like it's not. Maybe hundreds of crores but not ten's of thousands or lakhs of crores of rupees ending into political funding as it is made out to be."
"\n>Ok so between 1951 to 1997 60k crore was collected from VDIS and 65k crore in 2016 alone from IDS.\n\nReading comprehension failure? \n\nFrom the article:\n>One of them was the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme, 1997, which had been introduced for a compliance period of six months. Under VDIS,\xa0\xa0the tax payable on the declared amount was at the rate of 35 per cent in case of companies and firms, and 30 percent in the case of others.\xa0The income declared under VDIS had been\xa0Rs 33,000 crore.\xa0\n\n>Reports suggested that the fair value of the declarations under the scheme\xa0would have\xa0been over Rs 60,000 crore, rather than the Rs 33,000 crore that was actually declared. That\xa0scheme attracted 4.75 lakh declarations. Almost\xa03.09 lakh pertained to jewellery and other movable assets.\n\n\nPolitical funding: Yes, because political parties have all the incentive in the world to declare all their funding. The amount in the linked article is only that which is declared by them. There are many expenses and incomes which aren't even declared. Like the cash or other gifts given to voters."

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Demonetisation effect: 9.1 million new taxpayers** \n\n ______ \nA file photo of a queue at an ATM during demonetisation. A low taxpayer base has for long been a key drag on the government’s finances. Photo: PTI\n\nThe government added 9.1 million new taxpayers in 2016-17, an 80% increase over the typical yearly rise, highlighting the impact of India’s November demonetisation of high-value currencies.\n\nThis is expected to significantly boost the government’s tax revenue. India had only 55.9 million individual taxpayers at the end of 2015-16.\n\nThe Economic Times, citing two top government officials, reported on 3 May that the number of people who filed tax returns surged by 9.5 million.\n\nNot everyone who pays tax files returns. Many are salaried employees whose tax is deducted and paid by the employers. In 2015-16, only 37 million individuals filed tax returns.\n\nThe increase in taxpayers may be used by the government to justify demonetisation, which critics have claimed did not help in its original objective of curbing black money, terror financing or counterfeit notes.\n\n“About 9.1 million new taxpayers have been found, significantly expanding the taxpayer base,” a senior government functionary said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe person, who is in a position to be aware of data and thinking at the highest levels of the government, added that this was partly on account of demonetisation.\n\nIt is estimated that a substantial part of the invalidated currency has returned to the banking system—official data on this is yet to be released—but the government has insisted, and rightly so, that the mere act of depositing money in a bank account doesn’t convert black money into white money.\n\nA second person, a government official familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified, confirmed this number. He said that every year, typically, India adds around 6 million taxpayers, and around 1 million stop paying taxes (on account of death, retirement, etc). That would mean India added around 4.1 million more taxpayers in 2016-17 than it otherwise would have.\n\nThe second person said India ended the year with 65 million taxpayers. In June 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the income-tax department to work towards increasing India’s tax base to 100 million individuals.\n\nA low taxpayer base has for long been a key drag on the government’s finances. India’s tax revenue, including indirect taxes, as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.7% in 2016, compared with 25.4% in the US and 30.3% in Japan.\n\nAmong the 37 million individuals who filed tax returns in 2015-16, 9.9 million showed income below the exemption limit of Rs2.5 lakh; 19.5 million, income between Rs2.5 lakh and Rs5 lakh; 5.2 million, between Rs5 lakh and Rs10 lakh; and only 2.4 million people showed income over Rs10 lakh. Of the 7.6 million individual assesses who declared income above Rs5 lakh, 5.6 million were in the salaried class. Only 172,000 people declared income exceeding Rs50 lakh in the entire country.\n\nIn comparison, in the last five years, more than 12.5 million cars have been sold and, in 2015, 20 million Indians travelled overseas, either for business or pleasure.\n\nIn his budget speech on 1 February, finance minister Arun Jaitley quoted these figures and said India is largely a tax non-compliant society. “The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes,” he said.\n\nJaitley added in his speech that after demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presented a revealing picture. “During the period 8 November to 30 December 2016, deposits between Rs2 lakh and Rs80 lakh were made in about 10.9 million accounts with an average deposit size of Rs5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than Rs80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of Rs3.31 crore. This data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation,” he said then.\n\nThis year’s Economic Survey said that perhaps the most important marker of the success of demonetisation would be tax collections.\n\n“The number of new income tax payers as well as the magnitude of reported and taxable income should go up over time. That will be the surest sign of success.”\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, in its latest Asia Pacific Economic Outlook, said that after demonetisation, bank deposits of large amounts were expected to attract high scrutiny by tax authorities and the information obtained as a result of income verification could lead to a durable impact on the tax revenue base. “With only about 1% of the Indian population paying personal income taxes, the scope for broadening the tax base is clearly large,” it said.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
"Over the course of a normal year, about 5 million new tax payers are added. Now assuming all of the extra tax payers came from demonetization, 4 million more were added this year. So does that mean demonetization was a success? If you are to ignore all the cons and the initial goals of demonetization then maybe this increase is a minor success. Let's do another demonetization next year. "
'Hope they scrap 2k notes.'
"Too soon to pat themselves on the back. The true measure is how many of these taxpayers pay tax next year as well? We don't need spurts of tax payments. We need people to step forward and avoid tax evasion."
"> only 4 million\n\nIf each of these people pay just 1000 as tax , that is an additional 4 billion in tax revenue. And over the years, even if 50% keep paying, that's a lot of tax revenue that can be utilized by the govt.\n\n> these people can go back to reporting 1 lpa income for the next year.\n\nIt's not that simple. If they have reported a large amount this year, they cannot all suddenly report much smaller amounts next year. That would be easy to spot and will come under the scanner. "
">only 4 million\n\nSo we are still talking ~44% more people here. \n\nDo you not realise that that number in itself is huge and a 44% contribution to this is a very significant one? \n\n> the only reason they did so was because their unaccounted cash got accounted this time\n\nI'm failing to understand how you don't know that this was one of the aims of the whole thing. \n\nIt's better to leave your biases for once and maybe analyse something objectively based on the figures provided. Whether the figures are skewed or something is your view on it but there is still an increase. That's a fact. "

Go back six months and check my posts on how I defended demonetization then. \n\n>So we are still talking ~44% more people here.\n\n44% of what? By my estimate, it's around 10% of the total tax base. That's impressive. But you should again remember that this is a one time gain. People have already gone back to cash and until the government keeps invalidating currencies again and again (and take investor confidence to the dumpster), these people are not paying taxes again. \n\nThink about this. These 4 million people were tax evaders. Ideally, they must have been prosecuted. Or in a VDS, they must have paid a hefty penalty. But they did neither. Most of them just declared all their stashed wealth as this year's income and paid normal 30% tax on it. So many people stood in queues and some died for this?"
'> Do you not realise that that number in itself is huge and a 44% contribution to this is a very significant one? \n\nYou are assuming that the 4.1M tax payers have paid significant tax contributions.\n\nI\'ve mentioned this elsewhere in the thread too. First, this 4.1M number is based on "ET sources". Second, we do not know how much tax these 4.1M paid back into the system. Third, putting money into the bank account does not turn black money into white - like state by the article.\n\n'
'You mean the government will keep making currencies invalid again and again? Good way to boost business confidence. '
'yeah but the 80% increase has come directly as a result of demon right?? It sounded to me like you were saying the 80% more would have come in any case.. My mistake..  ?But thats almost doube the usual numbers and I am sure a person paying tax once would not start reporting 1 lakg per annum from next year.. IT Dept would track such instances.. \n\n'
"And what is the realistic capacity of cases the ITO can scrutinise for such a detailed audit? It's barely in the thousands, not in the millions. That's why they start from the big fish. So you might as well take a chance.\n\nI've been self-employed for a while now and have had years where my income has suddenly dropped from the 30% slab to non-taxable. I've never been served a notice."
'How will IT department track this? The only reason people had to come out was because the currency notes were made invalid. These people are now going to be more careful and have very little liquidity. They are going to buy gold in cash and stash it like they have always done. The IT department can scrutinize all they want, but how are they going to get any evidence of this cash if all of this is stashed somewhere safe and there is no trail of transaction?'
'No, the article clearly mentions that India added 4.1M more tax payers than it would add otherwise. '
"That's why the gau-vernment has an investigation agency plus the power to change the judicial system at its disposal. You know why we sacrifice our absolute freedom to the government? So that, they ensure investigations are done properly, fast and disposed off appropriately in court. Law and order is one of the main focus points of a democratic republic. \n\n"
'> hey have always done. The IT department can scrutinize all they want, but how are they going to get any evidence of this cash if all of this is stashed somewhere safe and there is no trail of transaction?\n\nWhat do you think push to digital is all about???  Stashing cash is now a big no as they are afraid of Another Demonitization sometime in future.. I feel this is a good affect of demonitization and we must take it as such..  Ofcourse the cons were also there and they should not be forgotten. '

" The article clearly mentions that depositing money into bank accounts doesn't turn black money into white. "
"Jewelers slap gov right on the face by creating multiple small bills instead of one big bill. Unless they made it mandatory for any transaction I don't see Pan card coming into picture here."
'Reporting losses is not evasion, its avoidance ; and its legally ok for a business to do that.'
'Agreed.. There is an inherent cost of Digital but remember there is nothing called a free lunch in this world.. Paper money has the printing cost, transport cost, security cost.. If all these cost are counted, 2-3 % cost of digital makes sense..  There is no mass  payment system which is 100% free .. wither you pay directly or through your taxes and ask government to print notes..   As for me, I would want anyone using money to bear this cost which is currently only being borne by tax payers and in the process if we can bring in more people under tax net (income tax as I know everyone pays taxes in some form), it will hopefully help us pay for things like better infra and education.   \n\n'
"Stashing your cash under your bed and then claiming zero revenue is evasion, not avoidance. And that's exactly what we are discussing here."
"We are a country where rats drink up 1 million liters of alcohol. All those claims you see from the IT department is part of their 'security theater'. I've been to their departments several times in the past and the guys struggle to open attachments from email. \n\nBut even assuming smart people get these things done, you are missing the point that all of this technology is only useful when there is a trail to a business transaction. If the government restricts gold and realty, people will shift to diamonds, copper or whatever standard unit there is to trade in black. There are a million ways to keep transactions without a trail. "
'Lets forget about the final actual number - assume that 4.1M is indeed the correct number for discussion. First, we are speculating on a number here based on "sources". Second, the exact number is 4.1M even based on the speculated number. Third, we do not know how much money these 4.1M bought into the system. Finally, just bringing in money doesn\'t convert it from black to white.\n\nI don\'t even know why a news article based on speculation with almost nothing to talk about is even worthy of discussion.'
'Not recently, no. Has anything changed?'
"> Paper money has the printing cost, transport cost, security cost.. \n\nTrue. And this is borne by the government today. I'd expect it is fair for the government to then bear the transaction costs with a technology like UPI. After all, this cost will be paid back over time with better trail and hopefully more taxes."

'As an outsider I will try to put logical reasoning here:\n1: She just takes out what is needed but still has about half a million in old notes, also she gets new notes from ATM (2k, 0.5k) but has no awareness as she does not speak to anyone (as if she can buy her stuff without saying a word)\n2: people offered to help her and SHE declined\n3: Article clearly says that although she was raided she will likely not get punished due to her age and IT dept will be informed for consideration.\n\nNow talking about legality, although one should not make exception about her in terms of application of law, clearly legal loophole related to mental heath can be used by  IT department to release her from her charges. '
'The move was fairly widely advertised. TV, radio, newspaper, online etc. Every possible mass communication method. Perhaps Modi should have personally gone and informed every single Indian.\n\nAlso, when laws are made and notifications issued, whether prospectively, retrospectively or retro actively, citizens are assumed to know and acquiesce to them. And a well established legal maxim is that "ignorance of law is not an excuse".\n\nCould the move have been handled better, definitely. But can you expect the government to ENSURE each person has the knowledge, fuck no.'

"So according to you this demonetisation drive has been going on for the last 60 years eh?\n\nIts an open secret that the BJP leaders across various states are getting caught with their 'loot' - and they're caught only because of the disgruntled 'insiders' who tip off their movements while going about taking their loot and distributing to their accomplices and thus making hay while the sun shines!\n\nAnd even after being caught they have the assurance of Clean Chit too!"
'Have you tried reporting to the Banking Ombudsman? Might be worth a shot'
'I have both hdfc and kotak. Both were really nice (been only two years, so cant say much). Kotak was better than hdfc in terms of communication when the demonetisation happened. '
"They got mammoth bonuses instead.\n\nSeriously though, there were investigations and long court trials. It's difficult to prosecute when there are so many loopholes and the entire framework of the law tends to protect people like this. The entire capitalist system is deeply flawed and the deregulation of the 90s, in fact the deregulation going back to the Reagan era led to this. Maybe someday things will get back on track and move away from completely laissez-faire capitalism."
"There are many many such services. I'll list the simplest of them.\n\n1) CIBIL - generates a score for a customer based on his / her credit worthiness (costs quite a bit per report). There is a serious amount of data that would come in from this.\n\n2) PAN - We all know PAN, there are tons of services around data related to PAN card etc. Look it up.\n\n3) Aadhaar :- This is like a goldmine for all general purpose data (especially the fact that they have biometric data is just amazing. Not sure if we can get any of that data though, as I didn't really work on the Aadhaar project at all.)\n\nThere is a hell lot more past this (and yes they are perfectly legal and under the gambit of RBI etc.) But as a few people on reddit know what company I work for, I don't think I can share any of them.\n\nPoint being, the only reason to try and get the black market data is because the normal market one is a bit harder  to get and usually more costlier. But then white is very much trustable, whereas gray sources aren't really.\n\nThese data can be used to generate profiles, limits and trends for customers (although, remember such data isn't cheap), so if the industry wants to do it, there are tons of services which get a lot of data like your bank balance and a lot more...."
'>Why is your comment restricted to BJP only? \n\nBecause \n\n- BJP is in power,\n- BJP has introduced this Demonetisation and \n- its the BJP leaders who are hand in glove in this loot now.\n\n>Coalgate, CWG, 2G, etc?\n\nNot relevant in this particular thread.\n\n>Worst part is, they are not even getting caught !!\n\nWhat is stopping BJP from having them get caught?'
'What do you think the consequences are for anyone who goes after the ruling party from the IT Dept? Who do you think is going to protect them? Prime Chestbeater?\n\nNitin Gadkari has a ton of black and white evidence against him for money laundering and a death under mysterious circumstances, and nothing is going to happen to him until the BJP leaves power. You randia chuts are probably not even aware of it now because his own party gave him a clean chit. Congress is the same.'

Hello taxpayers! Your money is about to be spent on ad agencies just to prove how shiny flawless Aadhaar is. [NP]
'Nothing shocking about this. Almost everyone knew this would happen'
'Whats surprising here? Everyone knows about the rampant nepotism and corruption in the armed forces.'
'I love my India. Vatan Mera india. \n\nThanks modiji. Never felt so safe in my life. \n\nThanks for arresting the people who bring the entire country down.'
'I break chain of command in my office HR gives me a call and he did this in army, an institution where second lesson is never betray your commanding officer first being country first. So what happened to him should not surprise anybody, as this would set a dangerous presedent for other soldiers. Have a grievance good post it on social media for the whole world to see. A world which comprises of people they protect us from'
"But isn't this army supposed to do ? I understand he has a point but going against the superiors in the media is asking for trouble."
"No surprise. This is what we expect from the system. Can't just blame the current government. It would have been no different under any other govt. Yes, some would have hoped the BJP would prove their nationalistic credentials as they try to everywhere else. Politicians without political will, all of them."
'LOL are you actually shocked this happened in that country. Ha!'
"that's why our india like this "
"That's Modi Sarkar for you. Supreme leader."
"okay okay don't bash me on this but there could be a chance he was payed by ISI to do this to demoralize the forces. That's the tricks countries play."
'What was he expecting? Bravery award?'
"We need some laws if we already don't have any to protect whistleblowers. "
'The Snowden is a different story, this is a basic human right of getting good quality food while another one is Govt. spying on a bunch of people on the internet and phones,  talking, chatting to another bunch of people.'
'> To be honest, this is exactly how most militaries in the world work.\n\nWe are aspiring to be a military superpower. We should compare ourselves to militaries of first world, not normalize what happens in other militaries.\n\n'
'🇮🇳We support Modi, We support Modi 🇮🇳\n'
"Do you mean to say this is not all Modi's fault? DOWNVOTE this guy and brand him as a Bhakt. One guy above said he is no longer feeling safe because of things like these that Modi does. Screw the rules of BSF/Army. Obligatory, Acche din sarcastic statement. \n\n"
'Looks like he did (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞'
"Downvote him all you want but u/IndianThrowawayID is partly right, when he says this is not the way one show grievances in the armed forces.\n\nArmed forces have a different structures/hierarchy and different type of trust than the civilian life.\n\nSoldiers have to put their lives on the line on their superior's command, without asking question, so what that means is a soldier can't question his superior's authority.\n\nSo what Tej Bahadur did was not wrong per se, but this is not the thing a soldier is supposed to do. Having said that what makes Tej Bahadur especially courageous in my eyes is that he did this knowing fully well that his career would be over after this, and for him to be doing this, the things must really be bad\n\n\n\n"

'Yes Twice.Because Desh ka Jawaan sirf Ek Goli se nahi Marta.Jai Hind!! -Mitron'
'please enlighten me, did the plight of our jawans become worse since past 2 years or was it like this previously and jawans have started showing their plight now?'
'Its the internet, ofcourse its true'
'Dear leader behaves like one man army and gets himself photo shopped for all activities, including surgical strikes.\n\nYeh lo.'
'THESE are the issues we need to raise to support our armed forces and forces of law and order.\n\nStanding up and saluting National Anthem and banning Foreign Actors out of pseudo-patriotism and then going back to everyday affairs is not going to contribute anything.'
"12.6% of the central government expenditure was for defence in 2016-2017. The mods budget at that time is 3,40,921.98 crores which is 2.26% ofIndia's GDP. \nhttp://www.idsa.in/issuebrief/pay-and-perks-india-defence-budget-2016-17_lkbehera_030315.\n\nHence the govt should not be tell how bad the soldiers got. If the soldiers are not given facilities it is only govts fault.we normal Indian's have paid our share to give them better facilities and thst has not been correctly used. Everyone keeps on telling how the soldiers are facing difficulties.But we have toiled and given money to change it yet this continues. \n"

"'Shoot the messenger' like always"
'>Describing his behaviour BSF said, “He was a habitual offender of absenteeism without permission, suffered from alcoholism, and misbehaved with superior officers; and for this reason, he has served mostly in headquarters under the supervision of some dedicated superior officer.”\n\nThey just admitted that this guy is likely to know  the corrupt dealings in the headquarters.'
'Well apparently poor chap will be put on some disciplinary action for spilling the truth out!! I guess corrupt officers won the day and its business usual!'
'Very convenient. Did you think any government will entertain such a exposure. '
"Just not by the enemies. But still they are dying and that's important."
'Yes, let see how we can fit our political leanings into this... thats the right way forward.'
"Better than Vyapam'd."

'Funny they say he is alcoholic and talking BS. What about the cook in his video who echoed the same opinion. Must be high on opium ?'
"I'm pretty sure that was sarcastic "
'please point out to Kher. He repeats this in reply to anything which is against his point of view'
"BSF jawans are Soldiers as long as they are glorified by the media as propoganda tools by the politicians as Martryed Desh Bhakt.Yes they frikkin' are."
'I will be courteous. No. '
'this was humor. He did not actually say it.ohh God '
"yeah, can't take no humor no more? Is it because it is not suitable to your leaning or is it because soldiers are dying? "
"Lel. RBI might come up with this solution for him, since it's a political arm of the govt now anyways."
'Remind me in March, and I shall arrange. He is not disposable right now. He mentioned it is classified, my guess is he must be doing a course at one of their academies ;) '
'To be clear,  this is not the army,  but BSF which comes under the Home Ministry '
'thx mate. the respect for him almost dropped. '
"Seriously man, these Bhakts are such idiots. Their IQ is not even, half as much as, of us super smart liberals. \n\nSoldiers dying is so funny, why can't they just laugh at it!  "
'Garam masala at times. The *tadka* needs more stuff. This is what makes the dal taste good. Onion, zeera, ginger/garlic, tomatoes. \n\nPS: North Indian recipe '
"> But the point is they were basically their own subsidiaries. Now when u sell an inflated electricity adn pay inflated coal price - the profit is not going to indonesia - it is actually going to you\n\nIs that really true? If Indonesia increased their prices, those prices would apply to any company exporting Indonesian coal. If what you're saying is true, anybody can bypass the Indonesian regulated price by buying coal mines in Indonesia."
'And yet, the government would have you believe that corruptio has been wiped out under the new regime!\n\nVery good post, BTW.'
'India is corrupt beyond belief. Every industry is corrupt. Why do you think Rajan was kicked out for trying to solve the loans issues. Anyways all this is already collapsing.'
"Good post. Hopefully cheap solar, wind and batteries will make coal power unviable soon; though I wouldn't be surprised if these guys make the government pass a law to support their investments.\nThis is a good example of why distributed power (rooftop solar and batteries) can be a good model to aim for. When monopoly services become big businesses the customers usually lose."
'All this for an industry like coal which is going down worldwide?'
'India has become for the rich &  powerful by the rich & powerful.  \nWe are just mere salves, indirectly slogging our life for these people.  '

"Why isn't this at the top? I remember when fact-checking posts were always upvoted on /r/india. Sigh."
'not everyone is corrupt\n\nI have high hopes from our upcoming generation and I am sure they would do a better job in improving the way our country works '
'That guy was really cool! Could never attend any seminar or his talks but was amazed the more I read about him.'
'Well Adani is into solar as well. He can do the same thing there.'
'I love your optimism. More like foolishness. This is called oligopoly where multiple companies come together to loot the customers.'
'Where in that comment did you find any substantial evidence in support of this statement contained in that comment itself:\n\n> The rise in Indonesian coal prices benefited the Indonesian government and not the miners. The incremental money, when benchmarked, was taken away as royalty.'
"Hope is a good thing, I agree but most of our 'current and upcoming generation' is bobs and vagene crowd."
'Hope is a good thing, dufrense but the upcoming generation is up against corrupt spartans.'
'Why would they regulate the prices otherwise if not to generate revenue.  Anyways I was just replying to op based on what he said.  So either the source is in his description or its totally bogus and a creation of my imagination '
'It is not a scam as OP described it.\n\n\nCould there be over invoicing in coal? Yes. Why would a company do it? If Adani is supplier of coal for its plant, it might want to keep profits outside power company as power company has debt. That is a scam. Or it could be ntpc buying coal and coal supplier claiming higher market prices. That is a scam. \n\nThe article claims that price of coal in Indonesia is around 37 USD and shipping is 10-12(effectively 50 USD) price whereas they are selling at usd 82. However, the article is missing port handling charges (4-5 USD on each side), insurance, any further transportation cost depending on delivery point, storage costs, profit margins etc. I am not even sure if 37 USD is a fair estimate.\n\nAFAIK, over invoicing of equipment which Adani is facing is primarily for transmission projects and not power plant. Transmission projects are bid out but there is a cost plus scheme for transmission projects. '
'Generally, the chain of fact checking and subsequent rebuttals is the top comment chain, not a generic comment about X being good Y being bad which doesn’t further the discussion or inform anyone of anything. This comment was a good starting point for such a chain.\n\nAt least, that used to be the case.'
'What if suddenly solar cells cost thrice as much...Adani can only pass on the bill to you like in the case of coal.'
"Disagree. Has happened often that generic comments have been at the top. \n\n\nAlso, this comment itself contains unsubstantiated claims that seek to whitewash. *Jumlebaazi*, really. Such comments rightly shouldn't be at the top. \n\n"
"It's not Adanis monopoly, its a cost effective product. If he raises the price, competitors will bypass him. \n\nElectricity on the other hand is a high investment business and there usually exist monopoly/oligopoly."
"The submission by OP is detailed and includes facts supported by sources. \n\n\nThe top comment at the moment reminds you how the current rulers would have you believe *aal ij vel* and *acche din*s are upon us, because they've allegedly wiped out corruption!\n\nIn fact, the comment you apparently liked so much seeks to obfuscate by incorporating subtle *jumla*s which is why it's best relegated to below top. Also, if you indeed agree said comment isn't free of spin, let us see if comments in response to that one, which nail or question that spin, are upvoted more than that comment itself. Gut feeling is, that won't happen. Because we live in an age of brigades and armies in charge of propagating feel-good zeitgeist.\n\nEdit: replaced a phrase"
"I prefer it when the top comment doesn’t confer political opinion on me, I would rather it distill facts, then I can draw my own conclusions.\n\nBut that’s just how I reddit.\n\n> Gut feeling is, that won't happen. Because we live in an age of brigades and armies in charge of propagating feel-good zeitgeist.\n\nIsn’t this what I was lamenting? Earlier, all factual posts or posts that tried to deal with things in an objective fashion were upvoted and senseless commentary was downvotes. Now the reverse is true. The repetitive cow jokes come on top, and the substantive comments at the bottom. However it is hardly the feel good zeitgeist on this sub, more like the opposite.\n\nI prefer to sort by controversial now, rather than top on this subreddit at least. \n\nAnyhow, this is my personal preference, if you prefer it the other way good for you I guess."
"If there's one thing bjp fanboys and bjp knows, it's that money spent on ads about achievements fetches way better results than spending the money and effort on actual achievements. Gujriot model\n"
'BJP single handedly saved the print media industry during the national elections.\n\nThe marketing industry owes him a debt of gratitude too.\n\n@OP After the riots, our proud PM did say his only regret was not managing the media better. Dude is following through on this after all.'
'We are living in post truth era. Modelling public perception is more important than actual work done. '
'Do remember that one of the biggest argument that government uses in courts to justify aadhaar is that 115 crore people have already gone for it. As if they have gone for it willfully by choice and have seen benefits from it. This ad campaign would further promote the propaganda that everything is alright with the platform and people with aadhaar are getting all the benefits they were promised. Government is not going to show you the real people who are struggling to get food and work because of aadhaar related problems. The activists do. '
'How is this NP ? '
'i dont mind spending money for promoting government schemes, even if they come dipped in praise by ruling party, reason being government has been and currently spending way too much money on various schemes, but progress is much slow, if promotion of schemes, make people aware of the schemes, i am game.'
"Ad Agencies always keeps tabs about their loyal customers. They give them the illusions that Ad is the only method what people drives towards the products.\n\nBrand loyals would buy it, haters will criticize it, but confused will see which side is the strongest. Ergo, it is entirely up to the people. Win win for both Modi and PR companies. A necklace is sold for it's design, not because of how much carat of gold is in that."

"#How can aadhaar data be misused?\n\n- the govt is forcing citizens to first get aadhaar and then link it with bank account, mobile, pan to enforce **complete surveillance** by the govt. Under this scheme, **every citizen is guilty unless proven innocent**\n- enrollment has been outsourced (to companies owned by members of UIDAI - conflict of interest). This is a point of **data leak**. Due to such leaks of private citizens' data, there are private companies which offer background checks for a fee.\n- once enrolled, UIDAI can cancel or deactivate your aadhaar number with/without citing any reason. **Entire demographies can be excluded from govt schemes**, without assigning any reason.\n- citizens who differ from the govt in their political and/or religious views / sexual orientation (LGBTQ) can be targeted by the govt with pinpoint accuracy.\n- with your aadhaar number, companies like **jio** can access all the details that you gave at the time of enrollment. They can and will build a digital profile of every aadhaar card holder. This **digital profile will be sold to the highest bidder**\n- if and when you link your aadhaar to bank account, read the fine print. You are **authorizing the bank to share your data with 3rd parties**\n- remember the riots of 1984. Mobs went on rampage with voter lists in hand. With aadhaar data in hand, such **violence can be even more accurately targeted by mobs.**\n- if you use your fingerprint to make payments, unscrupulous merchants or hackers can **store your biometric** and then **transact from your bank account** *without you being available physically.*\n- if you find a **vulnerability** in the aadhaar system, you cannot report it. Only UIDAI can. If you report it, UIDAI will file an **FIR** against you, citing **National Security**\n\n**These are the top few scenarios**\n\n#What can you do?\n\n- till Supreme Court constitutional bench convenes and decided if aadhaar infringes citizens' right to privacy, **do not enroll for aadhaar**\n- read this: http://perry4law.co.in/news/?p=252\n- mobile company calls you it texts you to give aadhaar for eKYC. Give existing id documents. Ignore.\n- bank calls you or texts you to give aadhaar for eKYC. Give existing id documents. Ignore.\n- you make a purchase and merchant asks you for your mobile number. Tell them, I don't have a mobile number. If you really have to give a mobile number, give a secondary mobile number that is not linked to your bank account   "

'All credit to Modi'
"Wow so many people blaming Modi for corruption here. The report is about low level corruption and infact most people in the survey believe that government is headed in the right direction in crubbing corruption and are hopeful of the future. But don't let me stop the circlejerkking. "
"And there won't be any, sadly"
"> If you are worried about this, let me tell you: it will only get worse from here.\n\nExactly!\n\n\nIf there's one thing Narendra's doing right, it is the gradual but definite dismantling of the secular-Hinduphobe complex. What's more, the rise of the Right worldwide has severely curtailed the chances of 'outside' help to these Fifth Columnists."
'Yup, read the article and saw that people were optimistic in India, came back to randia and was not disappointed.'
"You read the actual article, and not just the title? Nerd. Don't ruin muh circlejerk."
'53%, 41% and 59% of the sample size, most probably from BJP ruled states. percentages are in line with the number of bigots who continue to support BJP/modi'
"Considering a majority of Indians polled in the study said the government is doing a good job of decreasing corruption, I wholeheartedly agree. \n\nCan't wait for the electorate to send a thumping message to corrupt parties by giving Modi another broad mandate in 2019. "
'> A survey (with a small sample size) about what people "THINK" is meaningless. What people think doesn\'t matter as much as what people "DO". \n\nSo a survey of small sample size, of what people "think" is meaningless but it\'s good enough to measure the level of corruption in our country. \n\nThanks for this insight. '
'What people think is extremely important because they decide who will form the govt. In 2014, corruption was a big issue that sinked Congress to all time low. In 2019, corruption would hardly be an issue since majority of people feel that Modi govt is largely corruption free. The sample size for this study was 2,802 which is actually quite large (not small). The margin of error for this sample size is only 2%, so it is pretty accurate.'
"BJP and its allies control 18 states in India. Population wise nearly 70% of India's population is under BJP/NDA control. Calling 900 million people bigots is pretty audacious on your part. "

'Good one, they might even be jerking off on this one too. '
'it only shows that most people who continue to support modi/BJP only do it because they are bigots, not because of development and other assorted jumlas'
"They declared demonetization a success and claim the stock market is the best indicator of our economy, so ya what the other guy said..they'll say see number 1 toh hain!\nTo commemorate, statue banate hain"

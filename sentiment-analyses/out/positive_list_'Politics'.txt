"It's nice to see some good in the news once a year."
'"The most beautiful thing in the world is to see a child smiling. The next best thing is to know that you are the reason behind that smile." \n\nThe officer must have had a moment of euphoria after seeing that smile.'
'What an adorable picture! Looks like the baby cracked a joke or something to cheer things up. '
'/r/titlegore aside, fantastic picture!!'
'I love how everyone is so happy in this photo!'
'Sweet :-) .\n\nSource: https://twitter.com/AddlCPCrimesHyd/status/916685135885377536'

'So cute'
'Made my day :) \n\nIs there any link to the story?'
'Does your entire nation have perfect teeth?'
'Hey mods , This is on reddit front page. Might want to welcome r/all post the rules.'
'The smile is contagious. Almost everybody is the picture is smiling. '
'part of me thinks the baby is about to do something mischievous but cute, like peeing his arms '
'You made me happy, wishing you a happy childhood beta.'
"There's a lot of good looking people in this photo "
"I'm pretty sure the baby is laughing thinking that that person has extra hair on his upper lip."
"Hah, cute kid.\n\nMy only memory of Hyderabad was getting an 'interesting' pat down in the airport when I was connecting on the way to Nagpur; Some days I still wonder if that guy misses me as much as I miss the way he caressed my genitals like he expected to find true love down there."
"That's such a sweet smile :)"
'God bless the officer '
'great work ....appreciated'
'Pleasant picture'
'Really a beautiful sight to watch! '
'Good way to start my day.  Thanks for posting this!'
'for a second i thought the baby was rescued from a team of kidnappers calling themselves "Thrill the Internet"'
'The kidnapper in the back looks pretty happy as well'
'This movment would the best movement of the police officer ..... '
'They have nice teeth. That third guy...unf'
'Photographer deserves extra kudos for the framing. '
'The kid looks like a teenager shrunk to baby size.'

'can confirm am thrilled'
'Saved by the looks of that moustache India Stalin '
'He looks like Freddie Mercury.'
'Beautiful picture, good way to start the day. Kudos to the cops.'
'The baby gave the most needed encouragement'
"That made me smile. It's genuine happiness! ʘ‿ʘ"
'This is such a positive image. '
'This is *fabulous*! He looks so cute and happy :3'
"The baby gave the most needed encouragement with that smile to do their work and experience the same kind of satisfaction always.\n\n\nIt's up to the cops how to take that"
'And they all have perfect teeth '
"You mean it's nice to see people doing their jobs? What has the world come to"
'> "The most beautiful thing in the world is to see a child smiling. The next best thing is to know that you are the reason behind that smile."\n\nIs this a real quote, or something that you just felt like putting in quotes?'
"makes sense, it must be the baby that cracked the joke; because we all know cops don't have a sense of humor."
'Maybe he just pooped in his pants and is very relieved'
'The baby read a funny tweet! '
"He didn't get the baby's joke. He'll laugh when he gets it don't worry. "
'Thank you. I hope OP does the same and adds the source too.'
"I wonder why the baby was kidnapped? Ransom? It's so wonderful that he was rescued, but the fact that this happens at all is horrifying."
'I love this photo. '
'there is hope'
'Looks like this made to the front page!'
'Lol he took off his knee pads to get on his knees.'
'should win nat geo photo of the year.. so deep man and pure!'
'I love his guard stance '
'Whats the deal with that baton? It looks like clear plastic with sand in it. Any special reason for having that?'
'Nationalism, Hindu, Secular...whenever these words are used in a thread, people start jumping from their seats to claim that their definition is the only correct one. \n\nIt almost sounds like my imaginary God vs your imaginary God. \n\n\nYou need to relax guys.\n\n'
'Can we all agree that both religions are really fucking stupid?'
"If the muslim's god is real, shouldn't *it* stand guard?"
"I too understand that this is a positive thing to share, but isn't religion being an unnecessary risk to life of someone who's not even a follower of the said religion, here, by the fact that the soldiers would be better off if both of them were on the lookout for each other rather than one stopping to conduct his body in a fashion to appease an imaginary being?"
'The dude in the back is ready to use the sword to defend his buddy'
'And they are both accepting of mind-poison. Bummer.'
"There's something marvellous about a mustachio'd policeman like that."
'Khada hoke timepass kar raha hai aur isme top post bana di'
'1. "Hindu" (how do you know?) guard is not guarding the muslim comrade while he does namaz. He is doing what he would have done regardless - guard/patrol whatever it is they were assigned to.\n2. Not something to be encouraged. He is supposed to be guarding something and he is not. '
'Why is the guy standing guard holding a big baton with his trigger hand? Seems like it get in the way if he actually had to defend the guy'
'Actually a great photo. But seriously, would a Muslim protect a kuffars right to carry out their religious practices?'
"Looks like that cop is wearing snake gaiters. Maybe he's standing watch against snakes."
'Wow! Thanks man!!! '
"As John le Carré put it in The Russia House, 'Nowadays you have to think like a hero, merely to behave like a decent human being.'"
"Sure if you give me a sword and an assault rifle.  I'll gladly follow you around all day to defend your rights.\n\n*I'd also like about $30 an hour to do so*"
'How the world *is* and how the world *ought* to be are often two very different things. Seeing acts of kindness like what is shown in this picture restores some of my faith in humanity.'
'> normal thing\n\nwould be not requiring anyone to stand guard while you pray. But I agree with your point of human decency.'
'Yes it is but the New normal is being structured differently '
'The not-normal thing is that a Muslim security personnel needs someone to watch his back while he prays in the streets of a Muslim majority state. '
'> Indian peace '
'The older generation is already too brainwashed to get out of the muck. We have to make sure the next generation is not pulled down similarly.'
'no. we all need mirrors to remind ourselves that there is still good in this world. however obvious that might be. '
'Religion can provide psychological support. Let the man pray if he wants to.'
'Maybe he does it especially because he is in such a crucial time? Hoping to have God on your side is very helpful in such dire situations.'
"There's a belief that offering namaz five times a day is necessary if you want to get in heaven. "
'Lets see if this works better than "gadhe ke poot yahan mat moot"'
"I don't understand the logic of what the billboard is saying.\n\nI also don't litter, but I just want to keep my city clean.  It has nothing to do with a class system."
'Yeah because only people who know English do the littering'
"I'm creating jobs. /s"
'OP, where in Gangtok is this? Just curious. I have never seen this before. '
"The implication being that the point of education is to teach people not to litter? The intended message is good but there's not much logic to that argument."
'Sikkim is an amazing place.\n\nAnd Indians are not "educated" people, they are "literate" and "degree holders". Real, proper \'education\' in this country only partially exists and is not available to most.'
'I dont know If I should laugh at this or feel bad.'
'The point is to make sure they have a job despite their lack of education. Duhhhh'
'Smart campaign! '
'Challenge Accepted'
'Good creating a job opportunity and paying them with my tax money'
'i live in gangtok and when i saw this poster, i was like is it ok if an educated person picks it up...\n'
'As much as I would love to lecture litterers, picking up after them in plain view is often the best message you can send.'
'I have spent probably 6 months backpacking through India. People would grab my chip packet or chai cup from my hand and throw it on the ground and then give me mean looks without saying anything. It was SO WEIRD. This was both on and off the train. At historic sites, on train platforms, it happened a few dozen times. I started trying to hide my trash in my hand more because of it. The people most likely to do it seemed upper class and most likely to be old, professional dudes.'
"That's almost as good as the Mercedes woman and vegetable vendor story "
'mate, the degrees mean squat when it comes to civic sense. This kind of "education" is about teaching kids then they are young (say primary school). Your fancy PhD is not going to make you a better citizen. '
"Education is learning for its own sake. You don't need to teach anyone about not throwing garbage. It's common sense. It's about civility, not education. \n\nCivility comes from civilization: the stage of human social development and organization which is considered most advanced. Civil is related to City meaning a place where huge groups of people live together as a community. It is the understanding and awareness that humans are meant to help each other out.\n\nEducation as we use it today is more specific to a particular skill like math or programming or medical care. A doctor who commits female foeticide is educated but uncivilized."
"That's why randia loves Tharoor"
"Yeah I'm not getting the logic of the statement...only uneducated litter but also only uneducated clean litter? So no one get educated?"
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't get it. Is it related to some indian idioms that aren't sort of colloquial english? "
'And then they elect BJP, the party which literally started the clean India movement. *Ironic.*'
'Duppata of truth '
'Nice :)\nSari is the armour? '

'People commenting here should really think outside the stereotypes set (sometimes by themselves) about Indian women.\n\nI find this to be a very neat attempt. All the key features of the WW costume check out here as an Indianized version.'
'Pretty cool. Lasso is missing though.'
'This is cool. She is beautiful. Photo is amazing. Her( and team) attempt is commendable. Wow, but boy does this ruined my imagination of Indianized wonder woman. Danm that cosplay could have been better. *slow clap for opening new path for future cosplayers who attempt this*'

"my dad is in the army so i have seen many states/cities and their roads. Dehradun, Bikaner, Hyderabad, UP west (countrysides) have mostly very good roads. I cant even remember a city with quite a lot bad roads or maybe i am just lucky. But i can say that roads a decade ago were pathetic, i mean really really pathetic, those days roads in villages were a joke, made up of bricks, even plain earth was less bumpier than those old village roads. But still there's a LOT to improve in our roads and their safety, proper road signs everywhere are a must these days and govt should do something about it, but they won't. Still i would say improvement is there but there's a lot to do yet\n"

'Instead, they can have the names of official who were responsible for approval of tender and inspection of work on each road. If the gatekeeper is afraid of implication, then he will do a better job.'
'It is already done in Bangalore but it is a company not the name of the contractor. Tendersure roads that is footpaths also have name of contractor(also company name). In the case of roads it has improved quality is doubtful. The roads are resurfaced every year, so obviously there are no pot holes, but this is unnecessary work as roads need to be redone only once in 5 years. People get good roads but their tax money is drained and wasted. Giving contract for say 20 years may be better, then they will try to reduce the material and work, but with some obvious cons.'

'Well only if the intention is right. Concrete is obviously more expensive but better in long run. In Netherlands, roads are made off a special material that absorbs the rain water and thus they have a fantastic under ground water storage system. \nLike they say Mehnga ek baar, sasta baar baar. '
'Yea agreed. Concrete roads are far better in terms of durability. However I think they are more expensive and also offer less grip in wet conditions. '
"First of all that black goo like material used in road construction is not tar but bitumen. You can have perfectly built roads of bitumen, it's just shoddy construction quality which causes nothing to stay on road in rains.\nThe only disadvantage of concrete roads is their initial cost."
"Concrete roads are definitely better but high quality tar roads and a good drainage system is definitely something that works. Some of Goa's roads for instance hold really well. Especially the highways. And Goa's heavy rains are well known. Similarly in Gurgaon, roads built by private developers like DLF for their own use, the expressway, MG. Road all of them have held up well."
"What you are saying is 100% correct in my opinion. I'm thinking you want to **War Dogs** this shit? I am somewhat involved in the infra sector, specifically relating to government road tenders. One problem is that the government departments only lay down the standards for construction of roads before tenders are out, and after meeting qualifications, the person with the cheapest bid wins. So how do you incorporate better materials and processes alongside cheapest tender costs??? "
"I know what you mean, but in essence the concept of naming a road or a location after someone is a sign of respect towards the achievements of the individuals. Having already given disproportionate veneration to those less deserving, I'd prefer if we shied away from giving it to those even less deserving. "
"This is the case with most metro cities in India, normal cities are much much better in road and infrastructure, and also they have a lot less traffic. It's just peaceful.\nBtw I am an alumnus of army public school, Bikaner  😊"
"I think the best way to go about it is to plan beforehand so that you'd not ever have to dig the road at all. Plan for everything for years in advance. Check if the any lines need to pass through and make arrangements for that, build a bigger drainage system that'll do for years etc."

"Upcoming Oped of NYT:\n\nAfter the Indian space agency ISRO launched the so called 100 satellites, on the back of the subsidies provided by the Government, the Indian cartoonists went on an overdrive mocking a cartoon published in this newspaper some time back. We agree that launching satellites is still considered an achievement despite it becoming a commonly available technology and for that we congratulate ISRO, a government funded organisation mostly employing upper caste Brahmins form Southern India. The 88 of the hundred satellites were intended for a single project and will be counted as a single satellite in the developed world bringing down the number of satellites launched to less than twenty, it's though a small detail which shall be overlooked in the interest of the billion impoverished souls who rarely get something to celebrate.\n\nIn the spirit of cartoons and humor we welcome the criticism but this success is also a warning to the mankind in its endeavor to conquer the outer space. Space has been hitherto reserved to an elite club of western countries and Russia, all of whom have been cautious enough to keep it orderly and clean. However with the frequent invasions of the Space by the emerging Asian powers of China and India, the debris is becoming a huge risk to our planet. There is no central organisation like NATO which controls the space at the moment. However time has come for the western countries to work towards a common goal of keeping the skies clean and not let it reduce into an open defecation designated zone. \n\nIndia's ability to launch objects into the space at low cost, while praiseworthy also increases the risk of accidents and collision in the space which might result into debris falling over New York city or even London. We must act now and regulate the satellite launches taking examples out of the successful NPT and NATO treaties.   "
'This is good. we should do more achievements'
"Notice how they took off the hand rails? Probably used in the satellite production. Because we Indians are jugaadus and don't need no million dollar material for our satellites. Subtle. "
"It's a great cartoon, only problem is the things they're holding are rockets, not satellites. "
"At last, something sensible from TOI. \n\nIt's a relief after all those celebrity stories. "
'India\'s like, "we\'re bringing the cows with us".'
'TOI for all your garbage pop up ads I cursed this is just amazing you deserve a round of applause 👏.'
"I'm not offended by the original comic in the slightest. But the artist did try to poke fun at India's achievement back then. But it's all in good fun. It's a joke. There is some truth to it and all the comic did was exaggerate. Hyperbole is a common trait of jokes. That's literally how a lot of the jokes work. Nothing wrong with it.\n\nThat being said, the response was pretty funny and super witty. Very appropriate. The NYT artist was absolutely BTFO'd. "
"On the other hand; it's nice yes; but it's not *that* big of an achievement... "

'This is a response to the same in the same tone I believe. I think the cartoonist of the response owned the portrayal of India and took pride in it. It shows that he has a sense of humor. '
"Not sure how the media in India is reacting but I like this comic's response. It is humous and in the same vain as the original. I think India is allowed to boast about this one, it is a huge global achievement. "
"And Indians providing a platform for scientists to push their abilities to the limit is not considered to be a form of advancing human development? \n\nTelecommunications satellites that enable people even in the remotest regions of the country to get in touch with one another don't advance the HDI?\nWeather satellites that give advance warnings of natural disasters and provide people with forecasts don't advance the HDI?\n\nMilitary satellites that help enhance the security and thus the stability of a state do not enhance HDI?\n\nOh no, they did it all for a boast. That was the real purpose. You perceptive circle-ejaculator you! No, but you're right. You are the only real patriot here because you care for the people of the country.\n\nHowever, if you don't see how this helps the people of India, then perhaps you really won't ever see any improvement in your lifetime."

"Religion is not supposed to be a burden. Naturally people have the tendency to become very convinced that what they know is the truth, through their personal lifetime (but limited) experiences and it's then easy to make the mistake to accept it as a fundamental truth.

'\n"The Secular State"\nSeptember 5, 1973 \n\nPrabhupada: All over the world, they are expecting something spiritual enlightenment from India. That is a fact. But our government is callous in that respect. Therefore any so-called swami, yogis, come from India, they gather to receive him, to hear something from him. Yes. This is the tendency, that... The real thing is that people expected something... Still they are respectful to India on account of the spiritual enlightenment. That I have studied. Still they go to India to have some spiritual enlightenment. And actually we have got this in India. If anything has to be learned about spiritual, then it is only India. That has been admitted by one Chinese gentleman. He\'s a learned scholar. His book is recommended in New York University. I forget his name. He has written in his book that "If you want to learn something religion and spiritual, then you must go to India."\nAmbassador: It must be Lin-yu-tang, no.\n\nPrabhupada: Eh?\n\nAmbassador: Was it Lin-yu-tang?\n\nPrabhupada: I don\'t know.\n\nAmbassador: Yu-tang. You see he\'s a very great admirer of (indistinct)\n\nPrabhupada: And that\'s a fact. But our Indian government is not very serious about it.\n\nAmbassador: No, we have a difficulty, Your Eminence. We have got a problem in India because we have got this multi-religious society. So we have to be careful. But individuals can...\n\nPrabhupada: No...\n\nAmbassador: Because we have got to be... We should not be misunderstood. As a government, we should not take too strong a policy about any particular religion, even though it is the religion of the majority of the people.\n\nPrabhupada: No, no, no. It is the duty of the government... Secular state means neutral to any kind of religion. But it is the duty of government to see that people are religious. Not that "Because government is secular, let the people go to hell."\n\nAmbassador: No, that\'s true.\n\nPrabhupada: Yes. If you are Muslim, and, it is my duty as government to see that you are actually acting as a Muslim. If you are a Hindu, it is the government\'s duty to see that you are acting as a Hindu. If you are a Christian, it is the government\'s duty. You cannot give up religion. Dharmena hinah pasubhih samanah. If people become irreligious in the name of secularism, then they are simply animals. So it is the government\'s duty to see that the citizens are not becoming animals. He may profess a type of religion. That doesn\'t matter. But he must be religious. That is secular state. Not that secular state means government is callous, "Let the people become cats and dogs, without religion. Government doesn\'t care." That is not good government. What do you think?\n\nAmbassador: I think, Your Eminence, there\'s a lot in what you say, but, you know, politics is the art of the possible.\n\nPrabhupada: No. No, politics means to see that people are advanced, citizens are advanced, not that they are degraded.\n\nAmbassador: Your Eminence, I agree, but I think the duty of the government primarily is to provide conditions in which gifted people, spiritual people like you, leaders like you, can function. More than that, if the government does, it might probably even corrupt the religious... I don\'t know. Like an umpire in a game, you know, or something... Provide the conditions, provide the conditions for free speech. Not like Moscow, you know, where it is...\n\nPrabhupada: No. That is... Just like you have got the Commerce Department. Government has got. What is the duty of the Commerce Department? The government must see that the trade enterprise, common share, or industrial enterprise, they are doing nicely, properly. The government issuing license. They have got supervision. They send sometimes, what is called, inspectors? Education. Say, for education. There is educational inspector, school inspector. They go see that the students are properly being educated in that school. Similarly, government should have expert men in the government to see that the Hindus are acting like Hindu, Muslims are acting like Muslim, and Christians are acting like Christian. The government should not be callous about religion. They may be neutral that whatever religion you profess, government has nothing to do. You do nicely. But it is the government\'s duty to see that you are doing nicely, you are not bluffing. That is government\'s duty.\n\nAmbassador: Probably, as far as moral conduct is concerned, but more than that, how is it possible, you know? For the inner man in the spiritual mind, each individual can conceive his own philosophy, but the external conduct, the, the, what is called...?\n\nPrabhupada: No, no. External conduct means on religious principle.\n\nAmbassador: This is what I was...\n\nPrabhupada: Yes. Harav abhaktasya kuto... I... You can, you can...\n\nAmbassador: Yes.\n\nPrabhupada: ...understand Sanskrit.\n\nAmbassador: Yes.\n\nPrabhupada: Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah [SB 5.18.12]. If one has got faith and devotion to God, God is one... God is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Muslim. God is one. So religion means according to... Not according to... This is the Vedic conclusion.\n\nsa vai pumsam paro dharmo\n\nyato bhaktir adhoksaje\n\nahaituky apratihata\n\nyayatma suprasidati\n\n [SB 1.2.6]\n\nOne must be religious. Without being religious, he cannot be satisfied. Therefore there is confusion, dissatisfaction all over the world because, because people have become irreligious. If you want to keep... In Calcutta, there was, in the American Consulate Office, I was invited. There, they have got a department: "Indo-American Cultural Society." Perhaps you know.\n\nAmbassador: I heard about it.\n\nPrabhupada: I was invited there to speak: "East and West." So I explained that so far we are concerned, we have no such thing as east and west. But still, there is difference between east and west that in the Eastern countries, especially in India, even in the remotest part of the village, a cultivator, poor cultivator, he\'ll understand God consciousness very easily. And so far in the West, I talked with Professor Kotofsky... Perhaps you know.\n\nAmbassador: Yes. In Oriental Institute.\n\nPrabhupada: Yes. He said, "Swamiji, after this body\'s finished, everything is finished." You see? Such a big professor. He...\n\nAmbassador: That is Marxist materialism.\n\nPrabhupada: Eh?\n\nAmbassador: It is Marxist materialism.\n\nPrabhupada: But Marxist materialism, does it mean a congregation of some fools and rascals?\n\nAmbassador: I think so, true.\n\nPrabhupada: Does it mean they like that some congregation of fools and rascals? Such a big professor, he does not know, he cannot understand even that there is life after death. He has to accept another body. As we are accepting different bodies. I was a child. You were a child. Then I became a boy. That is different body. Different consciousness also. A child, three-four years, he talks in a different way. A boy, ten-twelve years, he talks in a different way, and a young man, educated young man, he talks in a different way. So with the change of the body, the consciousness is changing. Is it not?\n\nAmbassador: Yes.\n\nPrabhupada: Children, small children, they\'re just like animals. The cats and dogs, just they are playing, they\'re also playing like that. But he, he does not belong to that category because when he\'ll get..., he\'ll get another body in which he\'ll be intelligent. Another body, he\'ll be highly educated. Another body, he\'ll be doctorate. The cats and dogs, they\'ll have to wait to get that body. So with the body, we are changing our consciousness. So different body, different consciousness. Similarly, why not after death a different body, different consciousness? If you make progress. Yes. This is progressive. So that is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: tatha dehantara-praptir dhiras tatra na muhyati [Bg. 2.13].\n\ndehino \'smin yatha dehe\n\nkaumaram yauvanam jara\n\ntatha dehantara-praptir\n\ndhiras tatra na muhyati\n\n [Bg. 2.13]\n\nSo people cannot understand. That means they are not dhira, not even, according to Vedic conc..., not even gentlemen. One who cannot understand this simple theory, that, "After this body, as I have changed so many bodies, similarly, I shall change this body also." That\'s a fact. So dhiras tatra na muhyati. Dhira, one who has got brain, one who can think, he\'ll not be puzzled. "Yes, he has... Death means he has changed body." Any gentle, good brain will understand. But people are so foolish now, they cannot understand. They are not educated even to understand this simple thing. This is the position of the world. Even a big professor like Kotofsky. So this is the position of our present human society.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n>>> Ref. VedaBase => Room Conversation His Divine Grace A. C.

Somehow, even after watching the movie, this thought never crossed my mind that there must have been Indian soldiers at Dunkirk as well. And I am thankful for the reminder.   \n\nShould Nolan have included a few Indian faces? Yes.  \nBut I am not going to reduce this massive information to a tiny debate about movies and Nolan. The systematic suppression of information is much bigger, and our history books are equally guilty.'

I guess from Nolan's perspective ,if including an Indian character or having Indian faces contributed to the story he would have included them. If they simply added an Indian face just to satisfy the PC crowd it would have been so CRINGE lol. "

'It was a great source i have read '
'>  our history books are equally guilty.\n\nOur history books are a shameless propaganda piece of how awesome the Indian National Congress was and How Gandhi and Nehru were key to Indian independence. \n\nNever you mind that Indian independence came at a time when Britain was coming out of the WW2 and not exactly in a position to sustain a revolt in the subcontinent.\n\nAlso, omitting out HUGE sections of relevant history, for instance, my CBSE history textbooks covered the Delhi sultanate, and the mughals etc in great detail but hardly had half a chapter on the Maratha Empire which not only ended the Mughal Empire but was probably was the largest empire in the last 300 years. '
"First of all it's a British movie. If India and Indians cared so much, we should make actual historical movies that tackle history seriously. Instead we produce nonsense. Let's not blame a British director for making a movie with Brits in it. \n\nSecond - my understanding is that at Dunkirk there were no Indian combat units, only support. If the movie was about El Alamein, Sicily, Greece, Burma etc. then obviously Indian faces should be in the movie for sake of accuracy. I don't support tokenism in movies in order to check some box. "
'To add to /u/crab_hatter, Hitler had interesting views on Indians. \n\nFor almost all his life he was an Anglophile. Even after the war started. He viewed India as what (rightly so) made England the world power that it was. He explicitly wanted to replicate the English colonisation of India in the Soviet Union. \n\nHe definitely did not view the Indians as Aryans, he in fact thought as I quote this from his speech  that Indians were "infernal Asiatic jugglers".\n\nHe constantly, and in admiring terms spoke about how a superior race held sway over 100\'s of millions of an inferior race. \n\nIt was right at the end, like literally at the end, in the Fuhrer bunker, that he expressed some sympathy for Indians.  He said that he was sympathetic to the cause of Indians as opposed to the British. And this, genocidal maniac, must have had some epiphany because he also decried colonisation (coming from Hitler, that was very rich in irony). \n\nOn the Indian Legion though, he has only one stated thought on record. At around the time of the infamous Steiner scene (that has been parodied some 1,000 times), his aides told him that they had a unit of the Indian Legion at hand. Hitler apparently shrugged and said (I paraphrase), "they are useless at war, give them a task like churning prayer wheels and they will be indefatigable".\n\nIn my understanding, he viewed Bose just as he viewed Haj Husseini, a useful pawn, but with both these people, he had made up his mind to offer India (and Palestine) to the British. '
"Indians played a role in many major WW1/2 battles but Dunkirk wasn't really one of them. A few Indian faces scattered among the army would've been a good idea but the original article complaining about the movie not being diverse enough wanted a non-white portrayed as a major character. As it was, there were only a few hundred Indians among the thousands of Brits at Dunkirk."
"It's one of the best I have seen in years. There are three different timelines that sync up wonderfully, gives the movie a depth I didn't know was possible. \n\nUtterly beautiful cinematography and astounding score. Great acting, too. \n\nIt conveys the stress of the war perfectly. \n\nWhen the movie ended, half the theater was clapping. (and the other half was asleep) \nIt was a beautiful moment in itself. "

"> Oh great. Now we've got people triggered about not being featured in a Hollywood film.\n\nI've seen this kind of snark before in this context and I honestly don't understand it. I don't think it's unreasonable to point out that when someone surgically removes whole groups of people out of a story line, their sacrifice and bloodshed is tarnished, and their legacy deliberately ignored.\n\nAnd it's not just the Indians who have a strong case. The French also had a strong role in Dunkirk, but Nolan obviously only wanted to focus on the British. \n\nI get that the British experience is central to him, and that's fine. But at least *some* historical accuracy would be welcome. I don't see it as such an outrageous or unreasonable demand, hence I don't understand the snark and sarcasm."

'This whole concept of "Aryanism" is just a bunch of nonsense. Hitler believed the original Aryans were Nordic and spread to places like India but were diluted by mixing with native groups so he\'d probably see us as inferior in his eyes. \n\nNearly all the Indo-European descendants in Europe and India mixed with native populations in respective areas. If anything, the purest "Aryans" are probably the Central Asian Iranics (Pamiris, Tajiks etc) since that\'s the area the original proto-Indo-Europeans came from.'
"Sure, not gonna deny that,  British Indian troops had a pretty big role in WW1/2, but in this case (Dunkirk) not so much. Like someone else pointed out, the Dutch, French, Canadians etc had more troops in Dunkirk and even they weren't represented in the movie. \n\nThis movie was completely focused on the evacuation of troops and not on the defense lines that was slowing the Germans from reaching Dunkirk.  \n\n\nAnd as far as craving recognition is concerned, I've noticed Desis are increasingly looking for it, it's like seeking some sort of validation from the west, I see it online when some westerner does a trailer review of an Indian film and Desis go gaga over it or when some random white chick wearing a sari talks about Indian past/history and Desis share/comment/like it as if what they heard is all new.\n\n"

"You forgot the French, whose army was at least10%-ish colonial at that point. IIRC 40% colonial by war's end. Regardless, there were a ton of nonwhite soldiers in the French Army at Dunkirk and many would go on to form the nucleus of the Free French forces."

A shock to me was how Chandragupta maurya was married to the daughter of Seleucus Nicator. I mean that Indian rulers had deep interactions with Hellenistic rulers is fascinating.\n\n\nReading about various generals in the Maratha empire and their naval tactics is fun as well."
"To be honest I've never seen a book on this subject specifically (but there must be some out there). Most of my knowledge of the Indian Legion or Regiment 950 came from reading about Subhas Chandra Bose. There is also Wikipedia page dedicated to the subject.\n\nSubhas Chandra Bose, was a political dissident/freedom fighter depending on your point of view at the time. Concerned about the Independence of India from the British Raj. He created the Indian National Army, another formation of Indian POWs, however this time within the Pacific theatre, who chose to fight alongside the Japanese. \n\nThe most interesting thing about this subject in my opinion, was when the British attempted to put the Officers of the Free Indian Legion on trial. There were widespread mutinies within the British Indian Army throughout the country and brought about the end of the Raj. With the integrity of the Army in question, the further subjugation of British India was doomed.\n\nMost of this info was due to remain a State Secret until 2021 but was released early a few years back.\n"
"lol I was just trolling you , it's easy to identify newfags. Have fun here man!"

Of course we are talking about commercial cinema and not documentaries/commentaries."

'The old name is actually Bengaluru.  It became Bangalore and now back to Bengaluru.\n\nExtract: "The name "Bangalore" represents an anglicised version of the Kannada language name, "Bengalūru" ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು [ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru] (About this sound listen). It is the name of a village near kodegehalli and was copied by Kempegowda to the city of Bangalore. Bangalore was built on a venue earlier called as Shivanasamudram in the 16th century. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription on a "vīra gallu" (ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು) (literally, "hero stone", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior).

(Source: Twitter) Twitter has been buzzing with reactions to the news, with some saying that what the officer did was to be expected and should not be hailed as an achievement, while others lauded the policeman’s decision. (Source: Twitter)\n\nA policeman’s job in India is not an easy one. And though the police force is there to protect and help the citizens of this country – and they do so as well – there are times when they find themselves in a fix when dealing with VIPs. How many times have we seen policemen and women being hauled up for not giving preferential treatment to a bureaucrat or politician and the incident being caught on camera. Well, such problems don’t stop these lawmen from doing their duty, and one such example was of a Bengaluru traffic police officer, who stopped the President’s convoy so that an ambulance could pass through.\n\nTraffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction. According to an ANI report, the Bengaluru Police later announced a reward for the policeman for making way for an ambulance during the convoy movement of President Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the city for the inauguration of Metro’s Green Line.\n\nMukherjee’s convoy was headed towards the Raj Bhavan when Nijalingappa is said to have spotted an ambulance trying to make its a way towards a private hospital near HAL. The sub-inspector directed his colleagues to help the ambulance travel through the traffic-heavy road.\n\nDeputy Commissioner of Police, Traffic East Division, Bengaluru City, Abhei Goyal later took to Twitter to praise the officer’s presence of mind.\n\nPSI Sh Nijlingappa is rewarded for deftly allowing the ambulance before the 1st citizen of India. @blrcitytraffic gives way to ??, do you? pic.twitter.com/KoI2nap14N — DCP Traffic East (@DCPTrEastBCP) June 18, 2017\n\nPraveen Sood, the Commissioner of Police, tweeted, “The policeman who took such initiative to be rewarded.

'The road was closed off, to allow for the convey to pass later. \n\nHe allowed an ambulance to enter. '
"The devil is in the details.\n\n\n> Traffic police sub-inspector ML Nijalingappa, who was deployed at Bengaluru’s Trinity Circle on Saturday (June 17), has won hearts in the city and on social media alike for making way for an ambulance **even as a convoy of the President of India was to pass through a busy junction**\n\nThe keyword is 'was to pass' - it doesn't say that he stopped the President's convoy as the title suggests. Pretty sure the title is the brainchild of those two guys who are making the Bangalore Police look good -  that article was recently shared in this sub.\n\nUsually when dignitaries are supposed to pass through, almost the entire stretch or if the route is too long a considerable portion of the stretch is halted by traffic policemen. The vehicles are made to wait at the traffic junctions and this information is passed onto the security team who keep monitoring the live feed and give the go ahead for the convoy to start/move/take diversionary tactics etc. \n\nSo here it would have been a case of the traffic constable at this junction, noticing an ambulance arrive in the waiting lane and he would have taken a decision to give it a go ahead and informed of it via walkie talkie to the security team who would have delayed the start of the President's convoy."

"The dung represents what this govt has done to 60-70 years of progress and development, although slow but in the right direction. \n\nIt's not something that can't be cleaned up, but if the cow is allowed to stay in the ATM booth for too long then it will be get harder to get the shit and stench out."

'Unfortunately for some people, cities just simply grew around their farms. They swallowed whole villages in a blitzkrieg these people have never seen. I\'ve observed this in the numerous villages of delhi. Many were still debating how to deal with the expansion and things completely spiraled outside their homes. They didn\'t have the money to move with the times and the choicesbefore them were pretty tough. It was, either sell your land for some great price and lose your ancestral heritage and move out or live the same life in the middle of the urban chaos along with your cows and mud houses. people chose what suited them and there were pockets of delhi with villages in the middle of swanky offices and the nouveau riche. Slowly but surely, most villages are now selling out though. Places like Hauz khas village have lock stock and barrel rented out and sold property to clubs, cafe\'s, restaurants etc, who have still preserved the old look. It\'s an interesting transition imo. \n\nI\'m not advocating anything in particular though. These are simply my observations over the last 30 years. As we urbanize rapidly these scenes will remain common. Whether the ATM is infringing on the cow\'s space or the cow is infringing upon the ATM\'s, could turn out to be an interesting debate. I mean it in more philosophical way, of course in a literal sense the ATM operator owns the premises.\n\nI really don\'t care about the world "mocking" us either. We have to figure out what will make our urban transition peaceful and organized. For that we have to stop thinking in binary, good and bad, right and wrong. No switch flips in someone\'s head one day which makes him right from wrong. It\'s a slow transition. Think on the scale of generations. '

'"Swaach Bharath" (literally "clean India") is an initiative by the current government of India to create a sense of hygiene among Indians to keep their surroundings clean and free from garbage, and to discourage open defecations and encourage the use of public toilets by the poor. \n\nIt is mocked by Indians because the current PM of India actually just renamed a scheme of the previous government, while cutting funds for it, and indulging in publicity stunts to hide this fact. Naturally, implementation has never matched the hype generated. The cow dung inside the ATM booth highlights this failure.\n\nThe ATM (with an error message) itself is highlighting another failed initiative of our dear leader, DeMonetisation, where every Indian was declared as having untaxed money (black money) and were forced to personally acount for every penny he or she had by depositing all their cash in the bank to exchange it for new notes. The new notes had not been printed before hand, and there was shortage of cash, and a lot of Indians spent a lot of time in long queues in front of the ATM to get some cash in hand, which invariably ran out of cash quickly.\n\nThe cow is highlighting the unofficial beef ban imposed on India by our cow lover Prime Minister, who himself does not have any cow in his house, but wants us all indians to take care of a cow because he (and other religious fundamentalist friends of his) consider them a "holy animal".'

We won! 🙌\n\n[Link to the Right to Privacy Judgement](http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/pdf/LU/ALL%20WP\\(C\\)%20No.494%20of%202012%20Right%20to%20Privacy.pdf) (547 Pages 😱)\n\nSome excerpts:\n\n\n> I do not think that anybody in this country would like to have\nthe officers of the State intruding into their homes or private\nproperty at will or soldiers quartered in their houses without their \nconsent. **I do not think that anybody would like to be told by the\nState as to what they should eat or how they should dress or whom\nthey should be associated with either in their personal, social or\npolitical life.** Freedom of social and political association is\nguaranteed to citizens under Article 19(1)(c). Personal association\nis still a doubtful area.61 The decision making process regarding\nthe freedom of association, freedoms of travel and residence are\npurely private and fall within the realm of the right of privacy. It is\none of the most intimate decisions.\nAll liberal democracies believe that the State should not have\nunqualified authority to intrude into certain aspects of human life\nand that the authority should be limited by parameters\nconstitutionally fixed. **Fundamental rights are the only\nconstitutional firewall to prevent State's interference with those core\nfreedoms constituting liberty of a human being. The right to\nprivacy is certainly one of the core freedoms which is to be\ndefended.** It is part of liberty within the meaning of that expression\nin Article 21. \n\n\nAND\n\n\n> The Attorney General argued before us that the right to privacy must be\nforsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the State. In our view, the\nsubmission that the right to privacy is an elitist construct which stands apart from the \nneeds and aspirations of the large majority constituting the rest of society, is\nunsustainable. This submission betrays a misunderstanding of the constitutional\nposition. Our Constitution places the individual at the forefront of its focus,\nguaranteeing civil and political rights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for\nachieving socio- economic rights in Part IV. **The refrain that the poor need no civil\nand political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised\nthough history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights.** Above all, it\nmust be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to\ndissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government.\nThose who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the\ndischarge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic\nwelfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to reason enables the citizens of a\ndemocratic polity to make informed decisions on basic issues which govern their\nrights. **The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights\nhas been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of\nconstitutional adjudication by this Court.** \n\n\nFuck this Government. Aadhaar must die! "
"What exactly is the definition of privacy as per the judgement of the Supreme Court. I ask this question because it seems like a very vague term particularly in the context of provision of private and government services to citizens. If you take privacy at face value ('a state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people.\n'), then you could refuse to provide personal details to any individual or organization. If a bank asks for your home details for account opening, you could simply refuse citing privacy. If google asks for your phone number during account opening, you could again refuse citing privacy. And on and on for innumerable types of services. The phrase 'right to privacy' itself is not even mentioned in the constitution. The judges have made privacy a fundamental right by stating that privacy is a subset of article 21 which is 'Right to Life and Personal Liberty'. But this article 21 is utter fluff since it comes with a huge disclaimer that rights guaranteed under article 21 can be superseded by procedure established by law. Ultimately, I feel this judgement is toothless since absolute privacy cannot be achieved and is not even desirable (imagine all the rich people who don't pay taxes finding a way to hide their spending from the govt ). The govt has extensive legislative tools at its disposal to circumvent this verdict. But I do expect that in the coming months a large of individuals will petition to the courts to exclude them from providing person details to organisations. And when the courts examine the cases on an individual basis, they themselves will realize that absolute privacy is simply impossible and impractical.    "
'Faith has been restored. Take that Aadhar shoving Modi.'

Just that Privacy is a fundamental right. \n\nThe scope, extent and contours of what rights fall under the bucket of \'your right to privacy\' can be fleshed out only after reading the judgments.\n\nIt may still be possible for the govt to mandate Aadhaar verification for govt. services - so long as it is able to impress the court that\'s a "reasonable restriction to your fundamental right of privacy" - of course, now any government scheme/ law / the entire Aadhaar implementation itself is subject to the SC\'s scrutiny and any overreach and/or arbitrary govt. fiat can be swatted down by the courts as a breach of this fundamental right and hence deemed illegal.\n\nEven though I am a supporter of the Aadhar implementation overall... I\'m happy about this verdict. All in all, a good win for rights advocates and kudos to the SC. With our entire lives going digital and the sheer amount of data we share with faceless corporations - This judgment will now form a bedrock for a lot of future jurisprudence on the issue of an individual\'s privacy online for decades to come... \n\nI know many professors and seniors from college who\'ve been toiling on this issue for *years*.

'Why is that a surprise? '
"lol, let's look at an example.   \nThere's a family of 5 people. All five of them have thier own phone, but they share a common toilet. Now, you can see that this family has more phones than toilets but it still has proper sanitation and no one is street shitter.  \n***   \nNow look at India, it's like that family. It has more mobile phones than toilets, but it doesn't mean that's the reason of street shitting.   \n***    \nI can't give a longer rant sorry.

'I lived with a family of 8 and we needed two toilets. One indoor, western style and one out house Indian squat toilet.

"Every Diwali people peddle this story that festivals have a huge environmental impact. Do the math on how many tons of chemicals are burnt in the crackers nation wide, and compate it to how many tons of fuel and chemicals are consumed by the entire nation's factories and automobiles. \n\nAt best, you'd be doubling the pollution output for that one day. So your year of pollution had an extra day. Further more the rest of the regular polluting sources remain closed on account of being a holiday. When you wipe the froth off the mouth, and look at things objectively, things become a lot more clear. This is not to say we shouldn't push for less crackers. After all, the 100s of different fancy crackers are only a recent invention and people shouldn't consider it 'tradition'. \n\nBefore some self styled pollution exert types out a lengthy reply, remember factories and automobiles are only a couple of the major pollutants. Farmers burning crops after harvest results in tons of biomass being burnt. Animal husbandry is the worldwide leading source of methane pollution."

'Been there for long trips in 2008 and in 2017. One of the best countries i have ever been to, and one of the safest. All nationalities except those from India, Bangladesh and Maldives have to pay a hefty daily fee (~250$ per day, but this includes food, lodging and guides) and have to do a planned trip via an agent. Between 2008 and 2017, they have seen a heavy influx of tourists from India, most giving zero fucks about the local culture and customs and they have been gradually introducing extra steps to control the flow. A month after i went there last, i heard reports that they are now asking daily lodging confirmation before giving the permits (cant vet this atm). So my advice is - go see the country before they enforce stricter rules.\n\nRe: logistics - get in via Phuentsholing, which is around 4 hours on road from Bagdogra (or fly to Paro if you are short on time). Thimphu, their capital, is 5 hours away from the border. If you indeed get to the country, see Thimphu, Paro and Punakha (which is where 99% of the tourists end up in), and then head deeper into central Bhutan (Trongsa, Bumthang et al) and eastern Bhutan (Mongar, Trashigang, Rangjung et al). People need to take extra permits for these regions from Thimphu and not many people make the journey this far because of the time involved, but these places are heaven on earth and some of the best laid back people you will ever encounter.'
'Yea,it feels like you have travelled to another world.Hardly any pollution and red lights and people are laid back.'
'My parents just got back. Flew from Kolkata. Pretty easy traveling. They loved it but they said that the other Indian tourists were inconsiderate and littered a lot in some of the most beautiful natural places in the world. It made them sad, and they said the locals like Indians but really resent how  poorly they treat the place.'

"> I know it sounds very racist, but I really dislike the Chinese eyes and their shorter height. The queen looks kinda cute, nothing more than that.\n\nThat's like your preference/opinion which you can have (although generalizing an entire race is a stretch) \n\n> Only on this subreddit will you find Indians appreciating a person's looks who has Chinese features. All of these compliments will be found here only, go out of your house and you will find the truth. \n\nThis is just ignorant. Also, just because people don't find people of a certain race beautiful, doesn't mean it is justified to call the race ugly, it is just that people can't appreciate the beauty. "

Im proud about my short height,monolids and straight black hair,thank you very much, doesnt make me any less Indian than you.No one is trying to be politically correct here,it\'s understandable that you have (disturbingly racist) preferences but most people tend to appreciate and respect people even if they \'look\' like them.'

"Major expenditure in marriages are \n\n* clothes\n* gifts\n* catering / venue\n* photography\n\nI bought all my stuff from wholesale markets. Bought only one suit for myself.

Cut down invite list to 130-150.\n\nStill not as cheap as I would have liked but not a bank burner"
"I spent 2.5 lakhs on my wedding. We had a court marriage, but we celebrated only with close family, so 25 people came for 3 days to Kolkata (where my wife's family stays). We put everyone up in a nice hotel, ate good food and just enjoyed each other's company. That cost us 1.5 lakhs including everything. \n\n\nBack in Mumbai, my extended family was feeling very snubbed and there was lots of talk going on. I took 80 people to a fantastic dinner at a great hotel (Renaissance Powai) and that cost me just under a lakh. I booked a few Innovas for transportation, really schmoozed everyone and that was it. People were pissed for a while but they ultimately got over it. \n\nIn the end, you really have to do what's best for you. I'd rather spend the money we saved on a house, holidays, a nice car, and other luxuries. Nobody is gonna come running to give you money when you're short. Family will always help, but extended family will only talk. If they're gonna talk anyway, might as well look out for yourself and secure your future in the process. "
'There is a middle ground between a fancy wedding and a court marriage. Keep the guest count low. That is the single most important thing. You have several options - get married in a temple, get married in an Arya Samaj temple, get married in a small venue such as a community hall. \n\nYou can actually make it look elegant and sophisticated while still keeping costs low. Like i said, as long as the guest count is strictly enforced.\n\nOh yeah, skip the reception. It often costs more than the wedding ceremony. Or just throw a small private party.'
"If you feel strongly about this, trust me the girl's family will be relieved. Go ahead and have a simple wedding and wish you a very happy married life."
"In the end it's what you and your wife decide. If you want then stay adamant. Three of my friends did the same - court marriage and a small combined reception for all family members. All that Saat phere is bs if you both aren't really committed to each other and work out issues without fighting all the time. \n\nTrust me you and your fiancé should stay adamant and save the money. No point feeding obscure relatives whom you would never again meet in your life. "

'This is a joke and is not meant to be factually accurate '
"They really don't. A lot of stupid kids carry all the books which is unnecessary. "
"Well, think about it this way. In the wild the cow is vulnerable to a lot of things that would put its survival at risk. Drought, lack of food, predators and so on. So in exchange for its labour, we make sure its fed, healthy, has enough food. There is even a branch of medicine dedicated to animals, so if a domesticated cow gets a disease or gets injured it gets veterinary care. If its a cow, when it gives birth it will be supervised with a vet giving the calf and cow the best chance at surviving the process.\n\nCows are not complicated creatures. Like many other animals their only goal in life is to graze and reproduce, to increase their numbers. If you fence a few wild cows up in a few acres of grassland they will be perfectly happy. There are many more cows and general bovines alive on the planet with humans breeding them than would be without. \n\nAs long as the animals are well treated and not abused I don't see a problem with humans using them."
"Don't get me wrong. The fact that the owner has gone out of the way to provide the animal relief from the sun is really nice and should be appreciated. However I disagree with you on the view that animals should not be used as resources. Its only fair trade if humans and animals help each other. However this should be done in a respectfully way making sure that the animal isn't exploited"
"Pretty sure domesticated animals, even feral, wouldn't last very long without human interference. "

Two judges out of 5 were representative of Pak intelligence agencies. \n\n3. His ouster got nothing to with Panama papers. Nothing at all. The courts have disqualified him on some unrelated technicality which seems like a farce. He was the chairman of some company in UAE while in exile. He did not draw salary from it. However undrawn salary means it's a receivable (ie Sharif is supposed to receive it) and therefore an asset. An asset which wasn't disclosed in his nomination papers in 2013. [Here](https://www.dawn.com/news/1348211/the-technicality-that-led-to-nawaz-sharifs-disqualification)    \n\n4.

"Evicting Sharif was 100% an agenda by the Army. Historically, Sharif has been very friendly to India and his niece even married a Hindu. In this social media age, Army has gained full legitimacy from the people through propaganda, something military govts excel in. A Constitution which has failed so many times implies the judiciary isn't really independent. Our judiciary isn't independent and one thinks theirs are? Right now, the army is taunting Bhutto's party that they're next. This means Army is going to have that pushover party elected next year or IK's party which has a chunk of former PPP members."
"It's pretty idiotic comparison. One guy made the money and hid it in tax free safe haven and the other hid his money in safe haven but can't prove how he got the money.\n\nFor all idiots who are praising Pak rule of law, don't have the clue why he was disqualified.  He was outsted by Pak Army because he was undermining them."
"Typical circle jerk. Holding an offshore account is not tantamount to corruption. The super rich use these accounts for various reasons. \n\nSharif was corrupt and also had accounts and that's what nailed him. "

Now my buddy is very good in art of "keh ke lena". He decided to teach these cocky kids a lesson in humility. He turned towards the one of the guy and asked him " Do you feel cold too?"

My buddy to this girl who was on the side lower "Ma\'am can you please pass me my hoodie from the bag underneath your seat?" Ma\'am happily obliged.

Yet:\n\n> NEW DELHI: Taking a strong view of the recent deaths of manual scavengers, Delhi high court today directed the heads of all civic bodies in the national capital to be present before it on September 18 to explain how such activity was going on despite being prohibited under the law.\n\n> A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Sunil Gaur was informed by amicus curiae Sanjay Poddar that in little over a month, 10 persons have died in four incidents while cleaning sewers in the national capital without any protective gear or safety measures in place. \n\n> All of them had suffocated to death due to the toxic fumes in the sewer lines.\n\n> The court, thereafter, sought the presence of the Commissioners of the three municipal corporations, the heads of Delhi Jal Board, Public Works Department, Delhi Cantonment Board, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Divisional Railway Manager of Northern Railway. \n\n[Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sewer-workers-deaths-delhi-hc-calls-civic-bodies-heads-to-court/articleshow/60161685.cms)\n\n\nPoint is, we often mistake awesome infra alone for 'good planning'."

"> Before I came to Mumbai, traveling in local train was what worried me. I knew I will hate it and I did. \n\nHa ha.   \n\nI thought you are were a born here local. \nI knew a guy from Bangalore who got a job here & moved to Bombay. Went to trainstation in the 3 consecutive mornings without getting the guts to board the train (western line, peak hour). Finally he decided to back to Bangalore without ever visiting his company.  \n\nI had no option but to use the train for college commute. College students get a huge discount for a first class pass, so you can at least stand comfortably. Was a 1 hour 15 minute journey including the walk at both ends. Multiple trains.  \n\n> It's now been years since I have boarded one   \n\nOne of the reasons we want to do well in life is so that we do not have to take the local trains. "

'Surface area that is in contact with water.\n\nA ball of steel would drown in water but spread it thin like a sheet, it will float and even support extra weight. '
"The boat displaces enough water to compensate for the buoyancy forces. The same principle why those huge passenger ships with 10-15 stores don't sink. \n\nAnd Kerala rivers are pretty deep waters AF, so are the backwaters. So its not that easy for the elephant to swim . "

'Nice footage. Is it normal for them to bath/swim in salty water?'
'Kerala chicken roast :D I see.'
'You good man.\n\nPeople ought to be able differentiate between dark humour and colour discrimination before it all goes south.'
'Yes, elephants, unlike human do not have an effective cooling system like we do via skin and sweating. Elephants, and most mammals do swim, but not necessarily are effective at covering long distances. Elephants are huge and they need a lot of food daily so swimming, like really swimming and covering ground and exploring new territory is not within their ability. But swimming to cool of for a bit is something seen very often in elephants, but they mostly remain in shallow rivers, and do not go venturing out into the sea very often, if they do it must be with the confidence of their human caretakers, and they do not go very far out. '
'Well dark humour is already in the south.'
'Damn that compass box was the shit. Dropped it and even threw it across the classroom multiple times, still lasted for a loooong time. It was a great investment for parents 🙂'
'Aah the good old green tetrapack Frooti, the ₹20(?) Add Gel pen and the hugeass Milton water bottle :^) . When I moved to Navi Mumbai back in 2007, kids in new school made fun of 1.5L Milton water bottle. Bc from the next day itself I started bringing those small Pearlpet bottles. '
'Woah some rich guy here got to take a frooti to school. '
'Not sure how many remember but that Pen used to be the bomb. When we shifted to pens I\'d always use than pen for exams(used to cost "a lot" Rs. 25 or so)\n\nAnd covering books with parents used to be a fun time. They\'d always tell me how I can\'t cover my own book :(\n\nEDIT: The name of the pen was Add Gel Achiever. Not sure if it\'s still available'
'Add gel Achiever was like the current 1.6LPM flair. You have to be rich if you own one.'
'Is that a pilot pen? Rich kids!'
'Some compass box had that chotu wala mechanical pencil , loved that shit. And Add gel kaun use karta he? It was either Cello Fine Grip or Maxwriter.'
'I always wondered how kids even fit in that suffocating cubicle rickshaw! and ADD gel pens were <3 my bottle used to be from cello, not Milton '
"I remember putting covers on those books and notebooks for hours after getting them. Now seems such a waste but I guess our elders made us manifest the abstract respect for the concept of education to the 'things' related to education.\n\nThen I used to go through the table of contents of each to see what's in store for me for the year."
"I had that exact water bottle down to the shade of green, actually two - this and a dark blue variant (both Kool Riders). I remember starting to reuse them when I was in 6 or 7 because of the bigger capacity and since it was easier to take these compared to 2lt soft drink bottles.\nDefinitely rode that vehicle for a couple of years until I changed to a school which was a considerable distance further.\nWore those shoes, used that pen and definitely drank Frooti!. Actually the two models of pen really popular when  I had to first use one is school (Class 5) were Link Ocean gel and Reynolds Racer gel, the later primarily for pen fights because of the grip.\nGot the geometry box a lot later. The first one I got was a tin can worth shit that cost 20 bucks. It was just a box and all the stuff was bundled inside a cheap plastic packet and held together by a rubber band. No eraser and sharpner and definitely no neat padding with designated places for the scales and compasses! I remember when I got this stuff (probably in class 9) it served as a good cheating tool! I used to hide notes under the padding and made it into a makeshift pencil box so that I could use it during every subject's exam.\nThe only thing that I never used was that bag. It just didn't seem slick enough as the usual big school bag. And later the diesel ripoffs and fancy stuff with half a dozen belts and utility pockets took over (still using that stuff in university lol).\nDamn, brings back some memories!"
'That Milton bottle sure brings back a lot of memories. '
'Yay my Milton with super chilled 0 kelvin H2O'
'Been to India and drank a frooti there, thanks for bringing back tesche memories!'
'Also.. these pencils...\n\n[One with thick lead and sharpener is at the other end](http://d2ydh70d4b5xgv.cloudfront.net/images/8/0/vintage-mechanical-pencil-sharpener-lead-holder-czech-kohinor-versatil-5201-bc20fd3c1a9f76860084021fc17292a2.jpg)\n\n[Bensia pencil - where leads are in plastic casing](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mqosjY499p4/UDqRNlsk56I/AAAAAAAABdA/u5kNnx-ldIs/s1600/nonsharpeningpencil3.JPG) If you were rich, you had an eraser version of this too.\n\n[Mechanical Pencil - I still use this one](https://www.kokuyocamlin.com/uploads/product_img/109_Cpluspointpen.jpg)'
'does anyone else remember Add Gel pens, they were highly popular back then? \n\nAlso I was that one guy in my class who still had the unfashionable rectangular school bags  :('
'Choosing between the horizontal bags as in this picture vs. the vertical bags was always a tough decision. Initially had the horizontal one. The big kids were using the vertical one, so I bought that next year. Later, moved to horizontal bags again just to play with the steel locks/clips they used to come with.'
'I remember when vertical backpacks suddenly hit the markets. They were such a big deal! All the cool kids had em!'
'Ah yes the ADD Gel pen. Never wanted anything more than that in my geometry box lol'
"This is definitely some rich kid's starter pack. I never got a frooty before school, even on the first day."
'A compass box that came with a Compass, Divider, 2 Set Squares, Protractor, Pencil, Eraser, Sharpener and a Scale, that costed  about 50/- (iirc) in a FULL METAL BOX that lasts for like forever. Yep, I would say great investment.\n'
'80s and 90s. Yeah'
'Yeah nowadays kids want school bags made by some fancy american company only'
'No please bhai\n\nI used to cover all my cousins notebooks, textbooks with brown paper. My dad taught me when I was in 2nd grade and I still cover my books for MA xD'

You would be blessed to have someone like that as your relative or friend, too bad he wasn't cut out for politics. \n\nModi otoh is a scheming, uneducated, bigoted bastard."
'Yep. But with their high intensity social media presence and loud outbursts on TV, they have atleast the impression of speaking up, even if most of it is bs and lies. Modi gives enough sound bites to keep them running plus his Mann Ki Baat further helps. I know, none of this can be classified as a dialogue between two parties. But they have atleast one form of communication going on, which is relentlessly highlighted.\n\nOfcourse all political parties, especially the Congress are aware of this. They will up the ante.

'For people like me, coming from r/all and having no idea what Triple Talaq is :\n\n>Triple talaq is a form of divorce practiced in India, whereby a Muslim man can legally divorce his wife by pronouncing talaq (the Arabic word for divorce) three times. The pronouncement can be oral or written, or, in recent times, delivered by electronic means such as telephone, SMS, email or social media. The man need not cite any cause for the divorce and the wife need not be present at the time of pronouncement. After a period of iddat, during which it is ascertained whether the wife is pregnant with a child, the divorce becomes irrevocable. In the recommended practice, a waiting period is required before each pronouncement of talaq, during which reconciliation is attempted. However, it has become common to make all three pronouncements in one sitting. While the practice is frowned upon, it is not prohibited.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Talaq_in_India)'

"I really don't understand what is there to celebrate in this.\n\nMuslim men still have the right to pronounce an oral divorce, one-sidedly and it would be legally valid. Even a single divorce, after the waiting period (iddat) is enough for the couple to separate. They can get remarried later. If he does it successively 3 times in 3 months then it is irrevocable and they can't get married later. If a woman wants a divorce, she can either ask the husband for it or the court for it (khula). Only the 3 at a time, irrevocable divorce has been declared illegal by law, even that is not gonna have any effect, as nothing has changed in the Sharia, and those sects that accept it will still follow it.\n\nWhat do you guys want? That the woman still stay married to the abusive person? Coz that's what you're getting now. Legal penalty for the husband? Congrats, even the AIMPLB wants the same, and this verdict has done nothing for it.\n\nI think this divorce method, although rough, is pretty fair. It makes both one-sided and mutual divorces very easy, avoiding the mess that Western divorces usually are. There's no interference of the court, so no long waiting or lawyer's fees. What better process do you guys suggest for getting a divorce then?"

"> Will this help finally pave the way for UCC?\n\nThat was the mischevious aims of the Modi government. But it seems to have failed.\n\n> The Centre had claimed that instant talaq was not fundamental to Islam. It promised to bring a new divorce law for Muslim men in case the court strikes down Ahsan, Hasan and Biddat.\n\nThe SC hasn't banned how muslims can divorce each other, but one particular practice of the rarely used *talaq-e-biddat* or instant and irrevocable divorce. This is already banned in many muslim countries.\n\n> There are three forms of talaq  — Ahsan, Hasan and Talaq-e-Biddat (triple or instant talaq). Ahsan and Hasan are revocable. Biddat – pronouncing divorce in one go by the husband – is irrevocable. Biddat is considered ‘sinful’ but permissible in Islamic law ... ''Where will Muslim men go for divorce if you [court] strike down talaq and Parliament refuses to pass a new law?'', the AIMPLB asked.\n\nSource: [Supreme Court sets aside instant 'talaq’](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-sets-aside-instant-triple-talaq/article19538599.ece)\n\n\n\n\n"

Our MPs get  5crores in constituency development funds, and yet almost none of them are utilised anywhere. \nI have seen you are one of the few MPs who has actually used these funds. \n\nCan you tell us what these funds can be used for, and why they aren't used?

"Good Evening Mr. Tharoor, Welcome to randia.  \nI have a few questions,  \n\n1. What are your views on reservations? Should reservations based on current metric continue?    \n\n2. Will you please take up the issue of [Sand Mafia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-28/the-great-sand-heist-fuelling-india-120-billion-building/8390984) in the parliament? It's a non-renewable resource and it's not only causing large scale ecological damage that is leading to scarcity of water and killing the rivers and coasts but is costing the government a lot of money. In fact reports came that Thorium rich sand from India was being transported to China via Saudi Arabia, which in future may become a nuclear fuel.  \n\n3. what are your views on the kind of appeasement politics, TMC/SP/BSP/ and even congress indulges in to capture a specific votebank? A major resentment among the Indian voters today is due to this unfavorable appeasement that's being meted out.   \n4. Why do political parties prefer to stall the parliament, in the past BJP and now congress, why to waste the tax payers money and precious time of parliament, why not try to solve the issue amicably outside of the house or in fact debate them out in the house itself?    \n5. How is a normal day in Parliament?  \n6. Care to share an interesting anecdote from your days at UN?  \n\nThank you "

"Sorry for the long-winded comment but you've often asked the question 'Is truth a noun that can be modified by a proper pronoun?'. This is increasingly becoming the most important question of our times but seemingly the hardest to answer as well. It appears to me that although truth cannot fundamentally be isolated from its context, some truths are factually and epistemologically truer than others while at the same time someone's truths carry more weight than those of others, with no apparent correlation between the two (at least within the field of politics and governance).\xa0\n\n\nIn light of the recent events in the US, do you expect India to follow the same path? If not, why? If yes, based on your experience as the undersecretary general for communication and public information, what guidelines and institutional frameworks would you suggest be put in place to prevent this? And how can we ensure that the MPs, MLAs and more importantly the leaders of the countries are held accountable for verifiably inaccurate statements made by them during office since resulting solely on the public mandate doesn't seem to be working. \n\n"

"Hello Mr Tharoor,\n\nThanks for agreeing to this AMA. I have a couple of questions on Indian Foreign Policy as that is something you are familiar with:\n\n1. How do you view India-China relationship and its future with an assertive Xi Jinping and a seemingly leaderless USA? \n2. What do you think about the government's neighborhood foreign policy? If you disagree then what would a UPA government would have done to counter the rising Chinese influence in our neighboring states (except Pakistan as that is a special case, though please comment on that too), given the economic and political realities of India? Or do you feel that China is not a medium or long term strategic threat to Indian interests?"

"Thank you for doing this AMA! My questions:\n\n1. Do you think that the opposition is doing a good enough job of keeping a check on the government for bulldozing through parliamentary procedures like money bills, introducing amendments at the last moment etc.?\n\n2. Do you agree that the opposition spends more time arguing relatively trivial events (like campus politics) and ignores its actual mandate (raising concerns on legislation that is introduced before the house)?\n\n3. What do you think of the Aadhaar act? Is it a well-drafted piece of legislation? Are concerns about loopholes, providing UIDAI/govt. with unchecked powers exaggerated?\n\n4. What do you think about Private Members' Bills? Given a long parliamentary history of legislation not introduced by the government being soundly ignored (poor attendance, little debate), do you agree that such bills are merely symbolic?\n\n5. INC has been failing at connecting with the voters for a long time now (Punjab being the sole exception). Is a fundamental rethink of strategy on cards? What, in your opinion, could the party change to resonate better with the masses?\n\n6. Given a choice to pick any Cabinet portfolio in a future government, which positions do you think you'd be best suited for?\n\n7. What impact will events like Brexit have on global politics? How does it bode for India? Do you believe it was a one-off event, or does it signal a fundamental shift in EU dynamics?\n\n8. Would you rather fight a hundred duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?"

'Thanks for taking the time out for this AMA. I have some further questions/concerns regarding RTE and would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the same\n\n1) Given that RTE does not add any educational capacity to existing schooling system and in fact that RTE has resulted in over [7,000 schools being closed and over 10,000 other schools facing closure threat](http://www.dnaindia.com/academy/report-7000-maharashtra-schools-served-closure-notice-due-to-non-compliance-of-rte-norms-2293511), how is it possible that more kids are being brought it to educational net? \n\n2) Given that RTE laws are not applicable to minority schools, does that result in a minority school having a comparative advantage over non-minority schools especially in the budget school segments? The comparative advantage for minority schools due to RTE includes lower fees, ability to pick students/conduct entrance tests, RTE schools being required to maintain playgrounds etc. Is this not against secularism?\n\n3) Why did the UPA I government exempt minority schools from RTE through the 93rd amendment of the constitution? The 93rd amendment of the constitution includes the following\n\n> It is laid down in article 46, as a directive principle of State policy, that the State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. To promote the educational advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission of students belonging to these categories in unaided educational institutions, **other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30 of the Constitution**, it is proposed to amplify article 15.'
'Hello. Thank you for doing this AMA. \nWhat are your favourite political speeches? '
'Dear Mr. Tharoor. What is your stance on legalizing marijuana in India? '
'Namaste Mr. Tharoor,\nA casual conversation, about a year ago with an American, left me grappling for answers about the history of my country. It also led me to your recent book " An Era of Darkness ". \nWords ran back and forth with me trying to get across that it\'s impossible for "Twenty decades of colonial oppression to be undone in six", and comparing thirty decades of freedom with six. I was left humiliated and upset when he said that the \'Brutish\' left our country a better place, what with the railways and democracy, that the end justified the means. I had no answer to that. How I wish I could travel back in time, with your book and answer his smugness away.\nWhich brings me to my first question:\n1) Why aren\'t students provided with this aspect of the British Raj in schools? \nWe really need to upgrade the knowledge imparted to the young, impressionable minds.\n\nToday, The Telegraph carried an article \n\'.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/britains-biggest-landlord-bans-coloured-people-curry-smell/\nIn the wake of this article and the history of Brutish Empire \n2) Why are we so complacent about  the products "Made in England" being marketed heavily in our country?'

'Sir, I am a great fan of your work, I credit your works especially The tiger, the elephant and the celllphone for my personal enlightenment. \n\nThe first part of my questions to you is regarding your advocacy for the presidential system in india\n\n1) Wouldnt the presidential form of government be more suitable for small states? Case in point : Sir I am a resident of the state of Uttarakhand we have recurring issues of defections and shuffling of CMs due to small size of our assembly and I know for sure we arent the only small state which deals with such problems. Moreover small states tend to be ethnically homogeneous as well as easy for one person to be and executive head with limited size of government as compared to the Union government. Thus wouldnt advocacy of a presidential form of government must be done first for smaller states (say maybe <100 legislators) then move on to the Union level.\n\n2) How does the anti defection bill figures vis a vis the Persidential System? As the very bill itself means that in case of different political party controlling the legislature and the executive in a presidential form would lead to a legislative deadlock. \n\n\nNow my second group of questions to you is your role as a Parliamentarian:\n\n3) Can you please tell me how exciting is it to fight the elections? I have had plenty of experiences as child now as an adult of elections from my perspective as a voter. Whats the view from the other side of the River like?\n\n4) Any funny incidents from parliament that you would like to share?\n\nBonus question which just popped in my head \n\n5) How was mediating in the Yugoslav civil war like? What lessons could we as Indians learn from that debacle?\n\nThanks for doing the AMA'

So, some possibly hard questions from me :-\n\n* Why according to you do we see so little dissent vs the Gandhis, from a full-party perspective?  \n* Can you give us a little perspective on how the party meet went as to when BJP won big on the last few elections -> UP, Uttarakhand, Manipur etc.  \n* Whats your perspective on having broadcasted (controlled. Not your regular Tv show style debates, where its just a shouting match) debates, between the big-wigs of the party that would generally be assumed to lead the nation, or heck even the spokespersons of the party? If you are in favour of it, would you try and bring that up please?  \n* When you meet with the foreigners and NRIs, whats the most frequently asked question?  \n* How do you see Trump's relationship with India being?  \n* Favorite malayalam movie?\n* MohanLal vs Mamooty, who do you prefer more?  \n* Vella appum with stew or with Sambar?\n\nAll are super tough questions; I give that, do try to answer atleast a few of them. :)"
'What led you to join politics? What was the driving force or the so called turning point in your life which made you think that politics was where you were destined? '

"Hi Sir,\n\nIt was an honor to listen to your arguments during 2016 Jaipur Literature Fest, when you had a discussion with British MP Tristram Hunt regarding the effect of Britishers in India. \n\nYou had famously said that the only two benefits for post-colonial India were cricket and the English language.\n\nIt seems that the compensation you demanded from Britishers in exchange for the atrocities committed by them is the only issue on which you and PM Modi are on the same foot.\n\nHowever, my question is: How can you determine the amount which Britishers should pay us, to balance the mis-deeds committed by them across 200 years? And what is the purpose of this demand? Will anything change? Or will the situation of poor Indians improve? Heck, even an acknowledgement from Britishers won't shake up the system in India, when it comes to corruption, poverty and social issues.\n\nThank you for this AMA sir.. \n\n"

'[This](http://i.imgur.com/QzuJAsA.jpg) is an excerpt from the opinion of Justice Anthony Kennedy (of the U.S Supreme Court), holding that couples of the same sex have\xa0a constitutional right to wed. I found this on r/frisson, where this is one of the most upvoted posts ever.  \nThe supplement (which OP posted an excerpt from) authored by Justice Amitava Roy in the verdict of the DA case echoes the sentiment of millions of Indians exasperated by institutionalized corruption. It would have been shared a lot too, had it not been rendered nearly inaccessible by such jargon and fluff.  \nIconic speeches like The Gettysburg Address, the "Tryst with Destiny" speech or the final speech from "The Great Dictator" are etched deeply in our minds because of its lucidity. Certain amount of jargon is fine - I didn\'t know what "tryst" meant before I heard the speech and looked it up. When I downloaded this judgement on Tuesday night and read it, I had to go to the WordWeb dictionary app for almost every line ("essentia" wasn\'t there!). The Tamil news channels who were trying to summarize this mistook "causality" for "casualty", and there were lot of other stuff that was lost in translation too, mainly because of this kind of bombast.  \nI hope the judges realize the literary value of such important judgements and use more accessible language. Otherwise, it\'s only going to be like [Joey using the thesaurus](https://youtu.be/B1tOqZUNebs).   '
"For a contrast, here is the start of English judge Lord Denning's most famous judgement, *Miller v Jackson* [CA 6 Apr 1977](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1977/6.html):\n\n>In summertime village cricket is the delight of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham they have their own ground, where they have played these last seventy years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club-house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, competing with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practice while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a Judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there anymore, lie has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house on the edge of the cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that, when a batsman hits a six, the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at weekends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the Judge to stop the cricket being played. And the Judge, I am sorry to say, feels that the cricket must be stopped: with the consequences, I suppose, that the Lintz cricket-club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.\n\n"

Unfortunately for the judge writing this judgement, he comes across as an upstart who just discovered that internet has thesaurus, but hasn\'t discovered something they call "elements of style".'
"That's like a guy who's flaunting the new words he has just learnt from wordpower made easy. Utterly useless."

'When you were preparing for GRE but you parents want you to be a Supreme Court judge.  :P '
'Judgement from Supreme Court has to be in such language and in details. You should understand that this is Supreme Court, not a district court where quota judges sit and write their verdict in very basic language.\n\nThe reason for such language is that, each word in English has a specific dictionary meaning, so while writing a judgement they use the words exactly specifying what they meant. Written judgement are final, not what judges thought about the sentence that time. \n\nIf judges write some words assuming colloquial meaning, then tomorrow they can again face an appeal where lawyers used dictionary meaning for the word, and it might start the whole process again. \n\nAnd it is like Scientific Journals, if a normal person reads it, he will say..what bullshit, but an educated person in the field will understand exact meaning what the author wanted to convey.\n\nEver tried to read the Terms and Conditions in any agreement, I am sure you would want a simple one pager, but its not how the law works.'

"This was truly epic! We are even more 'English' than the 'English' themselves! :) :) :)"
'So sophisticated. Much verbose.'
'Not very correct, no. The author\'s comma usage is terrible, and introduce needs a matching to, but there isn\'t one.\n\nThe author is trying much too hard to sound educated, using the most obscure words and tortured phrasing they can come up with. The alliteration - "cancerous concoctions of corruption" - is ridiculous, so this is either parody or a high-school student with a thesaurus.\n\nIn slightly more normal English:\n\nPeople these days acknowledge that there is corruption everywhere, and appear to be resigned to it. Every day you can see it ingrained in society, completely out of control. Encouraged by the success of systemic corruption, the people behind it have increased their control over society. We must act both individually and together to free our society from this evil.'
'Sounds like something V from V For Vendetta would say.'
"Similar vocab has been used at times in Justice Lodha's judgements in BCCI case too. "
'Hmmm. Maybe if the judgements and other official statements could be in a simpler language, there would be less scope for misunderstandings. Also, it would appeal to the common public to read and understand it which I think is important for us to be aware of things like this. '
"Compare that with this quote from the US Supreme Court's judgement on gay marriage:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."
"Translation-\n\nPeople find that corruption has sunk into all aspects of life. Daily experiences confirm that it is there, digging away at the essence of the nation. Emboldened by the profits they recieved from bribery, the people who did this have kept a firm grip on society. We should all work together to get rid of this addiction to money.\n\n\nJesus fucking Christ Shakespeare wasn't this retardedly flowery."

'Thanks modi ji, I got 15 words for GRE'
"Needless outrage for the sake of it.  \n\nIf you don't understand it then maybe you should try harder to learn the language, given that English is supposed to be taught as a practical lingua franca in the country.  \n\nHaving a vast vocabulary is a good thing.  \n\nA judge is supposed to not write things in internet speak and if people feel that is not what is being suggested then there is already a subjective and arbitrary limit to what is supposed to happen and not.  \n\nNothing wrong with all this.

So you will at least get a notification if your card is used and if its not you, you can immediately block it.\r4) Use prepaid cards, estimate your monthly average spending based on your usage and make a prepaid card of that amount and use it.

Since we have free economy, reserve bank has to go with indirect measures. Like increasing the interest rates. Usually this works. But guess what? Real estate process keep increasing. Guess why?\n\nWhen every single property is purchased with only 50-70% black money(read: money reserve bank can do shit about), no owner gives a duck to interest rates. Yes, this happened. \n\nBecause my family member is an architect(gets paid by % of valuation), i got to know these things. Agreed, the poor are suffering, and they'll have to pay 1-2% extra. But think this: they are paying 50-70% extra as of right now. Because even politically neutral authority like RBI aren't able to control it, because cash is evil. Every single economist agrees cash is necessary evil, only existing because alternatives were worse.\n\nWe do have better alternatives now.

"You'll get more love on Facebook. "
'What swag !\n\nTotally love this !'
'Gets more like than Granpa in ACU.'
'Grannies are cool regardless of technology. '
'This is exactly how technology is enabling people to do things they never even imagined of doing before smartphones. And I love the change. '
'Hmm about that, my intention was not to whore karma. There are subreddits where you can whore thousand of karma points by just a little effort, or "reposts". This would be the last place I would come for that :('
'Oh yeah someone posted a couple of days ago. That egg dosa is giving me the glad eye. '
"If you follow things closely you'll see  India is actually getting cleaner. Not saying it's enough but it's the beginning of clean India. "
"The means with which you take a selfie and your purchasing power to acquire that mean is indicative of progress. \n\nProgress need not be mutually exclusive. So, we don't need to first - get shitless streets, second - get 100% literacy and so on. It is concurrent. And neither of the above two is going to ensure 'progress' of the people anyway. Living on shitless streets and having the ability to read and write does not give you 'progress'. Being able to read about whatever you want in the world through an internet connected phone is progress for me. "
'People who can use a smartphone to take selfies can also use it to educate themselves. Digital India is the easiest way to literacy.\n\nAlso, you can then send push notifications telling people not to shit on roads. Two birds with one stone, ez af.'
"> Progress need not be mutually exclusive. So, we don't need to first - get shitless streets, second - get 100% literacy and so on. It is concurrent\n\nI agree when you say progress is not mutually exclusive but progress is not a mobile phone or a Selfie either. Progress is when we start the concurrent process of \n\nEradication of defecation,\n\nPopulation Control,\n\nHealthcare,\n\n100% Literacy etc. Issues which are hindering India, which would lift the HDI (my go to metric to guage the progress of a nation) is progress to me, else we have tons of people posting their selfies while defecating on the fields, Would you call it progress?\n\n> Being able to read about whatever you want in the world through an internet connected phone is progress for me.\n\nWhat you are calling progress is just people catching upto technology. My mother is able to do video calling now, 15 years after the technology was in place. It is not progress, my mother just caught up to technology."
'Ha loda'
"The technology had not permeated across sections 15 years ago as it has now. This is progress. You miss my point. Progress is not taking selfies, it is having the purchasing power and the ability to take them. \n\nAlso, literacy is the ability to read and write. I've seen literate fools as much as illiterate path-breakers who employ thousands of such literate people. So, literacy is not the only or the major measure of progress.  "
'> The technology had not permeated across sections 15 years ago as it has now. This is progress. You kiss my point. Progress is not taking selfies, it is having the purchasing power and the ability to take them.\n\nI did not understand this. How is catching upto technology progress of the society? Individual development yes perhaps, but progress of the country? \n\nJio is selling 4G LTE phones now at 1500 bucks. Ability to purchase a smart phone at the price of a Nokia Asha(non smart phone) is not progress, It is market dynamics.\n\nPer Capita GDP is the metric to measure the [purchasing power](https://www.google.com/#q=india+gdp+per+capita&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgUeLQz9U3MC7KNtAyy0620s_JT04syczP0y8uAdLFJZnJiTnxRanpQCGr9JSC-Lz83Mw8oFBBalF8cmJBZkkiAIZwAfpEAAAA)\n\nIf you check It has not significantly changed since UPA 1 which was 2008. Where is the increase in purchasing power in the last decade?\n\nThis is why it is very important to study economics atleast till the 12th standard. Hence we need literacy and hence we would understand where we stand as a country in the road to development'
"Last few days I've been travelling a lot and I experienced this first hand myself (no uber) - especially where tolls are Rs. 50 or less.\n\nI paid in 2000 note and was just waived off!

"I do hope you have him a 1 star. \nTechnically it is difficult for uber to prove that he did not pay the toll. I can understand their reluctance to deduct the money. It clearly shows in their data the can passed through the toll.\n\nIf they would refund the money ,it means they are accounting for Indian jugaad/corruption. That's a bit far fetched, don't you think?\n\nBut yeah please 1 star the driver. It's a trade-off for him. ₹100 for 1 star :P"
'the driver saw the opportunity to make more money so he did it. and majority of Indians would have done the same.'

"even as an Indian I don't know what's happening. \n\nEDIT: I am assuming the Driver exchanged a real note for a counterfeit one at the toll booth.\n\nEDIT 2: Or it is that, since the toll booth is not going to give change in 100s (currently a precious comodity), he waived off the toll."
'You talking about our telangana or Andhra Pradesh. We are definitely khadoos. '

"Well. I've mostly been doing experiments with music and occasionally, memes about demonetization.

'Ohhhh. I thought Indian people had like mad respect for rich people or something.\n\nThis makes much more sense, thank you!'
'Only if it has the crescent as well'
"The dude who does Brown Paper Bag comic strips took off from here and posts once in a while. I'm sure the community won't mind India related contributions which don't reek of cheap promotion but more like sharing OC :)"
"Some more context. 2 months ago, the government demonetized all high-value currency notes (500 & 1000 rupees) as part of a drive to clean up black money, invalidate counterfeit notes, promote digital payments and well, at this point, pretty much whatever new fictitious benefit they make up on a daily basis. So it's been quite the crazy ride since there's an acute shortage of cash as you might imagine. They did however introduce a 2000 rupee note which, since there's no 500 or 1000 rupee note, is a ridiculously impractical denomination to make change for. Till very recently, tolls were waived to avoid traffic backing up, but the government now seems to believe that *all is fine* (because that's exactly the sort of delusion bureaucrats like to imagine from time to time) and tolls are back. So some smart drivers are trying to save a few bucks by telling the toll guy they have no denomination less than 2000. In many places, they've started accepting credit/debit cards but it hasn't covered all places quite yet"
"> indianmentality\n\nI'm not sure which class of Indians you are talking about. But as a Indian, and a salaried class tax paying one, I can tell you that no one mind small evasion of tax especially by people doing the menial jobs. Selling vegetables, driving taxi, small shopkeepers and people like those are just trying to earn some money to make a living. They're not building big houses, buying Jaguars or dining in five stars restaurants. They're just trying to make sure that their kids can have food to eat and can get a decent education.\nIt's the evasion of taxes by big businesses, builders, and other rich people which is disappointing.\n\nJust talk to some cab driver once, and ask about his family and how's he doing. Most of the times I've found that the most proud part of their life is being able to send their kids to a decent school."

"3 to 4.5 short tons (on average for females and male Asian elephants) vs. 160kg to 258kg (at most it seems for females and male Bengal tigers (which is what I assume is in the photo)). You do the math. \n\nOnly siberian tigers, which the heaviest unconfirmed was some 350kg, are brave enough to hunt black bears (which are still far lighter than grizzly, kodiak or polar bears). \n\nI don't think even a hippo would take on an Asian elephant despite weighing close to the same. "
'i too had seen my first tiger in wild at Jim Corbett. such a magnificent & badass creature a tiger is. there were about 10 jeeps at the safe distance from that tiger clicking photos but she was like..*I don\'t give a fuck*, she paid no heed to all those humans. i remembered the dialogue from Avatar while i was watching her, *"toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up?"*'
'The best time to visit Dudhwa National Park is between November and May.

'Nothing, the tiger went its way and the elephants, theirs. Tigers rarely attack elephants. '
'They have been brought to some parks in the hope of increasing the population.'
'Maybe after 50-100 years when our population is educated and knows their value '
'Something something allegory to how certain conglomerates profit from world chaos.'
"probability of seeing a tiger in Corbett is high in dry season, when the smaller streams of water are dried up. in that case there are a few places where the animals could go for water. and that is also the season of mating so tigresses travel huge distances daily to visit their mate's area and they follow a fixed path and the guides know those tracks very well."
"Tigers can, and do, survive on the plains of India pretty well.\n\nThese tigers vs lions debate are lame, but the tiger is easily the larger, stronger, and more agile of the two. Lions, however don't operate alone, so any serious confrontation of the two in the wild would definitely end bad for the tiger."

"That didn't answer that guy's question.\n\nI say this because I'm really interested in knowing if tigers have cooperated outside of sibling pairs."
">Bhai Gir Forest mein kya aasman se tapak kar aaye the lions?\n\nFrom your own source:\n\n >The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River\n\nAnd neither mention anything about tigers being a factor in the decline of Lion populations. On the contrary -\n\n>Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, **but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'**....Pocock said that it is **unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion,** rather, that man was responsible for it, as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers"

"> South's colonial hangover. That's why no rebellions came out of there.\n\nThere was no colonial hangover beacuse kerala was ruled throughout its history by it's own Kings. The guptas, mauryas, mughals and even the brits never established direct rule, our kings though small,  were smart enough to cut deals to ensure regional autonomy . The Kerala kingdoms were  2nd and 3rd tier Princely states (Hyd and Kashmir were tier 1). \n\nSo the anti british feeling were far less in Kerala , and our struggles were mostly against the caste segregation / zamindari system promoted by the Kings. \n\nAlso the south had its share of revolts too, especially in Madras presidency, but the british DID give access to large section of people to better education and less casteist segregation , so the british aren't seen as **all bad**  in the far south.

'>And that bird, assuming a golden body bright as the rays of the Sun, entered with great force (the region where the Soma was), like a torrent entering the ocean. And he saw, placed near the Soma, **a wheel of steel keen-edged, and sharp as the razor, revolving incessantly. And that fierce instrument, of the splendour of the blazing sun and of terrible form, had been devised by the gods for cutting in pieces all robbers**\n\n\n>of the Soma. Garuda, seeing a passage through it, stopped there for a moment. Diminishing his body, in an instant he passed through the spokes of that wheel. Within the line of the wheel, he beheld, stationed there for guarding the Soma two great snakes of the effulgence of blazing fire, with tongues bright as the lightning-flash, of great energy, with mouth emitting fire, with blazing eyes, containing poison, very terrible, always in anger, and of great activity. Their eyes were ceaselessly inflamed with rage and were also winkless. He who may be seen by even one of the two would instantly be reduced to ashes. The bird of fair feathers suddenly covered their eyes with dust. And unseen by them he attacked them from all sides. And the son of Vinata, that ranger of the skies, attacking their bodies, mangled them into pieces. He then approached the Soma without loss of time. Then the mighty son of Vinata, taking up the Amrita from the place where it was kept, rose on his wings with great speed, breaking into pieces the machine that had surrounded it. And the bird soon came out, taking the Amrita but without drinking it himself. And he then wended on his way without the least fatigue, darkening the splendour of the Sun.\n\n\nReminder: Ve invanted Mecha vs Kaiju.'

This whole spirit of Mumbai shenanigans diverts us all from the real issues plaguing the city."

'Think about this : After the 2005 floods, 1600 crores were given to install better drainage. The results are zilch. the sewers havent been cleaned or widened, the mithi river is still encroached upon, there are 5 pumping stations to drain the water of which none are working right now. '
'This has been the case since well before hashtags were a thing. I remember the spirit of Mumbai being invoked after the 1993 blasts. Even then it sounded stupid.'
"Here is the thing with the 'Spirit of Mumbai'. The term is coined by the media. However, the enthusiasm and the will to stand-by each other is often looked at as some sort of helplessness. To which I strongly disagree. \n\nNo one tells Mumbaikars to be nice to each other in times of distress, that is just the way the city functions. If people admire it and can make an example out of it, good. If not, I don't see a point in pissing on the ones who admire the goodness in this awfully busy city in which no one has time to even see each others face otherwise.\n\nI came home after 11 hours stuck in the traffic. I was very infuriated by the situation, not just of flooding but also of broken roads. I was tired and hungry. However, the good people living in and around Dadar started serving tea and biscuits in knee deep water. They were there in the rain serving strangers without asking anything in return. They were not members of any social organisation or NGO, they were just citizen. They could have stayed home. I heard that almost every temple, masjid and Gurudwara in the city were providing shelter, food and water and people were opening their doors to let strangers in. It's not like they are idiots or they don't know the risk, but they still did it. For me, that speaks volume for the so called 'Spirit of Mumbai'. \n\nOf course the city has an unplanned infra, the trains certainly broke down and people were stranded and guess what? Mumbai doesn't want the world to tell it that it's administration is responsible for it. It wouldn't be the financial capital which it is, if it did not know the ground reality. \n\nThe so called 'spirit of Mumbai' does not tell Mumbaikars to overlook the reasons that led us to the situation, it is the way the city copes with the situation at hand. Blaming the administration and finding a better replacement can be done after everyone has reached home safely."
"Reposting my comment from another thread.\n\n---\n\nFor the Mumbai residents or the citizens who are raging about now everywhere, why you did not go out to vote for your Municipal elections? The voter turnout for the local municipal elections in Mumbai [was a meager 55%](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/pix-civic-body-polls-mumbai-votes/20170221.htm) and that too was the highest in the last 25 years.\n\nThere is no doubt that the politicians who are in power should be questioned and mocked. But remember this, WE the citizens of this country have an equal responsibility as well. Besides voting, how many of us know our MP, MLA or Corporator? How many of us spend couple of hours every month - in our local associations or with our local representative to get things fixed? Yes the excuse that we don't have time or resources to follow up but let me tell you, its not difficult.\n\nThe problem is we like to enrage on social media these days but on the side ignoring our duties as well. I will repeat, I'm not against mocking or criticizing our politicians, whoever be it. But somehow we get our comforts by mocking and memeing our situations because we think we're entitled to services, as we paid taxes. We end up normalizing it, by doing this.\n\nBut remember this - our silence and our inability to perform our duties as a citizen, has time and again allowed politicians like these reign in power. If you think you're incapable to perform your duties, remember this - WE are the cream of the Indian internet. You shouldn't expect the remaining crowd to perform their duties too, wherein we dream of emigrating from this country.\n\nToday it is Shiv Sena, tommorrow BJP, after that Congress and again some other coalition. The truth is we're comfortable with them and have normalized their ineptness and our laziness as a citizen. In the process, we look for small freebies or appeal to our minority communities.\n\nNext time you go out to vote - Please do some research and vote for the BEST CANDIDATE in your region and NOT YOUR FAVOURITE POLITICAL PARTY. And keep asking them questions for the remaining five years.\n\nIf you don't vote, please don't complain and cry for the next five years. As a citizen you had a duty to vote and make your candidate accountable, which we regularly fail to do."
'Haha. Mumbaikars, pls vote better next time.'
'Yeah in the end MUMBAI WINS over rains'
'This is true on so many levels!'
"So perfect. Only one thing to be added, it isn't just shitty infrastructure, there's also incompetent civic administration which results in zero fucks given about managing disasters before they happen. \n\nNot poetic like OP's post, but true nonetheless. :)"
"Eh. You guys act too American. Most Indian metros have shitty roads that fuck up more because of the rain. And dengue and malaria are there EVERYWHERE. It's not a city only problem, it's a nationwide problem. You should see the crap they do in bangalore for ganesh chathurthi\n\nOn a positive note: Best maintained roads in India: Bhubhaneswar and Chennai. (As far as I have seen) "
'Ha ha... apni Dilli hi sahi hai bhai.'
"Well if Mumbai was well prepared like massive overhaul of storm drains, regular maintenance of these drains was done and a calamity hits; yes the spirit is what is required to survive and recover. Cannot go to war with a knife attached to a crooked spear. Many of indian cities are in the same state, incl blr. These politicians are too crooked, i don't think they remotely care about anything other than their power and money. "
"Pretty much every single community has this exact same spirit. It's not unique and Mumbai is not special and these idiots need to realise that this attitude allows the governments to get away with anything."
"And how when there's heavy rains. MET dept predicts heavy rainfall for next 24 hours and it hardly rains.\nAnd the maha CM announces holiday the next moment. "
'http://www.theweek.in/columns/shashi-tharoor/beware-the-perils-of-fatalism.html\n\n"It speaks of what the Orientalists saw as Indian fatalism, our self-absorption in the face of impossible circumstances, and our willingness to make the best we can out of those circumstances.\n\nThat is the Indian answer to the insuperable difficulty. One does not fight against that which one cannot overcome, but seeks instead to find the best way, for oneself, to live with it."'
'Haha so fking true bc '
"Non-mumbaiker here, not a single year goes by when I don't give a fuck about the situation which is caused due to the rains. How can people survive this shit years after years and not revolt? If it would have been delhi or any other inside city, it's understandable provided we are still a third world country. You people fucking live right next to the ocean. BMC is okay with this, they know it's a few days of work. They'll be back to stuffing their pockets or threatening a TV guy, but you my friend live there. "
"Not to mention everything is expensive including most importantly, restaurant food. There is no Mumbai equivalent of a 75-Rupees Chicken Biryani or 50-Rupees Paratha-Bhaji that does not taste like cardboard fit to serve only in Tihar Jail.\n\nThe only food items you get for less than 25 Rupees are Vada Pav, Samosa Pav, Bhajiya Pav and other deep friend poison. Even Idli/Dosa/Mendu Vada costs upwards of 30 Rupees a plate.\n\nFor a guy who wants to keep his food budget within 3000 Rupees a month AND cannot cook home food (don't have the time, thanks Baniya boss and Mumbai Traffic), its simply impossible.\n\nAnd as I pay upwards of 10,000 Rupees a month for rent (thanks Mumbai, again), I have to keep my food costs down BUT in Mumbai only Jail Food is available at that price (or I have to take the time and effort to cook my own)."
'People live as worms in Mumbai. Unless you are in the top 2% (Both House and Office in SoBo, preferably a Rich Lawyer or a Class-I Govt Officer, chauffeur driven car, earning more than 60-70 LPA) it is very difficult even for an Upper-middle class guy to live with Dignity in Mumbai. \n\n'

"Born and brought up, now an exMumbai-ite.\nThe year long humidity, filth, crowds, traffic jams, pollution, the anxiety of travelling by rails or roads, unjustifiably-astronomically-skyhigh property prices, and yes the rain gods getting over enthused once in every ten years.\nI feel like punching people in the face when they claim Mumbai's the best city when they've never given any other city a fair chance, even in India. I agree with the silver lining though, safer than many other cities. The auto-rickshaws, no matter how much we cuss them, still go by the meter, not in any other city that I know of.\n"
'Delhi has better food'
'My problem with #SpiritOfMumbai is that all cities are the same. If something like this happened in any other major city, people would show up for work the next day just like people in Mumbai do. \n\nInstead of realising that, this entire thing becomes a circle jerk where people congratulate each other over how they were good human beings instead of holding the people who were responsible for spending our tax money accountable.'
'>  Blaming the administration and finding a better replacement can be done after everyone has reached home safely\n\nAnd this has not happened for all these years because.. ?\n\nMumbaikars are really great for supporting each other. But they should take an objective looks at their leaders and question them about why they failed them regarding infrastructure.'
"Finally some sane voice.\n\nMost of those commenting seem to be from outside Mumbai. They do not understand what Spirit of Mumbai actually means. It definitely does not mean that Mumbaikars have overlooked administrative inefficiency. Infact,I think Mumbaikars are quiet vocal about anything wrong that happens in Mumbai. Often we find issues in Mumbai (& Delhi) trending at national level.\n\nTo simplify ,Spirit of Mumbai denotes how Mumbaikars keep happy face & willingness to help in the face of chaos & calamity. When flood has reached your doorstep,its time to tackle issue at hand & not get into 'whos-in-power-&-how-it-happened' bullshit. That can be looked into later  when the storm has subsided.\n\n**TLDR : Right now we are in the middle of grave situation ,it is only 'Spirit Of Mumbai' thing which can make things efficient & not grumpy rants of 'who-controls-bmc-?'**\n\nAlso,fuck Shiv Sena :("

"You bet these are all worthy of being appreciated! It was such a minuscule probability to simply be born, as a human being, on Earth (during a relativity hospitable stage of its life!), in a free country, in a family that wanted us, raised us, educated us....! \r\rYet here we are.\r\rI absolutely agree that leading our life by *always* comparing it with other peoples lives is not a good way. One should never actively seek those less fortunate in order to feel good about themselves- However, if one happens to encounter a person less fortunate, and that makes them realize that they shouldn't complain or feel bad about their own petty troubles or 'first world' problems'; then that's a way more healthy and mature reaction to the encounter than simply ignoring it and moving on with life.\r\r\r"

"I wish everyone adopted stray dogs. They are so pure, we don't deserve them."
'I agree strays are the best, not only are they loyal but they have adapted to indian conditions.'
"But muh **insert le expensive breed of dog* * \n\nIn all seriousness these local dogs have adapted well to the Indian environment while many of these exotic breeds aren't and thus suffer a lot, so please do your research if you really care about the dog and not getting it just for a showpiece! "
"We have a kind of a road, where on both the sides are just houses and Ganesha Idols in the making. But the conditions they live in are pathetic af. It literally stinks when I pass through that road everyday for college.

'Leaving a non-pedigree dog without a collar is an invitation to somebody kicking it or throwing a rock at it. People think twice when they see a clean dog with a collar.'
"People who've never had a pet dog can probably not understand how innocent they are. They make the humans around them better human beings."
'A few cities have laws which bans sale of dogs via pet store etc. You can only adopt pets, such schemes will help to curb some issues of strays and more importantly people buying foreign breeds of dogs not suitable for India like huskies or poodles or rottweilers. '
'But if you adopted 1 and trained it properly it wont attack anyone. '

'People should start loving other people above all else, before thinking of loving animals.'
"Sure, you'll love the food of Ahmedabad, being a foodie city. plus as a World Heritage City now, you'll be exploring several official World Heritage places across different religions, and historical landmarks."
"I can't think of a single reason why. If you said love other people AND animals, then I would agree. But why other people before animals?"
"In an ideal world, I'd say people and animals. But in a country like ours, not possible. Stray dogs have been attacking people in many cases and if the solution is to put them down, there is no need to think twice. Modern nations don't have stray animals in public places. They are taken care of by bodies in place for such purposes. \n\nIf you are equating humans with animals, then you could marry a dog or have a dog instead of a child. I am all for valuing lives equally but this is just ridiculous. If you love them so much, please adopt them and keep them away from the streets. "

"Ahahahah ! So much for speaking the truth. Try expressing your opinions to the public and you get downvoted. \n\nYou're right ! Even if you get a 1000 downvotes, you are ! "
"People might make fun of Linkin Park's lyrics these days, but to someone in that mind state it really speaks to them, it helps them relieve themselves from those feelings. "
"Dude songs are a form of expressing emotions. There are a lot of people who identify with these kind of lyrics and just listening to these songs can be comforting when you're going through a rough phase."
"Man, I don't even like Linkin Park and I still have the good grace not to spit out bullshit platitudes like that. I hope you reach that precipice some day if only because it might expand your tiny worldview."
"I don't really get this joke. Can you explain?"
"True I agree it's expressing emotions but is that the only emotion a band can express? All the bands songs are -ve: Just look at the lyrics of any song from their recent album. "
"Thank you. :')"
"Nope. I just listen to the songs and that's it. I know of better people to read of"
"I haven't heard their recent work but it might be a concept album if most of the songs revolve around one topic, which is perfectly fine even if the lyrics are dark. Like I said, it doesn't have to appeal to everyone."
"I was surprised that this friend of mine, 2 years behind me, didn't know this Prince :("

In those many decades, this has turned out to be the real power which moves the world.\n\nDemocracy is very hard to control when the media is forced to fight over eyeballs.\n\nThe media industry faces intense competition - so they too resort to the methods that help them win advertizing time and space.\n\nAnyway, theres way too much stuff to be discussed in this.'

You can use classmate or whatever.\n\nHowever, in the "non-core" subjects like Compter Science, there used to be a specific text-book, authored by the teachers themselves. You would be forced to buy it.

'I will fondly remember him for his role in Hera Pheri as "Oye Ganshaam!"'
"Ardh Satya is one of my all time favorite films in this world. I saw it in the first year of college and it's beauty stunned me. \n\nHere is my (poorly done) rendition of the original ardh Satya poem by Marathi poet Dilip Chitre: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/enviaofyore/ardh-satya-envia-feat-dilip-chitre\n\nCouple of other poems that appear in the film, recited by Om Puri himself in this lovely scene where he grabs Smita Patil's book of poems and reads them. He's trying to flirt with her, but then something happens. You can feel his tone change midway, as if suddenly he felt things that he had long tried not to face. Aaah, my heart feels like it's breaking :( what a sad day my friends...\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/enviaofyore/dilip-chitre_kriti-ke-pehle\n\nHere is the original Ardh Satya poem in his own voice - \nhttps://soundcloud.com/enviaofyore/dilip-chitre_ardh-satya\n\nYou can download these tracks if you like. "
'His debut was in Ghashiram Kotwal, role in Ardha Satya was fantastic. Not to mention that he was one of the mainstays of parallel cinema in India, kudos to him, rip'
"I was watching Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Om Puri's 5 minute cameo came. Immediately after that scene i jokingly told my friend 'Boss Man of the match toh movie ka Om Puri Hai'.     \n       \nThis is just an example. His roles in Ardh Satya (powerful), Gupt, Ghayal, Hera Pheri (still makes me laugh), Maachis, Gandhi (remember that scene), Chachi 420 (arguably his best for me), Maachis, Malamal Weekly, East is East etc have been outstanding. RIP Sir. "
'one of the best actors of Bollywood. Amazing voice and dialogue delivery.  RIP'
'Wow. This is a great loss for the film industry. Truly one of the greatest.'
"I cannot forget Om Puri reciting Dilip Chitre's poem out in the Movie Ardh Satya\n\nचक्रव्यूह मे घुसने से पहले\nकौन था मैं और कैसा था\nयह मुझे याद ही ना रहेगा\n\nचक्रव्यूह मे घुसने के बाद\nमेरे और चक्रव्यूह के बीच\nसिर्फ़ एक जानलेवा निकटता थी\nइसका मुझे पता ही न चलेगा\n\nचक्रव्यूह से निकलने के बाद\nमैं मुक्त हो जाऊँ भले ही\nफ़िर भी चक्रव्यूह की रचना मे\nफर्क ही ना पड़ेगा\n\nमरुँ या मारू\nमारा जाऊं या जान से मार दूँ\nइसका फ़ैसला कभी ना हो पायेगा\n\nसोया हुआ आदमी जब\nनींद से उठ कर चलना शुरू करता हैं\nतब सपनों का संसार उसे\nदुबारा दिख ही नही पायेगा\n\nउस रौशनी में जो निर्णय की रौशनी हैं\nसब कुछ समान होगा क्या?\n\nएक पलडे में नपुंसकता\nएक पलडे में पौरुष\nऔर ठीक तराजू के कांटे पर\nअर्ध सत्य\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnGqykOmT50"
'Brilliant actor. genuine human. My favourite were the voice overs he did for discovery of India.  He was heart broken towards the end. with the divorce from his wife and his run ins with the right winger trolls where he later had to apologize for expressinig his opinons. \n\nRIP'
'What a loss, one of best we will ever come across...'
'One of the greatest actors and my favourite.\nMay his soul rest in peace.'
"RIP Om Puri sir.\n\nThe remarkable thing about this actor was that he sort of synced with the character like no one else could - be it the role of Khadak Singh in Hera Pheri, or the role of a top extremist in Kurbaan, he did his job perfectly! Pretty much like his ~~brother~~ surname-sake Amrish Puri who also used to perform all varieties of roles.\n\n**edit**\n\nTIL that Amrish Puri and Om Puri weren't actually brothers, don't know how that rumor spread!"
'RIP. Great loss..'

'एक पलडे में नपुंसकता\nएक पलडे में पौरुष\nऔर ठीक तराजू के कांटे पर\nअर्ध सत्य\n\n\nPerfect summary of his character in the beautiful Ardh Satya. One of the finest actors India has ever produced. '
'RIP SIR \n\nI had difference with his politics but he was indeed one of the greatest acting talent India produced.'
'Very talented and versatile actor. Thoughts and prayers to his family and friends. '
'Loved him in East is East, brilliant movie :( RIP'
'RIP. Om Puri was one of the greatest Actor in Indian Cinema.'
'Weirdly the first role I ever seen him in was The Ghost and The Darkness. Thought he was awesome in that and saw him in Pukar soon after. An awesome actor, a force to be reckoned with. '
'A few months back, we were having food at this small eatery in Worli. Moments later, Om Puri quietly walked in, had a cup of coffee, and posed for a pic with one couple who were so excited and left. He seemed so humble for a person of his stature. Rest in Peace'
'I know people have highlighted his best roles, but for me one of the first time I appreciated him was his role in Gandhi. \n\nBarely 5 minutes a role, he plays one of the Calcutta rioters who confronts Gandhi. \n\nIt was a short but such a poignant and memorable role. '
'Forget acting skills, his views against Hindutvawadis and India is what won him many fans... True Pro FoS spirit.'
'He was an awesome actor.'
'Good actor'
'RIP om puri.always admired his versatility. one of the few celebrities I saw in person in Mumbai airport where he was entering the gates.'
'Great acting in Singh is King.. I crack every time.... :)(\n'
'I loved his role in Maachis and Jaane bhi do yaaro. \n\n"Hellooo Mr. D\'Mellooo" '
'He is not only a veteran actor in the Indian subcontinent, but also made India visible in many international movies. He is well-respected all over the world and makes India proud.\n\nAlthough there are a few fuckwits on the internet saying things like, "I would rather support the army", "Pakistan supporter" and "Now he can personally meet the soldiers", most of the reaction is positive with everyone remembering him fondly.\n\nI\'m glad that a man with such an enormous history of realistic roles behind him, breaking barriers of beauty-standards of his time, and cross-cultural cinema, wasn\'t overshadowed by angry rants of a journalist half-his age and yesterday-born pseudo-"patriots". '
'In the spirit of "shaming indian male sexuality", we should celebrate India getting rid of a horny old pervert'
"RIP to an the most amazing veteran actor who could fit in any role you give him.Fortunate enough to see his movies back in the '80s when movies were really movies and not some commercial crap.\n\nThe only channel which was a huge pile of shit was Times Now who didn't even make a single headline about that veteran actors death.Politics aside,he was a Padmashree and National Award winner.And he deserved at least some kinds words about the departed soul.Really Dick head move.Sick."
'Om means peace.  '
'Man, we lost a great fella today. Great actor, really humble (took a flight with him once, and he kept the wife and I entertained for 2 hours), fantastic sense of humor. God damn you, 2017.'

'Sad news. great actor. But dude went out batting for kashmiris and muslims. Did he actually convert?'

'To implement swacch bharat abhiyaan, it would have been a great measure if the attendants were asked to clean up after the concert. A sudden announcement, just like the Demonitization one. '
"Just Indian being Indians.. nothing to see. the very word clean and hygiene doesn't exist in Indians people mind.\n\nIndians and Filth go together all the time."
'I find this affluent shit a bit hypocricital and self serving - \nThe EIC guys during their performance were happy to point out that the vast majority of people who were there were not from the affluent section, and thus their actual audience. \n\nThe fact that most of the tickets were given out free, pretty much nails this title as the posters bias. And its a cop out - \n\nCleaniness has nothing to do with\n\n1) Affluent people\n\n2) Educated people\n\n3) Poor people\n\n4) Un-educated people\n\n\nWhen its about normal habits, clean up and enforcement of rules. \n\nManufacturing outrage is bullshit.'
"I mean, there's always this much trash after concerts. I've been to Music Midtown in Atlanta and there was this much trash afterwards and usually the park where it was held is super clean.\n\nIt happens everywhere because it's so hard to have enough trashcans equally spaced when so many people pack together in that kind of a space.\n\nWe definitely have a littering problem, but I don't think a concert location a few hours after the concert should be our yardstick. How clean an average street is on the average day should be what we look at.\n\nedit: Hell, I organised an event for ~200 people on campus and they made us put up at least 20 more big trashcans everywhere on top of the trashcans that are permanently placed in that area. Make it easier and more convenient to be clean and people will start being clean"
'Remember these people are most privileged in india. this is just very common even among the privileged top 1-5% Indians\n\nIndia = Shithole because Indians = humanities worst beings (sub human behaviour)'
'\nCleanliness in India needs to be privatized and paid for by using all the black money tax that is now being recovered . Have private cleanliness firms like Waste Management here in the US compete for city-specific tenders paid for by the govt . \n\nCops should be given bonuses for giving out penalty tickets to people who litter and if cops take bribes for that at least it will be for a good cause and that will be an incentive for them to catch more people littering '
'OP get real here. No one cares about such pledges. '
"I'm going to try and  discuss possible ways to solve this problem.\n\n1.  Whenever I see trash on the street, I'll pick it up and throw it in the next trash can I see.\n\n2.  Buy and place trash cans in my small neighborhood and speak with my society to have garbage guy pick it up. It's time to make the Diwali bakshish count.\n\n\nI want to live every ideal I was taught as a kid and be as optimistic about our future as I can."
"I am inclined to agree. Our organisers are the kind of people who don't think about related stuff. Like 80000 people.. Where do they pee, throw garbage, park their vehicles etc,fire safety, medical care. All that is an afterthought. (probably the same kind of people who build our homes where apart from how big each house is and how much money it can sell for, everything else is an afterthought)\n\n Stuff like this makes me appreciate western countries because these afterthoughts are mandatory and imposed by law to be adequately taken care of.\n\nTo be fair to Indians, we do clean up after ganapati visarjan (though after years of hue and cry) and I've been to places with adequate waste management and when provided, we do use it. \n\nI think the middle class and up do have a problem with littering and the poorer class have the added problem of spitting everywhere"
'I agree. I hardly saw any litter box around there and I remember when my friend saw the huge pile of bottles and cans at one corner and pointed out how ironic that is.'
'Its a security measure. There has been a history of bombs being planted in garbage bins across the world including India ([#1](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/After-2009-blasts-dustbins-a-casualty/articleshow/44787152.cms), [#2](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Surat-Man-finds-bomb-in-dustbin-carries-it-to-police-station/articleshow/3303673.cms), [#3](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/low-intensity-bomb-explodes-in-jamshedpur-no-damage-reported/story-KI9wUpw6FSUATqN9Mt6NXO.html), [#4](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/blast-in-meghalayas-east-jaintia-hills-bomb-was-placed-in-dustbin_1849444.html)). So in events which attract large crowds, it is not preferable to have too many garbage bins. Some have suggested transparent dustbins so that any suspicious item can be easily recognised. \n\nEdit: I also think lack of dustbins is not good enough reason to litter. You should either create less/no garbage or carry what you create to the nearest bin'

"I'ld say you were being very bold . "
"NRI here. I've been coming to India since 1992 sporadically and it's like watching 30 years go by in development every 4 or 5 years. Mostly Delhi and Punjab. \n\nThe trash went from appropriate given the surroundings to anarchronistic. It feels like everything else is a temporary movie set. "
"Have you ever been to a rock/metal concert?\nThe kind of filth you'll see there would change your entire perspective towards what constitutes as that.\n\nNot defending this negligence,just that an adrenaline fueled party night isn't going to be among the most clean sober places."

'What about you? Does the very word clean and hygiene  exist in your mind?'
"And you would think there would be large pool of workers available to do the job, but there aren't any workers available to clean up after other people. It's is a big challenge "
'Right but the workers job should be to clean the dustbins and not pick litter from the ground.'
'good spot.'
'You have nice choice.'
'What makes you better? How much empathy you possessed for fellow citizens , i can assure you being less human aka another shitthole '
'Good read. But I am not sure how does it connect to the trash in a cold play concert? Serious, not being sarcastic. '
'Balls.\n\nThis event was organized very well. Water was free, and being handed out constantly - there were repeated addresses by the compete to ensure that people drank.\n\nThe rubbish was collected in my section, repeatedly.'
"\n>I thought we learned to get over this shitty attitude with Satyamev Jayate. There's nothing 'Indian' about India's problems, except the relative difficulty in implementation because of all the diversity. They are systematic problems which have been solved by nations easily but are romanticized as things that make us 'Indian'.  \n\nIndians require to be literally caned. Only then would they not drop shit like this on the streets while simultaneously liking 'save the world' pages on Facebook. Remember how Singapore caned that US kid for littering the streets, despite having a request for being pardoned by Clinton? We need the same caning. Not kids, but the adults themselves."
'Was alcohol allowed at this event? If yes, this is standard fare.'
"If the person is going to be filthy, they'll go to any lengths to justify their behaviour. \n\nIf they care about cleanliness, they'll do so regardless of the scenario. "

"Good news for college and uni students who can't afford books by foreign publication houses at exorbitant prices and don't even have a low price edition for India. "
"Great news!\n\nWhat we must realise about text books is that they're written by academics whose research work is generally subsidised by the state - in India, at least. So, the state has some right to create these laws. Private companies cannot monopolise what is to a large extent public funded research.\n\nAs someone in academia, I personally am very conscious of this. The public finances us and we have to pay back - we are public servants."

'Does this mean that a scanned PDF of a photocopied textbook is also fair use?'
'Win .'
"The solution to expensive textbooks are cheaper textbooks. Photocopying of copyrighted textbooks is theft of intellectual property. But as usual the courts take the populist route. That's why in India inside incentive for original content is completely absent. Piracy is state sanctioned essentially. "
'No surprises. We are a country of thieves. I am sure 99% of Indians will love laws like these.'
"I am of the opinion that materials you need for academic research should be free or at least be made available by the institutes for free considering the academicians get paid in peanuts for their job. Charging $50 for a published paper in a journal is especially ethically and morally wrong. Robbery in broad daylight if I might add since the authors don't get paid for the publication. \n\nThis is why all the recent theoretical physics and mathematics papers are made available for free on project euclid and arxiv and it's completely legal.\n\n\nAlso a PSA for the researchers: you can download almost any paper illegally on [scihub](https://moscow.sci-hub.ac/). "
'Thank you, @samacharbot2.'
'The courts aren\'t sanctioning piracy. It\'s a clear message, which actually is sensible:\n\n>And clarified that while educational photocopying is permissible, there are limits to this as well. And that any copying must comport closely with the intended purpose ("in the course of instruction"). In that sense, publishers have made some gains in at least ensuring that a complete free for all regime is not what is intended by the law. But a circumspect one, where the copying has to fall within the bounds of the educational exception.\n\n Most publishers have a copyright clause that allows "intended purpose" copying, for class and teaching purposes. So while this doesn\'t necessarily prevent piracy, the spirit of the law has a very good intent keeping the students in mind. Supporting publishing houses with a very rigid interpretation of the copyright law is not good for the public overall, and not good for the education system. This ruling can help achieve a couple of things: first, publishers will be more careful bullying academicians with copyright violation bullshit, and secondly, they will consider lowering their exorbitant prices and learn to understand and treat the Indian market differently to how they treat the West. '
'Have you ever seen the gulf in quality between local textbooks (that are cheap) and foreign textbooks (that are expensive)? Not applying this to all local textbooks, quite a few of them are genuinely good, but in general, they are worse in terms of quality. They have typos, erratic grammar and QnA that are only rote-learning based. Essentially they are written to help you pass an exam (which is fine) but if you want to actually understand concepts properly, you have to refer to those expensive textbooks. '
'100%\n\nKnowledge should be free. '
"I fully agree it's theft. However, \n\nUSA started protecting copyrights/IPR etc only after they stood to lose more than they gained. \n\nWhen Charles Dickens visited the US, he saw that locally printed copies of his books were sold all over the place. And he got nothing from that. Printing foreign books was what kick started and primed the American Printing industry. They started putting laws around piracy & enforcing them only after they had a lot of local authors to protect. Dickens, in fact, said that if American Publishers had paid Walter Scott royalties, Scott won't have died being broken by bankruptcy.   \n\nThis is how most countries behaved till recently."
"The publishing companies there have a huge monopoly on textbooks. The costs are prohibitively expensive ($50-$100 per book, some courses required 2-3 textbooks, and a professor wouldn't even use 1 of them) \n\nWhen I was there indian students specially used to photocopy books en masse, then there were some books you could get indian editions for, so we bought them here and took them with us. You could also purchase a used textbook on amazon.\n\nTo get around the piracy issue publishing companies have authors revise editions of their textbooks every 3-4 years, the revisions generally involve minute things like changing a line here or there, or changing the numbers in a problem. Students would still not buy the books and just get a copy of the latest problemsheet, as the rest of the text was identical.\n\nSo recently some textbooks started coming with a unique code, and some professors started having students submit their homeworks online using that code to ensure everyone had purchased a new textbook."
'I am not versed to explain how in its entirety as there are many factors.  However I do believe the root of the problem stems from emphasis on monetization of education instead of the proliferation of education. I wish to explore the topic of textbooks as I believe that in my country the system around textbook publication is a contributing factor in the erosion of quality education.\n\nAccess to the texts are not usually an issue.  The manner in which they are published is where the issue arises.  In a majority of the classes I enrolled in the professors will choose books published within 2 years prior.  The university\'s book store sets the prices of books at an inflated rate.  Perhaps there are incentives the textbook companies will offer the schools if the universities choose to use the newest book?  When I am able I buy books from amazon or another store in town to save money.  There have been times where I buy one book that is more expensive than the list of books for my remaining classes!\n\nIt is not always the case that books are expensive, just that it is more common in my experience.  I always would ask the professor if I can use the previous edition of a book instead of the newest published edition.  Some professors will acknowledge that the differences between the 8th edition and 9 edition are minimal other than a 100% price increase. While other professors are adamant that "latest & greatest" textbook must be used.  In my personal experience I found American born teachers were less willing to compromise.  I was met with relief when my professors from Russia, China, and Taiwan allowed the use of older texts.  The manner in which they spoke the English language prevented me from recognizing every word but their method of teaching could be understood perfectly.\n\nThe passing down of knowledge and the desire to create a more intelligent world should be driving education NOT money.'
"Text books , for same engineering course per semester, will easily cost you more than 1200$(around 1 lakh) if you buy every single book like in India.\nGoogle tried to open source evry book by making a digital copy but failed.\nLuckily libraries are heavily stocked but still you can't find your favourite book when needed."
'> or at least be made available by the institutes for free considering the academicians get paid in peanuts for their job.\n\nNot only that. A lot of times, the research itself is funded by government or other public organizations. Yet, access to the research is pay-walled. It reminds me of how Aaron Swartz was pursued in the US.'
"I'm really grateful to my college and government for providing free books which are prescribed in the course to the students."
"Most credible papers are available on the authors' web pages.  \nWhen they are not, assume something is sketchy and move on.  \nThis is true for most STEM fields, not sure about others."
'The different one cost 701. So yeah.  '
'Again you are reiterating the argument something is useful, hence it must be cheap. That kind of mentality has caused this country to be the shit show that it is.'
"Well as usual users on r/india are sympathetic to what serves their interest rather than think of the legitimacy of an issue. Essentially the argument you are making is local books suck, foreign ones are well written but expensive. Hence let's disregard copyright laws. This kind of self serving mentiality is why this country will never progress.\n\n**Etc**: An addition from another reply which is pertinent to my argument.\n\nTo be clear, it isn't that cheap education and healthcare aren't desirable. The question is how can we achieve that.\nThose of here believe, like millions of other sheep around the world, that somehow you can have a free lunch, that you can jerry-rig a system into being falsely cheap. Humans have tried this system, and it is called socialism. And history is replete with example of when you thwart the market through deplorable acts such as this, you cause long term ruin. Of course, this is hard for people to get as they are concerned only about things that serve their immediate interest. That I can empathize with.\n\nLet me point you to Milton Friedman's [**famous talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmqoCHR14n8) about this. There are two great evils in this world. One is monopoly, which is evident to most. The second is state sanctioned means of forcing the market to twist out of shape. But let's disregard all that. Maybe your uncle in Delhi is right in rejoicing far 'cheaper' water and electricity. After all they are desirable things. \n\nTo be sure, whole photocopying of textbooks is treated as outright copyright infringement across the world. **The important point is this:** by allowing that in India, we have tacitly implied that the value of any book is no more than the cost of producing the pages and printing ink on it."
'You surely must be aware its almost an epidemic of massively overpriced textbooks in US?\n\nAnd from an ethical standpoint it has been argued that knowledge should be shared and not kept confined to a limited set of consumers?\n\n'
'Well, clearly not 100%. Not all of us are thieves.'
'Yes it is.'
'That\'s pretty much the USA\'s approach to capitalism anywhere. It will work only when they can disproportionately benefit from it. There have been many similar claims raised when they tried to "copyright" basmati rice through biotechnology. Aside from that, the evergreening claims for various medicines also are well known. '
"What? Doesn't your University has a library? My University has about 8-10 copies of all the recommended textbooks in the syllabus. And the Uni rents them for 6 months. At the beginning of the semester, we just borrow the books and rotate them around. I only bought the books that I thought was good reference and will need after I graduate."
'When everything is run by the rules of capitalism & profit motive, this is what happens.'
'>having students submit their homeworks online using that code to ensure everyone had purchased a new textbook.\n\nWTF, for real? '

"We will slowly get around that problem. Remember when the big media houses were the only one controlling the narrative. Now, anyone with a camera and YouTube account can produce a video.

"That's not exactly  how it works though. A research group typically have to write an eloborate proposal to a government agency like NSF or DARPA and have to win funding.  The funding is only limited to research activities and paying Research team.  While publishing papers are an important part of academic research, many research  , funded by DARPA or corporate sponsors, typically have Non disclosure clauses.\n\nBecause of these IP rights, many PhD students usually rewrite their papers  without revealing the prohibitive stuff.\n\n Coming to your main argument, all the  high impact journals have to employ many background staff even before the commencement of the anonymous review. It is generally  a thankless job and majority of the good journals struggle to break even without the subscription fee from the academic institutions.\n\n Keep in mind , various indexes like Scopus, science direct are just aggregators of journals not the journals themselves. They are not responsible for the peer review and don't receive any funding from the either academic institutions or government. They too really really need money from subscriptions for staying afloat.  \n\nThere are also Indian, Korean,  Chinese predatory publishers who even require money for their 'peer review'. They are the ones who are in this business for money and they tend to publish anything , literally anything , without even a single comment or review.  \n\n\ntl dr : good academic publishing is not a profitable business and publishers are well within their rights to require a subscription fee. \n\n\n\n"

Most people have no idea how much sounder you sleep when your mind doesn't punish you by replaying events/things that you don't have. I hope you keep her away from all social media except for twitter, which really helps in learning new things and grow your brain with interactions that are entirely in text (for the most part). Don't mean to sound condescending but most Twitter interactions help you pick up wordplay and is healthy fun minus the showing off and sharing of stuff that no one's interested about. Also ask her to check out youtube where she can interact with like minded people who have same interests, say cooking for example. Really helps in connecting with people with a wholesome purpose - sharing information."

"Sadly after becoming Sczophrenic she's not the same she used to be. Initially after all that things, she blamed us for that day when we forced her to go to a doctor, putting her on meds.. she blamed all things on us. After taking meds for almost two months with no willing to visit a doctor she stopped taking the meds. After some days of downtime she became more active. Going to college, doing creative things like painting, quilling which she always loved. She has always been a topper in all things except technical things and life. \n\nNow she's\u200b smiling sometimes for no reasons, the voices is making her sick. Still she don't wanna go to a doctor. I have told her what her decease is, and provided all helps to get better but she's not willing to take it. \n\nStill better that instead of lying on bed all the time she's doing something. Which is one way to overcome this decease. I'm still not sure that she's Schzophrenic. \n\nOne good thing is she seemed to be forgiven us, and showing all the signs of love for mom. Which is good. By saying she's not the same, yes she has changed. Increased bhakti for gods, teachers, people, monday fasting for shiva. Unusual thoughts like she told us that she wants to buy a car. Becoming more vegetarian by stopping onion and lasun, and may more things. \n\nLife's been crazy for the last couple of months, hope the dawn is just over. Thanks everyone for helping me out on that day. I can never get bored of thanking you guys over and over again. :)\n\nalso thanks for your tips, I'll definitely look em up and show them to her."
"Yes she does. She makes ornament, jewelry, small creatures like birds, toys. Someday I'll share them. :)"
"Still whatever you make, you'll only get better from time to time. So if you are interested then start doing so. Start with quilling, it's easy. \n\n"
"> sometimes smiling for no reason\n\nThat may be because Schizophrenic Indians generally have benevolent voices, while in the west schizophrenics have almost always reported malevolent and hateful auditory hallucinations. Maybe that's why your sis doesn't want to take her meds, because her voices may be benevolent. You should ask her about this. \n\nSource: http://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/"

"> I have tried hooking her up with some great shows such as friends, Breaking Bad, Better call Saul and more but all failed.\n\nThese are shows on which one needs to be invested in, for seasons on end.\n\nHere's one way to get her to understand that something really amazing (and sometimes very much rewarding than movies) can come out of TV. Ask her to watch this particular episode of Black Mirror (each episode in the series is a one-off thing, not connected to each other). The episode is titled 'San Junipero'. [Here](https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/16082535/Black.Mirror.S03E04.720p.WEBRip.x264-SKGTV[ettv])'s a well seeded torrent.

Well fingers crossed man, hope she accepts her medication. Some of the side effects can be ugly... Also, keep an eagle eye on those nasty relatives who turn up and make disgusting comments on mental illness, and given her age there will be some odd questions on her marriageability. Typical desi shitfest. Just show that you will be there for her, no pressure. As long as it takes for her to get better. \n\nYou are good people. "
"She isn't young though, mid twenties. Doctor said she needs to be on meds. Otherwise she won't get up from bed. \n\nSchzophrenia isn't rare, it's pretty common in young ages and mid twenties in women. My one advice to all people. Don't take stress or heavy pressure on your head, take it easy. Talk with people instead of keeping them inside you.\n\nThanks for your well wishes.  :)\n"

'Man. Manki bath is the only original scheme under Mudiji.'
'Remember, the only true original invention of Modi has been Demonetisation. That\'s the reality that the BJP brigade don\'t want to face. And how did that pan out?\n\nGST was first tabled by Congress. Aadhar was initiated by Congress. All those schemes on that list were mostly started by Congress.\n\nIt also shows that people don\'t vote for "development" or "reform". They vote for Modi out of tribal reasons. That\'s why they will keep voting for him even if the economy goes nowhere, as long as he delivers Hindu Rashtra.'

"To be fair, I prefer Sagarmala to 'National Maritime Development Programme'. Even scheme names where the language has remained constant have been improved. For instance, Skill India sounds better than National Skill Development Program.\n\nAs someone said, you can't blame the current govt on its PR skills. It's the execution that has been lacking. "
'And made them sound easier and better for the common man to understand. Quite a smart and effective move.'

'>  any actual changes in the provision of the schemes   \n\nExactly what I would like to see. There is a huge fucking gap between bashing Modi and deifying him that nobody wants to address. '
">Braced for downvotes but for the complete picture we need to analysis whether it is just a makeover or whether there are any actual changes in the provision of the schemes. \n\n>**Now, I am not saying that every scheme is an improvement over its predecessor** but it would be superficial to say they just renamed the schemes, we need to be aware whether these are better or worse after analyzing it. \n\nAnd ~~what about~~ there are schemes that have had their budgets reduced too. \n\nEdit: Added quote for better context. Removed 'what about' to counter claims of 'whataboutism'. "
"> Remember, the only true original invention of Modi has been Demonetisation.\n\nNo, demonetization is not new either. It has been attempted at least 4 times after 1947, latest being one by Morarji Desai. \n\nAll intended to curb black money. Those who don't remember their history....\n\n"
"I just looked at the rural electrification scheme which is one of the things mentioned in this post.\n\nThese are a few things that were done by Modi's govt. They are actively collecting data on the progress of electrification and exposing it using this dashboard http://garv.gov.in/garv2/dashboard/garv#. Looking at the data there they seem to be making reasonable progress. \n\nI did not find any sources for year over year progress of how many people still do not have electricity. But based on the fact that they are actively collecting data and the progress being shown, they seem to be persistent in their efforts. This is something that we did not see during Congress era. \n\nThe same goes for Jan Dhan Yojana. There is a difference between using state machinery to actively enroll people for banking services and simply getting the RBI to announce a new type of account. They are not the same things.\n\nOur politicians are famous for starting a scheme/work, cutting the ribbon and then dropping the ball. It is the execution that counts and not who first came up with the idea. This post is click-bait.\n\n\n"

"Thanks Modiji for spending more pubic money to advertise these schemes day after day on TV, radio, newspaper.\n\nI mean, why bother about the implementation when you don't hear about them, right? Let's celebrate the PR."

"I can agree with this. But how do they use the same scheme in non-Hindi regions then? Why not have regional names for the schemes if that's the motivation?\n\nAnd the positioning in the media by the government has been that they came out with something new and awesome, which isn't true. "

'What is this "work as slaves" thing which keeps coming up when it comes to the Arabian gulf? A very large chunk of Mallus in the gulf work in white collar office jobs, some of them very lucrative. A lot of businesses have also been started by Mallus in the gulf.

They had a long and hard meeting with Modi and Shah about the results of their survey.\n\n\n\nNow they're delaying polls to give maximum freebies to the public. This along with time, will hopefully change people's minds and they vote BJP again."
"I'm not Mallu, but I do have a decent number of extended family and friends that have white collar jobs in the Gulf, including a Senior Executive in a huge company there. I don't understand why everyone just assumes that working in the gulf=slave labour. Yes there are many labourers too, but there are many white collar professionals too. And they have a better quality of life there than they would in India. I know people who work in UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. "
'You alright there bro? Bro?'
"OMG... They didn't even let him finish. Hope they have mercy on him."
"May be. But it's important to try and engage them in a dialogue instead of pushing them away by calling them 'uneducated', 'brainwashed' or whatever else. It's important to show them facts and the situation around if we want them to change them. Show them what real development look like, like the focus on health and education in Delhi. Show them why demonetisation was idiotic and why Modi is not infallible, show them the hollowness of Modi's words.\n\nRidiculing the other side will isolate them further, like it happened with Trump supporters in the US. We need to instead understand their perspectives and then engage them. "
"One of my favourite examples is mohd Ali. He manages one of the largest civil construction companies in the gulf. He does highways, factories, roads, everything. It's IPO was one of the biggest openings in stock market in Oman.  He's been awarded civilian honour by Oman government here, and also by ministry of external affairs India. He is literally like one of the Tatas here, except he did everything in one single generation, and obviously on a much smaller scale to account for actual market size.  \n \nYou'll find similar business tycoons in many gulf countries.  \n\nIt's obviously not just guys at the top either. These people employ hundreds to thousands of Indians in good jobs. Hardly slave labour."

"Never been to Netherlands, but from a documentary I watched, Netherlands and other European countries are specifically planning their cities to be more bike-friendly and walk-friendly, by having larger bike lanes and pedestrian lanes, and reducing car lanes. They are also reducing parking spaces available, and plan to gradually phase out cars altogether.\n\nThe city is crowded anyways with many stop-lights and cars will slow you down. \n\nAs far as distance is concerned, I'm guessing its the same in Europe, but here in America, all buses and trains have bike-stands. So you bike to the nearest station, get on to the bus or train with bikes, and then get down and bike again.\n\nBikes are also manufactured to be very posture-friendly, hence count as morning exercise as well, and a part of healthy lifestyle."

'> legal age to be married in India is 21 for males and 18 for females\n\nIs this true when Modi got married?'
'Yep child marriage which was never consummated.'
"> Wikipedia says Modi was married when he was 18 and Jasodaben 16, but afaik, legal age to be married in India is 21 for males and 18 for females, so the marriage would be null and void?\n\nNope. It isn't null and void. It's easily voidable if Modiji had just tried to make it void. But he has never done so till now. He is rather busy - I heard he works 21 hours every day. Once he retires may be he will divorce Jashodaben."

The various rounds of selections are as follow:\n1: Selection will be held on Written Exam.\n2: Selection will be held on Interview.\n\nThe irony is even the politicians are not selected with such criteria!\n\nAnd coming to your - a broom is "best equipment"? - if you\'d cared to notice, the place Param Pujya Yogiji did a photo-op was already cleaned while the sanitary/sweeper workers have do it in dust/toxic gases/etc with NO EQUIPMENT.\n\nSo when you compare a broom to no equipment, broom automatically becomes \'the best equipment\'\n\n'

"It looks like the price u/mlunner gave works out to about $3.5/sqft. I did some cursory Googling and that's about 3–10x cheaper than similarly green(-ish) areas in areas with a bit (or quite a lot) more foreigner presence (Hoi An, Vietnam; Nosara, Costa Rica; or even Kovalam further south in Kerala).\n\nThe number and the image is certainly tempting, but I'd think it'd be a stretch for a non-local to live in a village area like this.

'Treat yo self\n'
"The Bharat Ratna has always been awarded under the auspices of the government in power and it is literally impossible for the President, a ceremonial figurehead, to perform all the formalities, order a Bharat  Ratna medal to be made and organize the ceremony to award it without the Union government's consent and assistance.\n\nWhatever excuses Nehruvian bhakts are making about how Rajendra Prasad somehow 'went rogue' and awarded the Bharat Ratna to Nehru all by himself and against the latter's will(Did he blackmail Nehru to attend the ceremony and accept the award too?) is a farce. The truth is the Congress leadership at the time, led by Nehru, decided to award their Prime Minister with the Bharat Ratna while he was still in power. If Nehru had any sense of propriety he'd have refused like Vajpayee did.\n\nhttp://www.ndtv.com/india-news/when-atal-bihari-vajpayee-refused-to-nominate-himself-for-the-bharat-ratna-717834\n\n>His party leaders then decided to quietly move the proposal whenever Mr Vajpayee went abroad. But when he learnt about the plan, Mr Vajpayee reportedly shot it down.\n"
'BAHAHAHAHAHA. Is this for real? He awarded himself?'
'If there ever was an Indian who was actually a Ratna of India, it was Nehru. Because of his vision we became a relative stable and progressive country in our first 60 or so years. We are far from perfect, but a look at Pakistan assures us that at least we were on the right path. It was a good run.\n\nLook at what Sanghis are doing to the country now and imagine where we would have been had they been ruling India right after we got independence.'
"Why should Nehru not have accepted the Bharat Ratna? Was there ever a rule that Bharat Ratna should only be given when a person 'retired' from his career? If anybody deserved the Bharat Ratna it was Nehru - based on his literary career alone. \n\nI see Nehru's Bharat Ratna as similar to Barack Obama's Nobel. It was a bestowal of an honour and a responsibility on a person who was to be a 'spokesman' for something - Obama for hope, Nehru for his vision for India, and through that for all post colonial nations. \n\nWe can all debate whether he deserved it, or not. That's our prerogative. But there was nothing improper or controversial about it. "
"Of the Nehru, By the Nehru and For the Nehru.\n\nPS: Nehru did deserve the award, can't say that for Indira Gandhi though."
'Yes, nehara gave it to himself but he was totally worth it. '
"That is a fig leaf. The President cannot act 'unconstitutionally' and 'on his own intitiative' to order a Bharat Ratna medal, organize the national ceremony and award it to the recipient without the consent and cooperation of the government in power.\n\nThis is a paper-thin excuse to spare Nehru the embarassment of the fact that his own administration nominated him for the country's highest civilian honour while he was Prime Minister, something that would otherwise look like a great act of narcissism. \n\nFor comparison,\n\n[**When Atal Bihari Vajpayee Refused to Nominate Himself for the Bharat Ratna**](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/when-atal-bihari-vajpayee-refused-to-nominate-himself-for-the-bharat-ratna-717834)\n\n>His party leaders then decided to quietly move the proposal whenever Mr Vajpayee went abroad.

'Nehru awarding Nehru a Bharta ratna while chief guest Nehru admires it '
"> Did he nominate himself? - Unless you're saying the president was lying, apparently not.\n\nI'd say the President was trying to dissociate Nehru from the decision since it'd look narcisstic. Nehru certainly did approve of the move, since it would be impossible for the President to order a Bharat Ratna medal and award it to someone without the government's consent. Especially if the recipient is the PM."
"Does the saying 'Self praise is no praise' mean anything?\n\nIt takes away from the merit of an award when the ones awarding it decide to just give it to themselves or people known to be close to them. It will always raise questions about misuse of power and nepotism, whether they deserved it or not.\n\nAlso many other national leaders of great stature including other Prime Ministers like Lal Bahadur Shastri did not receive the Bharat Ratna until decades after their death. Why was Nehru in such a hurry to get it? His party was guaranteed to bestow it on him after his death."
"It's called integrity. The very essence of integrity is doing the right thing when there is nothing compelling you to do it."
"IG: That's a good idea Dad. "
"I'd like to read more, can you link a credible article. \n\nThis is believable, because the first amendment to our constitution was to curb freedom of speech. \n\nLastly I don't think Nehru was a fascist, he thought he was large, grandiose etc, and I agree, IG in her latter part of her career was a pure fascist. \n"
'But but Tharoor, who still says that he will not go against The Family, says that Nehru was great and deserved it.'
'> Yes, **nehara** gave it to himself but he was totally worth it.\n\nThis is J Nehru not Ashish Nehra. \n\n'
'This was not his chamchas like in Vajpayee\'s case (he was one of Nehru\'s most outspoken critics) or just any ordinary president, Why you would think that a man of such stature would chose to cover for Nehru with a "paper thin excuse" is beyond me. If Dr Rajendra fucking Prasad sees fit to give you for an award you fucking receive it without causing an embarrassment. '

"I under where you're coming from. But Nehru definitely did not bestow the award upon himself. He was given it as an honour, by the President. For all we know, it could have become the precedent. If the President had retained the prerogative to decide who'd be Bharat Ratna after Rajendra Prasad, perhaps its award would have remained fair. \n\nYou can have your opinion about whether Nehru deserved it or not. But you definitely cannot say he gave himself the award. He could have rejected it. Perhaps he thought it would be disrespectful to do so - who knows, I do not want to presume too much. \n\n> Also many other national leaders of great stature including other Prime Ministers like Lal Bahadur Shastri did not receive the Bharat Ratna until decades after their death. Why was Nehru in such a hurry to get it? His party was guaranteed to bestow it on him after his death.\n\nSurely you cannot blame Nehru for this? Shastri was a very good PM. His achievements though were as PM of India. Nehru was an international statesman and a scholar of renown even before he became PM. He would have deserved the award even if he had not been Prime Minister. "

Nehru was obsessed with power and he watched warily as the Communists made gains not just in Kerala, but also by organizing peasants in the Telangana region and mill workers in Bombay. \n\nI always have a good laugh when revisionists on /r/India pretend like Nehru was some sort of great liberal. This is the same Nehru who passed the first amendment to our constitution limiting free speech. The same one who prioritized IITs over primary education when 20% of the country was literate. The truth is often very inconvenient for Congress supporters, but as our nation's motto goes: *satyameva jayate*."
"> This was not his chamcha like in Vajpayee's case (he was one of Nehru's most outspoken critics) or just any ordinary president, if Dr Rajendra fucking Prasad sees fit to give you for an award you fucking receive it without causing an embarrassment.\n\nYou're acting like Rajendra Prasad was Nehru's mortal enemy. There were fewer differences between them than between Nehru and Patel and the latter two still had great respect for each other.\n\nThey were peers who had different views on some matters of state. Don't compare it with the political mudslinging you see today. They still worked together professionally and Rajendra Prasad was the only President ever in Indian history to be nominated by his government for a second term. "

If tomorrow Pranab Mukherjee gave one to Mohan Bhagwat would you believe it was him not Modi?\n\nhttp://www.bharatratna.co.in/regulations.htm\n\nThat has always been the procedure: The Prime Minister and incumbent central government nominates the candidates.

Nehru was an international statesman and a scholar of renown even before he became PM. He would have deserved the award even if he had not been Prime Minister.\n\nThere are many worthy names for Bharat Ratna who have never recieved it decades after their deaths. This was also true in the 1950s. Why the hurry to nominate Nehru in particular? You'd think he was a bigger figure in Indian history than Mahatma Gandhi, Akbar and Ashoka combined from the selective significance he is given. Mostly for political purposes.\n\n"

"'both getting an award while...' - but both did not get an award. Getting an award is different from awarding oneself. If you think that's a matter of opinion, to each his own. "
'>"In doing so," Prasad said on July 15, 1955, "for once, I may be said to be acting unconstitutionally, as **I am taking this step on my own initiative and without any recommendation or advice from my Prime Minister; but I know that my action will be endorsed most enthusiastically..."**\n\nYes, he has answered it for you. His action was fully supported and endorsed by the Nehru administration, without which it would not have been possible for him to confer a Bharat Ratna on Nehru.'

She even takes their bloody name. So, you could force people to give equal shares to the girl child, but it'll be negated in individual cases by the girl's husband losing out on his inheritance to his own sisters. What you'd get then, is a fractured system of inheritances, which would help neither party but fuck up a load of family held businesses/agricultural lands through feuds and court cases. On an individual basis, it might be the case that the female loses more money to her brothers getting ancestral inheritance than her husband gets from his sister not getting ancestral inheritance, but on the macro scale it'll even out. And since divorce means effective division of property, the wife does get a share in her husband's property even if it isn't in her name. "
">If girls' parent give the girl child her fair share of paternal property, there would be no need of dowry. Just saying. Blame selfish parents of girl child. They don't want to give share to the female child, who will not take care of them when they get old.\n\nYou are right about that. All this dowry thing is prevalent because people don't treat their girl and boy child equally. It is because the girl child leaves you when she is married and the boy gets a wife who comes and serves you in your old days. Some ways to solve this problem:\n\n1) Equal rights for girls and boys in paternal property. This should be by default and the girl would have to explicitly take an undertaking if she wants none of her paternal property. Right now I think if they do not claim, everyone is fine. Most often unless they hate their brothers they don't claim because 'society'.\n\n2) Educate your girl child. If your daughter is educated and holds a job she is not dependent on anyone to provide for her. You don't need to find a groom for her. Allow her to find a groom if she desires or take her wish into consideration if she is fine with you picking one for her. There is a very good chance that prospective brides and their family would not demand or demand less dowry just because this woman is going to be a source of income for the family. It will be out of pure greed and yet solve the problem.\n\n3) And most important. Somehow if it was possible for people to move away from their parents after marriage. But this is a huge issue. One thing better about our culture is that old people are not left to fend for themselves or sent to old age homes. Even if you think sending to old age homes is fine, there is the problem of money. We are a poor country, we can't afford that. The logistics of it is very messy."

Here are some ideas of the top of my head.\n\n1) Anti-littering laws and fines\n2) Proper waste disposal system with proper maintenance of dustbins.\n3) Compulsory (public hygiene?) classes in schools\n\nBut there are some things that are solely in the government's hands and the public is helpless in that manner. \n\nDo you agree that Swacch Bharat includes clean air and forest cover? \n\nThe government has made environmental clearance for infrastructure projects near national parks way easier. The number of projects cleared has also increased. Environmental damage is not a price we should be willing to pay for business-friendliness.\n\nI am not criticising Modi as an individual, but the government as a whole. There are obviously places where they could improve in terms of Swacch Bharat. We all want a cleaner nation, and that isn't going to happen without a 100% effort from the government. "

"If this happens, two generations later the Indian National Anthem would become synonymous with something much more beautiful.

Jan Gana Man -- those words would have a new meaning for all of us. We won't be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests.

Then only we will start to see real world catching up.\n\nI mean, a lonely shopkeeper at the end of a small town won't get UPI from gov ads, he'll get onboard when his son comes from city and shows UPI is way more secure than cash, cheaper than POS, and less hassle than e wallets."

'I started the episode at 7:50 today and watched it without any issue whatsoever. Played in phone and streamed on TV through chrome cast. Been doing this since last year. Think hotstar is getting lot of undeserved hate.'
'I do not see any reason to watch it illegally now. You get the show uncut immediately. hotstar definitely has technically issues. But it is certainly not as bad as people are making it out to be. I watched it at 8.30 by chromecasting it to my tv. It worked well without any glitches. If you are someone who can afford 200 bucks a month, then please watch it legally. This is how you enable businesses. '

'Sorry for hijacking the thread but since it\'s about Hotstar and I have posted previously, let me give you an update about [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6jea87/we_south_indians_need_english_subtitles_for_hindi/). Hotstar doesn\'t provide English subtitles for South Indians to watch Hindi programs while *some* movies like the Malayalam movie "Marubhoomiyile Aana" (about an Indian Arab returning to Kerala) and the Tamil serial "As I am suffering from Kudal" have English subtitles. Since more than a 100 people upvoted my first post, I think r/India would be interested in my [photoshopped post] (https://twitter.com/PiyushWatchesTV/status/886937698392567808) which I have tweeted to Karthika Nair and the other teams.

"Kerala, NE States will still have it easy. You dont have a Sanghi govt at state level. You can always choose to not implement this law strictly plus ofcourse since you have the aam janata support, you can take the Centre to SC as well. However the rest will be in trouble. The local govt will enforce this law. Vigilantes will take it upon themselves to make it a success. And even if these state govts get voted out of power next timed, it will be difficult for their successor to reverse these laws. e.g. BJP losing in UP next time. It wont be easy for Akhilesh or Mayawati or whoever, to cancel these laws out. Despite their own suppporter base, there will be an equally large number of vigilantes ready to attack. It's going to get messy."
"How much more backward can a country go ? Seriously !! Proud of Kerela for taking a stand, having some voice at least. No government has the right to dictate what people should and shouldn't eat !"

'>In a move amounting to a virtual ban on unregulated trade of cattle, the Centre on Friday announced strict rules to prohibit sale of animals for slaughter or religious sacrifice at livestock markets and animal fairs that are a common occurrence in rural areas. The animals under purview are cows, bulls, bullocks, buffaloes, steers, heifers, calves and camels.\n\n>The official reasoning is the order is intended to end uncontrolled and unregulated animal trade. The rules won\'t apply to goats and sheep, often sacrificed during Id. Apart from the stated objective of curbing unregulated trade, mixing of milch animals with older, less healthy beasts meant for slaughter, the move has political overtones in tune with\xa0BJP\'s pledge to "protect" the cow and its progeny\xa0.\n\n>The rules are in line with BJP\'s emphasis on shutting down illegal slaughterhouses during the UP poll and the views expressed by senior leaders calling for the promotion of "cattle wealth" rather than the meat trade.\n\n>Meat export organisations have protested the move saying it wassudden and arbitrary and will affect their business\xa0that is already taking a hit over the actions of BJP governments that have discouraged the trade.\n\n>Activists welcomed the step taken in the wake of Supreme Court\'s directions for regulation of livestock markets. "We commend the ministry for their vision and their efforts to protect the most vulnerable animals, be it animals used as reproductive machines for breeding or animals that are cruelly sold off at unregulated markets," said Gauri Maulekhi, trustee at\xa0People for Animals(PFA).\n\n>With the onus being on cattle owners to certify that cattle will not be sold for slaughter or sacrifice, the trade in animals will be more regulated, said officials.\n\n>The rules will bring in new norms for the functioning of well-known livestock markets or annual cattle fairs like the ones at Sonepur (Bihar) and Pushkar (Rajasthan) or in other states including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n>Animals for slaughter can now be bought directly from farms — a move expected to ensure traceability and food safety standards and weed out middlemen between farmers and slaughterhouses, and increase the income of farmers who rear such animals for trade. New rules have, however, not banned sale of such animals for agriculture purposes or milk. But it can be done only through regulated livestock markets which will have to adhere to safety standards and certain do\'s and don\'ts to avoid cruelty against the animals.\n\n>The rules, notified by the ministry of environment, will have to be implemented within three months across the country, including Kerala, which allow cow slaughter. Though the issues relating to\xa0cow slaughter\xa0come under the \'state\' subject in terms of making law and framing the rules, the new central rules are notified under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act of 1960 that gives the Centre power over animal welfare.\n\n>"The rules intend to promote the concept of \'farm to fork\', which revolves around the traceability of food products as they move through the supply chain. Due to the present system of open markets that allow trade of both milch and slaughter animals, and multiple buyers and sellers, it becomes impossible to trace an animal back to its farm of origin", said N G Jayasimha, managing director of the Humane Society International/India, who was part of the drafting committee of the Regulation of Livestock market rules.\n\n>He said, "The animals being sold for slaughter are generally unfit, making the markets a major hub for the spread of infectious diseases as there are no records and no liability. Cattle suffering from foot & mouth disease or mad cow disease may be sold. So, the idea behind the new rules is to ensure that only healthy animals are traded for agricultural purposes, whereas animals for slaughter must be sourced directly from farms to ensure traceability".\n\n>The rules also provide for setting up a district-level authority to enforce animal protection laws on the ground, including those against illegal slaughter. As part of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017, it makes a provision of constitution of Animal Market Committee for management of animal markets in the district. The Committee will have to ensure that no person will bring a cattle to an animal market unless upon arrival he has furnished a written declaration signed by the owner of the cattle that "the cattle has not been brought to market for sale for slaughter".\n\n>The purchaser will have to give an undertaking that he/she will not sell the animal for purpose of slaughter, follow the state cattle protection or preservation laws, not sacrifice the animal for any religious purpose and not sell the cattle to a person outside the state without the permission as per the state cattle protection laws.\n\n>Under the rules, no animal market will be allowed in a place that is within 25 km from any state border or that is within 50 km from any international border. Besides, unfit animals, pregnant animals, animals who have not been vaccinated and animals under six months of age cannot be displayed or sold at any of the cattle market anywhere in the country.\n\n>The market committee will have to keep a record of name and address of the purchaser and procure his identity proof. The committee will also have to ensure that the purchaser of the animal gives a declaration that he shall not sell the animal up to six months from the date of purchase and shall abide by the rules relating to transport of animals made under the Act or any other law for the time being in force.\n\n>Since the rules include buffaloes in their definition of cattle, big traders and exporters will initially feel the heat in procuring the animals for meat. But the regulation of slaughter houses and closure of illegal ones will ultimately bring consistency of supply in the market and ensure food safety standard. India is currently a major buffalo meat exporting country which grew from Rs 3,533 crore in 2007-08 to Rs 26,685 crore in 2015-16.\n\n>*"The three-month time given for implementing these rules will be sufficient to regulate the practice. After all, the specific provisions will only apply to animals in livestock market and animal seized as case properties. The legal slaughter houses can directly procure animals from farms", said an official.*'

"Our government hasn't always been like this. Being a early 90's kind, I've grown up in a time of relative peace with a bustling economy. In school I was taught to respect and love people from various backgrounds and we were taught to be proud of our varied heritage, that all Indians are my brothers and sisters (except my crush, of course). I grew up with Hindu, Muslim and Christians neighbours on the same floor as me without any issues, ever. This is what India is about. *Unity in Diversity*\n\nWe ought to fight any one that intends to divide us along any lines. While our methods may vary, our aim ought to be the progress of every individual in this country, irrespective of caste or creed, to lift the poor out of poverty, to increase jobs and wealth, while protecting the environment, to ensure a wholesome education for our children, so that they may continue to prosper and bring forth new ideas for a new age.

'And this is exactly why I left Quora. That site was an amazing experience until the fellow Indian crowd invaded and flooded it to the brim, and brought the trashy content and cringe along with them.'
'To the people talking about the fact that such behavior exists only among aspirants, let me clarify you that people studying at IITs (not freshers only, but from all the years) have the same mentality.\n\nYou can easily find a guy from Mathematics and Computing branch who cannot tell the difference between mean and median (yes, it really happened), yet would have spent one or two years at Kota for his JEE preparation.\n\nOf course, I am not generalizing, but what I am saying is such behavior is not limited to the aspirant crowd. People already in IITs will do too.'

'Not only Quora, you will be really amazed to the point of disappointment and then depression and then some more if you read Youtube comments and Twitter posts on general Indian stuff. The toxicity was so bad in Youtube some 5 years back I had to completely withdraw from it. Nowadays I just watch Linus tech. :D\n\nComing to your case, I didn\'t clear IIT-JEE but I got in a reputed government engineering college with +100% placement. And I was still looked down upon by friends, neighbours, people who didn\'t matter, etc. :D \n\nI have worked some years, earned a fair sum, now preparing for government service exams and every now and then when someone gets in IIT, my mother calls for chit-chat and very sneakily slips in "someone someone got in IIT" where her voice changes in a way that I am supposed to react.\n\nThere is a whole generation who believes that life after high-school starts and stops with IIT. Many of those who get in IIT are brilliant minds and deserve it because they tried harder. But some easily triggered butthurt dicks will always be there, won\'t they? I mean, no one can really help it. Popular Indian internet forums are filled with these keyboard-warriors who are ready to take shit to the next level at the slightest sign of intimidation.\n\nCoupled with the fact that we are made to believe education in west is shit and people there don\'t even know BODMAS formula, surely an \'outsider\' is going to get cornered. \n\nJust forget and don\'t really care about threats from Quora users. Yes, getting hostile reply from a foreign country can be disturbing. But they are Indian Quora users... they ask shit like "how does the world see and perceive Indians" and "what will happen if you kiss in public"...'
'well  this is something unbelievable .\nI knew Indians were a bit of fanatics when it comes to IIT but this extreme behavior is sad.\n\nNow I have a question here.\n\nGeneral view on reddit has always been that iit papers are easy and can be solved by anyone good at rote learning  . I always ignored that view because I felt randia was jelly and even when I attended my iit jee coaching [ couldnt clear it]  I found it anything but easy.\nIs the paper really that ineffective  ? '
"I sat JEE. The culture around it was sickening. I feel like one of life's greatest escapes was my complete suckiness at that exam. I'd rather work in a coal mine that hang in that company of people."

"The problem is as with many non-aligned nations is education system puts more effort into brainwashing Indians into the belief that they are intellectually superior to all other races.\n\nSame education system that fails it's students, a government that doesn't dole out nearly as many exit visas to allow its citizens to take advantage of student visas as often as H2 visas.  The same government that doesn't allow dual citizenship.\n\nNor does the government bother to properly verify education and experience background checks for its outsourcing vendors.  There is no real effective means to check what it's citizens have in regards to education or competence.  \n\nThen there is pm modi with his aryanism. \n\nProblem is India puts more effort into upholding it's reputation and appearance than fulfilling its promises to its people.\n"
'Just curious - Are JEE papers available online?\n'
"JEE quality has gotten shittier by the year. I wouldn't be that surprised. But then again, we are talking about Quora teenagers here.\n\nJust saw the mains paper for this year. It is risible compared to the time I took the test. Not even erstwhile AIEEE level. I only made it to the extended merit list then. Didn't waste another year and got into another good college."
"Randians, for long we have sharpened our wits, honed our knowledge, and reached a superior plane of understanding about the nature of this illusory world of the internet. It is time to come out of the shadows. (I don't mean turn off night mode.)\n\nBut now, the age is turning, and our people call. \n\nBrigade Quora. Invade, Conquer and Civilise. \n\nThe Barbarians must fall. We must build an internet Civilisation that will stand the test of time. "
"Doesn't this also highlight the fucked up rote learning mess Indian education system is ?  I mean sure Jack is a brilliant guy and is in a top notch university with 3 years of physics training. But many people that go to Kota for IIT prep get specifically coached for 2-3 years to crack this very particular exam. They solve thousands of similar questions , the class session are gruelling like 12 hours a day round the year. Yet most of them are not able to even clear the exam.  Whereas this guy didn't prepare for IIT exams, is taking a general physics degree course and yet breezes through 'world's toughest engineering exam' in 1/3 of the time and 100% accuracy. Could students taking physics course in our top institutes claim the same ?"

'i think you are missing a context here, see you are probably in a western country. In that place you probably get a job even if you have a diploma(even granting the fact that you may study much more in a diploma than any Indian ever would). Here is the thing, the only part that works right in this God forsaken country called India is its education policy, by which i mean free and compulsory education in lower forms and merit based heavily subsidized education in undergraduate and higher. The difference between life opportunities of an educated and an uneducated person here amounts to the difference between first world nation and third world nation, education is the ticket. So for some people getting a rank in this exam is like fulfilling of a prophecy. In that context you can see why those guys(most certainly only guys) got so disturbed, they have known nothing tougher than that exam and then believed their entire life (till then at least) that they can face anything in the world after they have aced this paper. It is that fear and lack of self assuredness that lead to this out break couple that with the fact that India is very much a feudal republic and you get the full context.'

If it lands in trouble, will the subscribers be willing to pay the legal fees? "
"Imagine a expressway is to made for the first time in a country. Netflix and Amazon are two companies who decide to build this expressway. Now, people would want to use a expressway only if it doesn't have those speed bumpers like on the existing highway roads. Both companies take a different approach, Netflix builts a expressway without any bumpers, while Amazon builds expressway with a bumper.   \n\nPeople defend Amazon's decision saying they are just playing it safe since no one has ever driven on a bumper-less road before and it might too much to digest for people, so keep it safe. Netflix figures that it is good opportunity as people like to travel with speed without obstruction and let's risk building without bumpers.   \n\nWhich would appeal more to people? and even help change people's attitude towards high-speed driving ( here censorship + video)"

This 500 Rs yearly subscription thing is a very miniscule business in a country where most would laugh at the very idea of paying for online shows.\nIf they get caught in a controversy, their online business could get targeted. Remember how Snapdeal was targeted for no fault of theirs during the Aamir Khan controversies.\n\nI fully support Amazon on being cautious. As for Netflix, this is their primary business, they charge far more than Amazon, so they have to take risks and be the best option out there.

"Hi I'm from Malappuram district though this place is like 30 kms from my place.  So many people commenting like Muslim majority, regressive, communal  etc - let me say that I never faced any trouble or objection for being in a Muslim majority area. Neighbors are really friendly and helpful.\n\nProblem, for me, is that there are lots of religious speeches in public happening recently ( they call it Wayadh  or something ) . And those speakers ( mulla kinds ) speak a lot of stupid and regressive stuffs, but not Extremist but total retarded stuffs like Muslims women shouldn't ride a bike, or should not be celebrating World Cup , that Messi is a adulterer, you know that kind of stuff. \n\nNever anything against non Muslims ( at least not in public ) but they say things which would hold back Muslims from the mainstream. \n\nBut even though , they say all those and people go listen to them, I don't think many of them follow those people. \nLike my neighbors. Most of their husbands are in Gulf. Till a couple of years back, if they want to out they would get an auto . But after a girl got a scooter, she and her mother would go to hospitals and stuff on that. After that many women got themselves scooters . Muslim women in burqa and hijabs riding scooters are actually familiar here. Like my neighbor aunty said , it's better to ride a scooter than going out with a stranger ( auto driver).\n\nPoint is Malappuram is not Extremist terrorist place, but more like friendly, helpful with regressive or Orthodox views. \n\n"

"Happened to me, but with Swiggy.\nI had placed a 2k order, but the restaurant didn't confirm the order even after 20 minutes. Called Swiggy, asked them to cancel it. I was told that the order was confirmed but not updated on the app and the delivery guy was at the restaurant.

And this was in Greater Noida!\n\nTL:DR\nHad a similar situation with Swiggy, the canceled the order and credited the money to the bank account. Their customer support is awesome. "
'Faced a similar problem myself once, Got half f my order so delivery guy made a quick run to get the missing items, meanwhile when I check my order it was not what I had ordered rather non-veg, considering I am a vegetarian, I contacted Zomato for support they said they\'ll call me back once they have a chat with the restaurant first. Waited only for a call back in which they in an extremely ignorant way said "we can\'t help you." I said okay, ask them to take my order back then because I didn\'t want it. The reply was a literal "no". I know the basic rule while seeking support is to stay as humble as possible but the woman I was on the phone with pissed me beyond the point I yelled back at her and hung up. Called the restaurant who apologised and took the order back. Funny how the restaurant was more apologetic and rather better at providing me support than Zomato was.\nZomato support is terrible.'

All you have to do is to say that you were not happy with the sevice and prove your communication to the retailer thats it and your money will be refunded.'
'op at what time did you place the order  ?  and how long was it before you reached out to them regarding order confirmation and delivery  ?\n\nIf it was like only 5 or 10 minutes then you are being an asshole\nIf it is as long as 20-30 minutes then zomato is being a chuttad here , they should have cancelled the order and issued a refund or with your consent direct the order to some other restaurant\n\nThis is what foodpanda  does  . '
'Wow, that is one hungry customer on the chat. Zomato guy was pretty polite to be honest. All he said was that he cant cancel the order without the consent of the restaurant. At a glance this seems reasonable since the restaurant is delivering the food, and they should know if the order is to be cancelled. Of course, zomato could not reach them which made it tricky. He said he cant issue a refund without talking to restaurant, not that he wont or zomato wont ever do it. \n\nRegarding credits and direct to the bank a/c, its a bit tricky situation in India. These firms wait for 2-3 days to get the money from payment gateways, and those payment gateways charge about 2-3% of every transaction fee. Even in the case of refund or chargeback. With Stripe - an international competitor, the fees is flat 5% but the refund is free. Even Paytm charges the vendors if I remember correctly. Ideally, with a refunded transaction, you should have a system where no one looses. Credits are fine but they are restrictive as in a user cant use zomato credits to buy tickets. Even with Paytm, you cant use Paytm cash unless the vendor has Paytm account too. Maybe, there lies an opportunity. '

"Pleasantly surprised to discover how popular Linkin Park actually was in the entire Indian subcontinent. Here's a good example of how music has actually had a tangible impact on musical tastes of a sizeable chunk of people. It was my gateway to rock. Started with in the end... The whole rap metal thing was really catchy. \n\nThen I discovered Faint and that was just something I had imagined what a perfect song would sound like... And it existed! I used to try to imitate the rap and keep up with Chester's high pitched singing... I think I did learn quite a bit on how to hold a note from him. \n\nI hope this guy knew the kind of influence he had or still has on young minds. He has reached out to a such a wide demographic of people that possibly no one ever has. Kids, teenagers, adults, people who barely understood English... True emotion in the music. "
'LP was practically the only music I used to listen to back when I was a teen. I remember when I first started music lessons, my teacher asked me what kind of music I listened to. I went on this long speech about how they were the best music ever and that I listen to them everyday and nothing else. After that he said "Well, you should listen to more music", and nothing else for the day XD. So yeah, usual teenage cringe. I even had that black and white booklet than came with the Minutes to Midnight CD, I read that thing a million times. \n\nI grew out of LP into metal after MtM, but they\'re still pretty awesome. Some of the first songs I covered were Hybrid Theory and Meteora songs. It\'s a damn shame :(.'
"I remember back in around 2002-03. I came across their CD selling for ₹495. And I couldn't afford it so had settled for the cassette for ₹150 instead.\n\nAfter listening to Hybrid Theory I pretty much fell in love with the band. I'd spend the days memorizing lyrics and rap them to impress my classmates. It was dope and my first foray into heavier music. Basically every other pop music sounded dull in comparison to their music. I had sold my soul during Meteora and Reanimation. But I disliked their musical direction after that and kinda fell out of it. LP also got me interested into more heavier and alternative music then.\n\nOf course Chester was at the crux of it all. The way he conveyed emotions through song used to crush my heart in songs like Numb, With You, Crawling, etc.  RIP Chester, my teenage years would have sucked without you and LP."
'When I read that Chester Bennington passed away, I was in shock. It didn\'t really sink in until I put Hybrid Theory and Meteora on loop and realized how I know each and every word of each and every song by heart. And then it hit me, that how important this band was for me as I was growing up. Sure, me and a lot of other Linkin Park fans may have moved on to more "mature" music, but every person who grew up in the 2000s will have a special place in their heart for Chester and Linkin Park. He and the band were definitely the gateway to music I love today. A part of my childhood literally died with him. RIP Brother.\n\n'

'The first English band I started listening to. In the end was my jam. Me and a bunch of friends used to sing along their songs.\n\nFuck man, Linkin park is an important part of my teens. Hybrid theory, Meteora, Collision course etc. \n\nChester was an phenomenal artist. RIP brother.\n\n'
"I got to know about them when I was in 7th class, that was 8 years ago. Since then I have spent many hours listening to their songs. Whenever I used to feel down I used to listen to their songs. I have made good friends because of this band too. This is a big deal to me as I am very shy and always had trouble at making friends. Through them I got to know aboit about other bands like green day, tokio hotel , the fray, sum 41, coldplay, u2 , one republic etc. This news hits too close to home for me. I am literally tearing up as I am writing this comment. RIP Chester. We will never forget you. You're a legend in our eyes. "
"I am fortunate enough to have seen Linkin Park twice in concert. Once in [Abu Dhabi](http://mithunonthe.net/2010/12/21/uae-2010-inside-ferrari-world-abu-dhabi-f1-race-linkin-park-concert/) and again in [Singapore](http://mithunonthe.net/2012/02/09/singapore-f1-race-day-forbidden-broadway-linkin-park-avalon-club-photos/). I even got the chance to meet Mike Shinoda and ask him when Linkin Park would come to India. He said they have tried for years but it the never worked out with promoters. I'm sad that the day LP finally do come to India for a concert, Linkin Park fans here would never get a chance to hear Chester sing :(\n\nChester Bennington was easily one of rock music's finest vocalists. Man, the guy could scream but also sing so well with any emotion. I'm so sad about his passing. I will treasure the chances I got to see LP live in concert. I don't know what the future of the band looks like now but I know even if they manage to find a replacement singer, it will never be the same. Chester was a HUGE part of Linkin Park's sound! "
"All those lyrics. This really puts things in perspective. Back then, I could relate to them out of teenage angst and anger at my parents. Many years later, when I was suffering from depression, I used to feel that those lyrics were too real. I shut the band out and started listening to other genres, couldn't get used to them, and stopped listening to music all together for almost a year. Something that most people do not realise about depression is that it doesn't go away just like that once you seek help. It's an uphill battle. One day at a time. Medication and exercise will help, but it takes a long time before you start appreciating your self-worth again.\n\nLinkin Park will always be 'the' band for me. I remember Meteora, Hybrid Theory, and Minutes to Midnight were the first albums I bought as soon as I started earning. If I hadn't been introduced to them, I would've probably graduated from Backstreet Boys and Venga Boys to contemporary pop. I'm glad that I went the alt rock, alt metal, metal, and classic rock way."
'This is a post I wouldn\'t have expected on this sub. LP had quite a following in India as far as I\'d seen. The usual growth was "Pop Music -> LP -> Other genres". At least that\'s what I\'d seen with a lot of people. \n\nShinoda himself has said that the lyrics to most of their earlier songs are pop-py and so that\'s why I feel it was so good to listen to. With their sound and lyrics that you could relate to, it made them very accessible as opposed to something like Seether or Slipknot. But then again that probably is just me. \n\nI commented on the r/music thread about my experiences with LP and there\'s no use regurgitating that. I\'ll just take the time here to say this:\n\nThe idea that depression is just fleeting or something that can be easily overcome is very prelevant in India. Sometimes it is that case but sometimes it isn\'t. Depression is a real issue and the social and cultural reasons that drive it, in addition to the other causes for it is a wholly different can of worms. \n\nThere are people who can help. If you\'re depressed, talk to people. I know it\'s the hardest thing to do; believe me, I know firsthand. Anyone who you think would or could help. And if you can\'t find them, there are people online who can help. Anything is better if nothing is your only other option. \n\nThe first step you have to take is a step. Just that. And then remind yourself that you did. And build on that. It\'s what I try to do. \n\nAnd for the people who haven\'t dealt with this. There are tons of people who have depression or anxiety. People like that wear masks. I know I have and I still do. So, try to be more empathetic with people. After all, we are all human beings and on this tiny blue dot together. Why not make it better for our compadres, eh?\n\nJust thought I\'d say this, seeing as it\'s relevant as fuck here. And for anyone who\'s trying to deal with this and can\'t cope, I know what you\'re feeling. Just play some LP for ol\' times sake and rock out. It\'s what he would have wanted. Probably. '

"Linkin park was my childhood company.There was a time I used to listen to only their songs and music. That is mainly due to Chester's screaming and melodious vocals; since then my taste has changed, I have become more mature. But today the first thing that I saw after waking up in the morning was a notification from a news site on my smartphone, saying he committed suicide. I was shocked; partly because I haven't listened to their songs for a long long time, and almost had forgotten about them. But today, all my childhood days came crashing to my recollection, and I felt what a great impact LP has played in my life. Depression is a dangerous thing, and that proved it again today. But Chester, you had a huge positive impact in my life,and I can't thank you enough. I pray your family members lead long, prosperous happy lives. RIP\n"
"When I first got into college, coming from village I didn't really have any clue about the western music scene. A friend of mine introduced me to their album called Reanimation and that was one of the first bands I had properly listened to and fell in love with their album. It opened doors for so many bands and my playlist has kept on growing ever since.\n\nRIP Chester."
'Linkin Park made college life wonderful, all those jamming sessions on the dance floor with college friends, shout from the core of our heart. Amazing memories. Too Soon Chester :( RIP'
'Listening to all their songs again, I feel like they were orchestrated for this day...'
'I can certainly say that a vast majority of indians who did not have any exposure to phoren music in their childhood, Linkin Park music was the stepping stone. And by majority, i really mean a whole lot of bunch. The time when we did not even understand the meaning of lyrics, In The End was the song we were humming day in and out... when the lyrics did not make any sense; Numb was still an anthem. Slowly and gradually when english began to make sense, we started their music even more.. such affable lyrics paved the way to expose us to even more phoren music...\n\nNonetheless, we all have had that one moment in our life when either holding a beer bottle, or with friends in a college fest or karaoke... or even if we are alone, we have all sang along the lines\n\n"I got so far...\nIn the End..\nIt doesnt even matter..."\n\nRIP Chester!'
'Oh man! Terrible... I am even more shocked to see its depression. \n\nMy first LP cassette was of Reanimation. LP was my gateway to rock music for me, although they changed their style later one, it was still pretty good music. \n\nI was not in peace to have taken that step, I hope he has more supportive people/companions in his next life. '
"I could never fit in with my social circles, back in school and I always turned to Linkin Park for solace. Their studio albums, their EPs, demos, acapellas, Underground albums, I went through everything. \n\nThere was a time where I had printed the lyrics of all of their songs and I kept them on my bedside. It seems like such a crazy thing to do. \n\nTheir music, their out of studio interviews inspired (and still does) humility and compassion. I grew up with that. \n\nThere were Linkin Park fan clubs in Orkut, where I made many friends, who I still keep up with, after 12 years (wow, it's been that long eh?). I owe a lot of me to them, and I feel sad for this loss.\n\nRIP Chester. "
'Linkin Park was basically how a lot of us got introduced to western music. It urged me to pick up this form of music as a hobby, and this has been one of the best decisions of life. \n\nTo be honest, I got over their sound after a few years. Today though, I revisited those tunes and they evoked the exact same feelings I got years back; a feeling that Music goes way beyond some stupid boundary and language and that even in apparently "crass" tunes and lyrics as people would call them, there is depth to be found. \n\nYou\'ll be missed Chester. \n\nIn the end, it always mattered. '
"Linkin Park was is my favorite band of all time. I remember my first ever friend in 6th grade introduced me to this band, and song was one step closer and boy i was blown, away the raspiness of Bennington's voice was different, it was new and it was amazing. Me and my friend tried to replicate the chemistry between Mike and Chester. I also remember borrowing CDs from my friend to listen to linkin park, lovely days. I loved each and every song they made. Hybrid theory, Meteora, Minutes to midnight  and a thousand suns were not just great albums they were\n**Perfect Albums** \n\nYou could really hear the maturity in Chester's voice in each and every album.\n\nFuck! i'm crying, now i feel what is like to lose someone who you admire the most. It was my dream to see Linkin Park live but i guess it will always be a dream. I hope he finds peace. Will always love Linkin park."
"Thanks for starting this thread here. \n\nLinkin Park was such a big part of my teenage years that I rarely listened to any other singer, I even stopped listening Hindi songs because I loved LP's songs so much. \n\nEven though at that time I didn't understand what the songs actually meant, I never stopped listening. \n\nNow after all these years, me and my friends were waiting for them to come to India so that we can actually see our childhood legends live. Guess, I have to live with this weight that I never got to see him. \n\nWe lost an angel, I hope he rest in peace. "
"Linkin Park was always my favorite band. I never heard too much of their songs, but I loved the few popular ones they had. About three months back, I discovered Spotify. I would listen to albums at stretch, and when I read about how following artists makes them recommend similar music, and hell yeah, I followed Linkin Park.\n\nI was on the path to be a fan, but it's all over now. Linkin Park is dead. It will always be my favorite band. \n\nP.S. Radiohead is kinda similar, and I like One OK Rock as well, please do suggest more if you can."
"Their music basically introduced me to the whole world of English music. I can't be more thankful. I remember me and my best friend (who has now passed away) loved to hear his songs so much. We would play video games together, with LP songs running in the background. When we used to exchange songs with each other, the LP mp3 songs still have his name saved inside of since 2010. We had all their songs saved in those Pentium 3 computers that had 80 GBs of HDD altogether. Holy fuck man, LP was my adolescent. You will be really missed Chester. Thank you! :("
"So as a kid I was very sheltered and listened to mainly Disney crap and old rock songs my parents played until 4th grade when my friend loaned me a linkin park cd and it was great. That's kinda what I see as the birth of the music taste I have now. I am a musician now so that never wouldve happened without LP. Rip Chester."
'Minutes to midnight was my first ever "english album". I had memorised all the songs from it and, me and my brother used to sing them while playing. I woke up today with his text announcing Chester\'s demise and I kind of teared up. I used to listen to LP a lot in first of year of college (New Divide had come out back then), and have a lot of memories attached to it.\n\nTheir songs had meaning, and it was simple enough to understand.\n\nPlus, their lyrics, just any para made for a cool status update on FB (or scrapping on orkut).\n\nRIP Chester'
"I couldn't sleep this whole night. \nThis powerful lyrics fells like Chester's good-bye. \n\n*In this farewell\n\nThere's no blood, there's no alibi\n\n'Cause I've drawn regret\n\nFrom the truth of a thousand lies\n\nSo let mercy come and wash away\n\nWhat I've done*"
"Remember fondly going to those shitty sify cyber cafes where you had to purchase tokens for a set amount of time. I would buy those 15 min. tokens and listen to 'Crawling' and 'In the end' and thinking hell this is awesome. LP' songs were the anthem for teenage angst. May God grant him peace which he could not find here."
'It was 2009 when i heard them for the first time and i still listen to numb.\nThey had this magic in their music which would relate to everybody.\nIts a great loss.'
'RIP Chester. \n\nI remember watching the "What I\'ve Done" music video and showing it everyone in excitement because "Gandhi is in English song" '
'I bought intex speakers from my birthday money when i was in 8th standard just to listen to hybrid theory. I even loved their latest album. What a sad news to wake up to..😟'
"Hybrid theory was the first full album I had ever listened to of any band. The song 'In The End' was an anthem to me and my friends when we were teenagers. This is really sad news.\n\nAlthough, I grew out of Linkin Park, and went on to listen and favour other bands (Soundgarden and Audiouslave…RIP Chris Cornell). Linkin Park was one of my favorites growing up in Mumbai, and really helped shape my musical tastes. Will always be grateful for that.\n\nRIP Chester Bennington "
"Wtf Yesterday I was reading a article called Talented Singers Who didn't Reach 50 and now This Morning I am reading This...Rip Truly A talented Singer "
'I know that LP was a famous band all over the world, but when it comes to india (especially me and my friends) they were the reason we started listening to the English songs. I can still listen to the "numb" and i will start having the visions from my past, my childhood, huh.. Those days were awesome, we were happy then.'
"I still remember the first time when my friend played Numb in his computer when I was in class 10, it felt so good. LP songs are usually deep and edgy, it will hit you hard. I grew up listening to LP all my teens. Like any other band their music evolved, many didn't like it.\n\nI follow the band on Instagram they were touring all around. This was a such a huge shock. Rest in peace Chester <3"
"I can now relate to how people must've felt when Paul Walker died.\n\nI was listening to What I've Done. One of the line is -\n\n> Forgive me for.. what I've done\n\nNope Nope Nope"
"\n\nAs a youngin Linkin Park was constantly on repeat on my Walkman, and their's were the first CDs I bought. Still have my well worn cassettes of Hybrid Theory and Meteora. \n\nYou touched hearts of millions my friend. \n\nRock in Peace 🤘\n\n"
'will love you always CHESTER BENNINGTON.'
"Damn sad. Still remember my school days listening to Linkin Park. Singing what I've done and friends correcting when I messed up lyrics. We had good laugh that day. In the end, Numb, breaking the habit, Numb/encore, faint are my absolute favorites. Linkin Park opened up different music world to me. It suited my mood in those days. Linkin Park was my therapy. Thanks Chester. RIP."
"Thank you, everyone, for such an overwhelming response. Great to see so many people sharing their stories and how much Linkin Park's music contributed to this sentiment that we all share today. \n\nRest in peace, Chester. You'll always be in our hearts. "
"Here here, Minutes to Midnight was The first music CD I ever brought by stealing money from my mother's purse. And then got caught, received a good scolding!\n\n\nAnd then some time later brought Meteora. Played theses two for hours on end. Good times.\n "

'Hybrid theory was the reason i learnt lyrics of every song and i could really understand why lyrics were so important to a rock song.'
'Till first year of my college I thought Linkin Park was a park somewhere and almost all of my friends have visited once. Gradually, I came to know about the band and got so happy after listening to them. '

'The cost of Bandra-Worli SeaLink after all the litigation was 1500 crores. The cost of Mumbai-Pune expressway was around 1500 crores. Yes, there is a time value of money angle to the costs I stated, but  this 3600 crores for a statue and a few other things is way too much. '

"This whole jumla is done to appease the Marathas in MH. Often proponents of this give an excuse that this will bring revenue through tourism. (Just like Mayawati said before constructing that monument in Noida that not a soul visits.) \n\nIndia is in dire threat to appeasement politics. It should be noted that in democracy, particularly in India, **Politicians and the Government's main objective is to either get elected or to get re-elected. Any public development policies are purely incidental and of secondary nature.** \n\nBJP thinks that it will get elected in Maha, therefore appeasement politics to attract Maratha voters have started. \n\nIf you truly want revenue from monuments, why not develop monuments which shivaji himself has built? The hill forts around western ghats, naval forts, Buildings in pune. Why don't they attract foreign tourists to those monuments by developing a good tourist plans. Not only the locals around those forts will earn from the money from tourists, but also people will be informed more of Shivaji and his legacy. \n\nI voted for Modi in 2014, it was the very first vote I cast in my life, I voted him because he promised development, I didn't care about Hindu Nationalism, I wanted the promised development and the 'good governance' that the party projected in their Manifesto. \n\nNot only this they are giving reservations to Marathas, now it will total 71% in MH. 71%. Imagine that. Ambedkar must be ashamed of the disgusting vote-bank, caste, religion appeasement politics that today's politicians are doing. \n\nSpeaking of reservations, if you look at the chapter of schedule caste and schedule tribes in the constitution, you will find it talks of reservations only in context of, and I am using constitutional language here, 'proportional to the percentage population in state legislative assemblies.' This means that it talks nothing about reservation in education and govt jobs. Ultimately, one has to decide how much erosion of competency in our education and bureaucracy we can afford.  "
"Erecting statues in the name of tourism is the stupidest thing ever for a country like India. \n\nI can't imagine any Maharashtrian would think building this statue is a justified use of all that money when there are so many other issues faced by the state that could be resolved at a fraction of that cost."

"I have some problems with it, like OP mentioned, it's way too costly and those funds can EASILY be allocated to other areas like education, sanitation, infrastructure etc. \nBut another thing with the other iconic statues are - they are symbols of the country as a whole. Eiffel tower and statue of liberty does not celebrate one man or women, they celebrate the idea.\nShivaji was an amazing ruler (I am a born and bred Punekar, so I know). But a statue of him does not represent an idea, it represents a person more."
'"I get that monuments such as these can be really iconic. Many countries are identified by their significant structures."\n\nYes, India already has one of the [top 5 most iconic buildings in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal#Tourism) - IMO. Perhaps the fact that it was built by muslims diminishes its worthiness among certain political thinkers?'
'Why is it that I always hear things like "I am a marathi manus", "Aamcha Maharashtra","Jai Maharashtra" in a very proud tone. Like I get it that people are proud of being a Marathi. But this trend, I don\'t see in other parts of India like, "Oh I am a Madrasi or I am a Manipuri". \nPeople are fond of Shivaji Maharaj but not rest of the populace of India who connect equally with their local heroes be it Ashoka the Great, Maharana Pratap, Tipu Sultan or KrishnaDevraya.\nShowing favouritism to one great icon by means of spending a whooping Rs.3,600/- crores is unjust. There are so many other things govt. needs to focus on.\nOnly silver lining that can be seen here is that this will generate some employment for setting up the statue. And hopefully without kickbacks.\n'

Raigad the Long Term Capital of Maratha Empire & the most famous Fort in Maharashtra does not have basic facilities like toilet, drinking water place to stay. The condition of other forts is even more bad. But the BJP state govt. is busy building statues to show-off.'
'I am surprised at the number of people believing that 3600 cr would be spent on JUST a statute. The memorial includes a whole lot of other things.\n\nNot in favor of this decision, but a debate only starts when facts are objective.'

"Personally, even though I can afford one, I feel all phones over 20K are not worth it (unless they have something really really groundbreaking which is extremely rare). \n\nIf all you're going to do with your phone is use WhatsApp, social media, click pictures, browse reddit, etc, a phone around 10-15K with a 1080p display, 3-4GB of RAM and a decent enough processor like the Snapdragon 6 series should do well.\n\nCurrently, I use a Redmi Note 3 which I purchased over a year and half ago for 12K. Has almost every feature I'd expect from a smartphone (except for NFC but I rarely ever needed it). Never faced performance issues ever and the battery lasts over a day and half with the kind of usage I have. I do quite a bit of multi-tasking between apps. The camera isn't the best in the world but it still clicks decent pictures.\n\nMy gf owns a OnePlus 5. Obviously her phone has better and more features as it's almost 3x the price. But I don't regret not having those on my phone.\n\nOne reason why anyone would vouch for a high end phone is probably gaming (something I'm not really into on mobile devices). My phone isn't the best for gaming but it does play quite well.\n\nI'm ready to replace my phone with something better but I didn't yet find anything compelling enough to spend that amount of money on. My current phone is doing really well for what I paid.\n\nI'd rather save the money for other stuff I need.

'If you wish to give Apple a try, buy a couple of generations old iPhone (if using a supposedly "outdated" phone doesn\'t bug you much). The price-tag is justifiably in a lower range, you\'ll continue to get latest iOS at least a couple of years from your buy date, and the phone is not as behind feature-wise from the Apple flagships. \nI bought a 5S for 20k after the launch of 6S. I wanted a smaller phone, so that worked for me. I did not miss much except for the 3D touch & tad higher digits on device specs. And, I\'m getting iOS 11 later this month. Been 1.5+ years and the phone works as good as the day I bought it. \nI\'m planning on doing the same with pixel, to buy the first generation device after Pixel2 is launched later this year. The only downside of doing this with an Android phone is their shorter guaranteed update durations (up to 2 years max).'

"I used IPhone 4 for a few years, switched to Motorola X2, and back to 6 plus. \n\nFrom IPhone 4 to Android was a refreshing change, I especially liked the flexibility and freedom to literally do what you wanted with your phone. But after a while I began finding Android to be too messy. \n\nSwitching back to IOS was actually great for me. I have a solid collection of apps built over years of using an IPad, and my family uses IPhones too so family sharing is another good thing. I like the synergy and ease of use in IOS, especially integration with Mac. \n\nUltimately, your choice of phone depends a lot on what ecosystem you're embedded in. Apple is a bit overpriced, but you're already paying a lot for any flagship phone. At that stage a bit more doesn't really matter. \n\nI'm happy with my IPhone 6 atm. Great battery life, great for my productivity. If I change my phone, I'd prefer the IPhone 8. Or 9, ie 8S when it launches. And, I'd hope to use it for years. Even 4 years is about 25,000 a year, ie 2000 a month. Easily more than I spend on beer. "

'50k or something like that.'
"> One reason why anyone would vouch for a high end phone \n\nIt's probably the flagship level features and support. Having also used the Redmi Note 3 i've always felt the camera was lacking, the flagship models spend more into the features on the phone so you know you're getting the top of the line specs whether it be Waterproofing and Wireless charging or 5 year software support. "
"Completely agree with you. I too have an aversion to spending laptop money just on a smartphone. But, the Mi Max 2 seems like a good bet even though it exceeds our 15k ceiling. The screen size sort of makes it a hybrid phone-tablet and saves buying a separate tablet particularly if you're inclined to reading a lot on the move. So, considering that I'd say 17k is the maximum I'd be willing to spend on a phone"
"IPhones don't drop in price till the next one comes out."
"Why though? Depends on what you use your phone for. \n\nWhile Android is a technically superior OS, standby battery life is still an issue even with Doze. And while iOS doesn't really have real multitasking- it remembers app states better. \n\nAlso many people are limited by the apps that they want to use. Snapchat on Android is still horrendous. I'm limited by work apps and can choose between Motorola, Samsung, LG and Apple. The work apps are also better on iOS than Android. \n\nIf it's the cost factor - Android flagships are nearly as expensive. I agree that iPhone X is ridiculous at $1000 but the Galaxy Note isn't far behind. Any way it's their money to spend. "

"good post. converse is also true. just as the very things you talked about that you learnt from indians are important in life, it's also important to be your own person, responsible for your own life. it's important to take up challenges and win and excel at it. it's important to have some form of self-centeredness where you don't sacrifice your own happiness all the time for everyone around you. truth be told, these qualities do represent polar ends and it's probably good to be comfortable with mixing and matching these qualities to enhance your life. \n\nthere's racists among indians too who dismiss americans as being self-centered and a bit clueless about the rest of the world to the point of being stupid. not untrue when looked at from a certain lens. but there's tons to admire about americans too (and only americans. not even europeans). if i have to pick one thing, it is the ability of americans to do something with such great passion and work so hard for it that they end up making a science out of it and start defining the standards. very few indians do this sort of a thing.\n\nlet me give some examples. take a look at english sports vs american sports. american sports may have derived from english sports, but americans were the ones to develop a sport science around those derived sports and drive it to levels of professionalism previously unthinkable. this got re-exported back to british sports like cricket and rugby around the 2000s. there's a stark difference between pre-2000s british sports, which mostly looked rather amateurish vs post 2000s british sports.\n\nanother example is weed. india has smoked weed for many thousands of years. yet it is seen as a random intoxicant that has been banned. you just get generic stuff in india with hardly any well known strains. but in the US, there's so much of breeding tech applied to it to the point where there's a HUGE difference in quality between strains developed (and being developed) in the USA vs the stuff you get in India.

I also love that you interacted with people and saw their lives and voices from the inside, as opposed to just seeing things from a distance.\n\nAs an Indian living in USA, I have also experienced positive and negative aspects of American society which has given me a lot to think and learn about. It really varies from person and person, and to me, the idea of individual liberty, personal expression and private space as a sanctuary gels well with me (these being the differences), and I think, in terms of thinking in new ways and challenging the status quo, or at least enjoying the debate, is what I really find similar between the two cultures. We love debating.\n\nOn a side note,\n\n> The earnestness with which my co-workers asked about my marriage, my plans, my happiness, never ceased to amaze me.\n\n:)  '
"The self-centered nature you talk about is actually more aptly explained by collectivism vs. individualism. Asian cultures work together whereas european/american cultures work as individuals. I'm  Indian but calling it self-centered is a little unfair. \n\nAs for patriotism, India is very jingoistic. You just didn't come across it. Most likely because an Indian in America or anywhere outside of India will tend to keep their more controversial opinions to themselves. In fact, there are factions of India who applaud the anti-muslim rhetoric that has taken hold in America. To summarize just like America or anywhere else, there are good and bad people. And you met the good.\n\nAgree with everything else and enjoyed reading your opinion from the outside."

'Sense of community is sometimes claustrophobic when certain roles are enforced on individuals whether male or female in the blind name of community. Im sure youve seen this also. Its pretty universal. The spectrum of family life that exists in india also accounts for large numbers of people giving birth, not because they want to have kids, working ungodly hours, not for personal fulfillment or even financial enrichment but to blindly satisfy familial expectations. Again, this is a spectrum. \nIm sure having people concerned about you has a certain novel aspect to you in your own life, but im sure there are many americans also who have family systems that are similiar to the indian system that you hail so well. \nNow, specifically, in your case, a theory could be that just like any 9-12 year old indian child,all these family values appear only in terms of communication and theory. In follow through, trust me, generations of institutionalised abuse and bullying are also hidden away in many families. \nThey enquired about your marriage. Try marrying one of the relatives of the enquirers. This would be litmus test on how much they want you tp be part of their family past the usual attempt to be politely friendly. \nAlso, being politely friendly in india may be a lot more intense in India than in America. More inhibitions, ya know?'
"OP, with all due respect, but you are incredibly naïve. I'm happy for you that you enjoyed your time there, and apparently they enjoyed you being there as well, but this entire post reads like fiction to someone who knows anything at all about India.\n\nYou speak at great length about intolerance, but the sheer amount of misogyny which exists in India is shocking. [80% of women in India](https://scroll.in/article/829205/80-indian-women-need-permission-to-visit-health-centre-5-have-sole-control-over-choice-of-husband) need to seek permission to go to a health center. Only **5%** have any independent saying in who they choose as a spouse.\n\nIt is in this context where your attacks on individualism comes across as sheltered, myopic and, yes, out of touch. Just keep in mind that many women would *kill* for having some individualism in their lives. \n\nHomosexuality is banned and deeply frowned upon.\n\nThere's plenty of racism in India as well. Try taking a black friend to India and you'll come to see Alabama or Mississippi as a hippie paradise. And I haven't even touched on blatant casteism, which is a unique Indian curse.\n\nYou slam individualism, but as I pointed out, if you're in the 95% group of Indian women who can't completely independently choose their own spouse or 80% of women who need permission to go to a heath center, then your rant frankly comes across as 1st world problems. It feels to me like you have it in for American culture and you're just seeking an outlet to bash it. Most of the people you worked with were most likely upper-caste brahmins who belong in the 95th percentile and are some of the most Westernised Indians. They're not representative at all.\n\nBut believe me, if you spent some time on the ground here, and actually looked at how more vulnerable groups are being treated, you'd laugh at yourself for writing something so utterly naïve. It's somewhat understandable since you never visited India, but then you should also refrain from dishing out opinions comparing your own country, which you obviously resent, with a country you know next to nothing about. You should have the insight to understand this, but apparently you don't.\n\nObviously this will be an unpopular opinion in this sub, but I couldn't help myself sighing and rolling my eyes as I read the text."

">The last thing I'd like to point out is the difference in Indian patriotism when compared to Americans. Today, American patriotism revolves around the idea of superiority, whether through morality, wealth, or force. Americans simply like to be better than other people. The founders of our country are revered today not because of their teachings, but because they are seen as having fought tyranny and won. When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments, but for how they taught India new ways to think.\n\nUnfortunately, this has changed in the present day and age. Patriotism and nationalism in India is seen in a similar manner as you say Americans do. I understand that you have a bunch of right wing loonies in the state who believe that the US is exceptional in the world and the best. While we in India can't really claim to something like that, we have a bunch of our own right wing loonies who accuse western (aka American) culture of being corrupt, of family values being lost and generally as Indian culture being superior due to its..I dunno..vibrancy, heritage..history..or some other crap.\n\nIndian patriotism these days is not really about different ways of thinking, but instead, avoiding talk of our flaws and dressing up our culture and way of life (which can be really backward and primitive sometimes) as superior."

"Honestly the only real barrier for me was curry. I don't like the smell, and if there's one true Indian stereotype it's that you cannot escape the curry. Once my colleagues actually got me to try some curries, though, I LOVED it! I cook with it all the time now and a nice spicy vindaloo with naan and basmati and homemade vegetable samosas is a meal I make at least once a month."
"I can bash some stuff if it'll make it better for you. Indian people wear pointy shoes! And smell like curry! How's that? ;)"
"I agree with your first point for sure. I'm a better person today for having been exposed to both cultures, and while neither is perfect, it is easier to find deep criticism for what you know well. I was lucky enough to be surrounded by people who wanted to put their best foot forward and who loved India, so they shared their love and passion with me rather than their grumbles, and I quickly became acquainted with some of the better parts of Indian culture.\n\nI also agree with your last point, and I cannot even begin to tell you how relieving it is to live in a state that has finally legalized. Today I don't have to fear eviction and prosecution for smoking, and a year or two from now I'll have access to crazy amazing dispensaries. Vive la révolution!"
"FYI, you can make sacrifices and be happy at the same time. If only you believe in our values. Many people sacrifice their selfish interests and are happier than they would've been if they were more selfish.\n\nRegarding the science part - completely disagree that it's a culture thing. It has more to do with education and poverty levels. You can see how good Indians can get at what they're doing by seeing how good they are at corruption and organised crime. It will probably beat any Western system out there in the level of complexity and ingenuity. If only there was safety of subsistence and motivation other than just amassing huge amounts of money, the same aptitude could've been used for something more productive."

"I'll have to see if I can find someplace near me that serves it, or make it myself. I love cooking."
"There are positive and negative aspects to literally any system, but I appreciate you telling me about some of the less well-known issues. My colleagues actually did share a lot of their frustrations with me, as well as their admiration for aspects of American culture. I feel I got a pretty informed perspective, but I didn't want to focus on negatives. I don't revere India's social infrastructure, but I learned from it and those I've met. What I posted about here was what I observed of my colleagues at work, at home, at worship, and in joy and tragedy. It's not a complete picture, but it's part of the large mural of India that I was fortunate enough to really take in."
'Like anything, your mileage may vary. I may have just been lucky, or it may have had some to do with the corporate culture nurturing these attitudes. The company I worked for had a lot on offer for personal development and improvement.'
"There's just one point I'd like to say here...\n\nIf OP had dissed India? People would've JOINED him. Yes. People ITT would've JOINED him in doing so. I've seen it myself."
"I'm sorry you're coming at it from that perspective, but I think you may be bringing some of that with you. I know for me, I looked up to many of the Indian men and women I worked for as examples and mentors. We respected each other, and that's really what's important. I met Indians who were petty or rude or inconsiderate, but not many and I chose not to focus on the negatives with my post.\n\nI'm picking up that this is a point of frustration for you, and am not naive enough to tell you how you should feel. Just try to keep in mind that the world is a big place. We have 1/3 the population of India and I'm still learning about how radically different Americans are from each other.\n\nI hope you take my comment as it's meant, as explanation and an attempt to understand, rather than condescend. Have a good one."
'Please act nice, spread love, and be civil and gentle in this thread, brother.'
"Dude if someone compliments you, why don't you just appreciate and be a little happy? \nWe are not saying everything is perfect here. So if anyone appreciates something\n good, why not take a moment to be happy? \nPeople these days don't know how to take a compliment. "
'I agree to this. '
"What you don't understand is OP dealt with mostly Indians who are a part of the urban population. The issues you mentioned are (mostly) rural. Even though some people who may be misogynistic and have an irrational train of thought may be a part of the urban community as well, I believe that's true for all nations. OP is quiet accurately describing interactions you would have with an educated individual belonging to the urban population of our country. Don't let negativity bring you down u/SquatchHugs.

'I loved this ad. '
"One of the best ads I've watched."
'Does anyone know what is the original song this one is based off on? Or others with similar style?'

'Clients eager to experiment? What timeline are you from??'

'yep that was the one, the one u sent is hilarious too.'
"Lol I wish my friends weren't that into consumerism. Urban kids are all about brands these days. "
'>\rGood luck happydent fanboy!\n\nIs this a trend now, you say something in support or againts somebody or something and people deckare you a fanboy. '
"Don't you think people's attention spans have changed, and brands have to keep that in mind as well? Do you also think that the research that supports it is bullshit? Is there research to prove otherwise? I just want to know your opinion. I remember talking ads with you long back!\n\nI completely agree about clients not taking risks. Original ads from India are far too few."
'So how do brands like Volkswagen manage to produce memorable less in your face ads even in the recent past? What is their marketing department doing differently? '
"Because such creativity doesn't sell the product?\n\nA creative advert is for advertising awards. One which hammers the brand in the mind, though it could be drivel, is for clients. The twin objectives rarely coincide. "
'You aren\'t getting it. One doesn\'t simply sell the idea to the client. The clients are a lot more demanding these days. They don\'t care what the agency says, or recommends. They believe that they know better. And that\'s the reason why "most" ads on TV are boring and annoying.'
'It has most definitely changed. There was a time when we would do 1 minute long TV ads. Now 30 seconder is the norm but a lot of clients are looking at 15 and 20 seconders. That gives the agency very little time to tell a story, that\'s only enough time to talk about a problem, then the brand as the solution and how it works etc. The thing with a 15 seconder is that you can play it more number of times on TV than a 30 seconder since it costs less and you can play it for a few extra weeks. So clients are looking at ROI very thoroughly and not ready to waste money.\n\nThey may run a longer version of the ad on digital, but no one really watches them. Why would anyone want to watch an ad online?\n\nMarket research used to be something that the big companies like HUL and ITC and others believed in, now every client wants to do it, to be on the safer side.\n\nSo at the research, if a focus group, opines that they don\'t exactly "like" something, let\'s say the music, or don\'t pick up on a particular word, then the clients ask it to be changed. It more often than not kills the idea, the script and creativity.\n\n'
'VW hasn\'t released an ad campaign in the last 2-3 years. They would do campaign frequently but they\'ve been silent for a long time now. The thing with VW is that it is a premium product and not a product for the "masses". The average VW is one who has refined tastes, he/she likes the finer things in life. So they cannot be loud and brash. They need to be classy or else they\'d be regarded as just another middle-class man\'s Maruti.\n\nIt\'s the reason why the country club ads are shit whereas an ad for a high-end service hotel like Hyatt or a premium holiday brand like Mahindra Club potray themselves as classy.'
"There are ads that win awards and also entertain people. The happydent commercial was one such ad. But in the last 5-10 years, clients do not care for creativity, they only want to talk about their product and its benefits. There's no storytelling, nor is there any creativity. It's become the shit that Bollywood was in the 90s."
">There are ads that win awards and also entertain people. \n\nLike I said, either of that isn't the objective of making an ad and spending money on putting it on media. Companies would rather have non award winning boring ads which increase their sales. Having all of it; awards, entertainment and higher product sales; is rare. "
"> And yet it is the 'creative' stuff like Happydent and the Fevikwik fishing one or even the Fevicol chicken egg or truck (which are like 20 years old now) that still stand out. \n\nThey may stand out. But did they increase sales of the product?"
'Ads are made to inform people, it\'s a form of persuasion that "may" lead people to go and buy the product or service. Or at the least have the brand in their consideration list. \n\nThe main difference between ads of 10 years back and now is that ads then were enjoyable and were persuasive by entertaining people. Right now ads seem to rely on hard selling and carpet bombing. \n\nPeople don\'t watch TV to see ads. They shouldn\'t be obtrusive which is what they\'ve become now.'

'1.6 lpm crowd = common man. Welcome to Randia.'
'Exactly. The common man would love for his son to go to the army, because at the very least, in rural areas there are hardly any opportunities for stable employment. The military takes care of its soldiers with pensions, health care, and other benefits that would normally be unimaginable to the common man. \n\nThis is why you get tens of thousands of people showing up to army and police recruitment rallies, even in areas like Kashmir. \n\nThis cartoon makes the common error of India\'s richest 1-2% thinking themselves as "middle class" when in fact they\'re the country\'s wealthy elite. And what the fuck, what common man can buy his son a seat in a medical college. This cartoon (the title at least) is idiotic. '
"Even then it doesn't justify the cartoon. Of course I know I can't go to army or won't cut it their therefore I respect people who do.\n"
"Yeah I think it really depends on the state and community. Some states view it as a matter of pride, especially if you're inducted as an Officer. Others see it as something you do when you have nothing better to do. It's less about socioeconomics imo."

'India is surrounded by various countries that wouldnt even think twice before attacking it. When a country invades, it doesnt give a shit about lives. People are brutally massacred. \n\nPresence of army helps keep the invading forces in check. And army needs personnel. \n\nWhy people join army? Well, one- to protect. Two- job perks and security. Army is one of the esteemed job positions. Not everyone is born with privileges and status, not everybody gets an automatic seat in a college or admission is future. Army is a good opportunity for them to get a secure job and raise their status. \n\nWhy people feel proud of it? Because it is tough job. One of the toughest job out there. Not to forget, they are protecting us from invasions. An army is very essential for the survival of india. \n\nNow why dont you give any argument? (Provided you have one)'
'It\'s not about dying for your country - its protecting what you, your family and people and their ancestors will and vision. \n\nThat sort of atheistic and nihilistic thinking was what led to invasions almost destroying our civilizations to be replaced with a more archaic and degenerate one.\n\nIf you don\'t want to live in a degenerate society, then you need a defense. \n\nYour counter at this point can be, "why can\'t a better society replace an existing one through violence?" It should not need violence if it\'s a better society.\n\n\nLearn from a history, don\'t fall in the buddhism trap. Indeed, it had all the qualities of a better society and even successfully replaced our at that point in time a archaic hindu one but also weakened us to the point that we could not defend ourself to even raiders, as it was too ideal. \n\nIt took Shankaracharya to reiterate that hinduism/vedic teachings has everything that Buddhism has along with the gumption and foresight to preserve such a society.\n\nYour opinion is heard, but the listeners need to show you and your opinion the door. Please learn from history.\n\nThey are not dying, but surviving to protecting what\'s more valuable. '

"What bullcrap is this?\n\nNot dying in warfare is neither atheistic nor nihilistic, not even Buddhist. None of those has got anything whatsoever to do with not wanting to die for your country. \n\nMy counter is not why can't a better society replace the current one through violence. My counter is War is Violence. War is not a glorious thing. What does the fact that we are so ready to kill other humans over some perceived trivial differences tell us about ourselves as a species? Are we truly the most exalted of all the species like we like to think about ourselves?\n\nWars take place, more often than not, to protect the interests and the ideals of the more influential and wealthier members of the society. And it is the poorer members, those without any political or financial clout, that die. Are the interests of the influential members really that valuable that others should die to protect those while they get to chill off at their private retreats?\n\nI do not want to live in a degenerate society. But the fact that we are still warring instead of building a united world without any political boundaries shows that we live in one."

It's just a dumb comparison. One, USA is a country; one of the biggest and most powerful in the world. I'm sure there will be more Indians who can name the states in the NE than the American states though. No, I'm not talking about NRIs, I know you hate NRIs :p I'm talking about Indians, in general. Two, if the respected Governor wants Indians to know so much about our geography, I'm sure he could set a good example by talking about what he knows about the South. That would be enlightening.\n\nPlease do not take this as a fact that I disrespect our culture. I love and respect certain facets of our culture and find much more peace in it, but you have to accede to the fact that there's many things about 'american shits' that has made our life easier.\n\nIf not for the said shits after all, you wouldn't be posting your thoughts on a forum like this. :p"

I'm not an attention seeker. I try to be an optimist but it never works. So,I try to hide behind others problems, try to give them solutions, try to help them out.

To billions of people in India and China, who probably don't count as a part of your one-sided 'world', it's sacred, and it will remain that way. Can't believe we now have Indians denouncing their own heritage and symbolism simply because of some event that happened in the 1940's that had (and still has) nothing to do with us. Would you denounce the Om if Kim Jong un appropriated it for NK?\n\n> still it is something vividly hated around the world.\n\nSo? Do you or any of us need approval from the rest of the world?"

'I\'m also a westerner.  Something about your post makes me uncomfortable... like you are seeing the actions of people, but only trying to interpret them through your own experiences and not really thinking about why these things might occur, given different realities of life in india vs. the west.  For the record, I also observe these issues you talk about (of people just doing what\'s needed to complete, only caring about getting paid).  And well understand the frustration it causes, collectively.  But I can understand this behavior why people do it, when I see there\'s some fundamental differences in life between the two places.\n\nI\'ve thought about it a bit recently, and like to share that with you, to give a different way of viewing it.  Maybe I am off base in my conclusions, but at least thoughts to consider.  First, how do we see work in the west?  It\'s my experience at least, that we grow with the main idea form childhood, "be what you want to be, you can be anything when you grow up, take chances and follow your dreams".  I enjoy that idea.  But the reality is there\'s more privilege to do that in the west (for the average person), than there is in India, because of less constraints from family/society, and social protections (if you fuck up and your dreams don\'t pan out, there\'s at least some protections from the government).  When you have spent your life viewing work from that way, it\'s a lot more natural to have \'pride\' in what you do.  In India, a lot of people are directed in to trades from a young high school age, for practical reasons, from family pressures, etc.  Did you know what you wanted to do with your life, when you were 16?  If you\'re shoehorned in to a career, find out later you don\'t like it, but feel little mobility opportunity, can you understand where it would be less likely to care about what you\'re doing?  And though I don\'t like that mindset as much, it makes a lot of sense why this is the mindset, when you think about it.  You are in India... you see the competition that exists, it surrounds you.  Would you want to take the chance to follow your dreams and be a painter if you\'re in Delhi?  Now what if all your family is against the decision, and you have the guilt of thinking it will impact them?  What if you\'re not from a rich family?  What happens if things go wrong and there\'s nothing to fall back on?  What if you\'re thinking of taking care of your parents and need a salary for that?  All I\'m trying to say here is, in the west we have a bit more privilege to look at work as something we aspire towards, and an opportunity to pursue dreams.   It\'s not that you can\'t do that in India, of course you can!  But there\'s inherently greater risk involved, and more perceived risks for those you care of, unless you\'re from a rich and liberal family..  I think India will get there, too.  Give it time.\n\nBeing a laborer in India is a whole different issue in and of itself. Can you put yourself in their shoes for a moment?  Can you imagine living that life?  You\'re doing hard labor, most people in the society look down on you, and you\'re faced with doing this day in day out the rest of your life to keep your family afloat?  The reality is, taking pride in what you do, going the extra step to perfect things has a cost for the person doing it, even if it\'s just additional time, additional thought.  I\'d probably be miserable too if that was my life, and over time, just want to get finished with the job as quick as possible.  I wouldn\'t be looking at it, as this great opportunity I chose, to create things and see that I\'m playing a role in society, I\'d probably be looking at it as, my goal is to keep my family from starving, this is the thing I\'m stuck with for the rest of my life with little room to do much else.  Not to mention most of society then treating me like crap and looking down because it\'s not seen as dignified.  Have you ever worked in a labor field?  I have.  I did take a lot of pride in my work.  But I eventually quit, too, and went a different career path, because it was miserably difficult and there were other options.  I can\'t imagine thinking it was my only option for all my life.\n\nI agree with you, that if you\'re working 10 hours a day doing something you hate and have no pride in, it\'s going to make for a miserable day.  I also agree, that if everyone has a bit more \'pride\', goes the extra mile, whatever, things all around work better.  But I can understand why these things happens, and just feel like a lot of this stems from the differences in how we look at work in our cultures, and those different ways of viewing work make sense given the different environment of both places.'
'Socially, India will take a long long time to come up. There is just too much cultural and societal pressures for many people to truly change. Everyone is worried about what others think.\n\n"What will everyone say if my son becomes a painter instead of an engineer or doctor? Who will marry him?"\n\n"What will our relatives think if they find out my son has schizophrenia/depression/anxiety issues/etc ?"\n\nIn this regard, the western society is far superior. Be whatever you want, do whatever you want, noone cares. If you have a mental disorder, go see a doctor/therapist and get it taken care of. '

'[I present you Aakar Patel(Amnesty India head) on Laxman](http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/vsPAWFHbBY0qbtA1oRveFM/How-the-middle-class-failed-us.html)\n\n> I will illustrate its cowardice and stupidity by addressing the middle-class’ mascot, R.K. Laxman. The cartoonist best represents their drawing-room certitude that the problem lies outside.\n\n> In this view, it is the politician who is vile and the system that is faulty. The corruption, the anarchy, all of that is inflicted on the middle class. They (“the common man”) are victims.\n\n> Laxman has sketched this cardboard caricature of India for six decades, with no penetration of reality.\n\n> Fourteen or so years ago, Laxman was interviewed by Bharatiya Janata Party leader L.K. Advani’s daughter Pratibha on television. The subject turned to caste. Laxman said he hadn’t noticed the caste of the person next to him at his\xa0Times of India\xa0office till the law on reservations was legislated. He had not bothered about caste, nor had it bothered him, till this time. It was the act of reservation that brought caste to his life, and therefore to his notice. A newspaper reporter asked him 16 years ago what he did when stuck in traffic. Laxman said he liked riding in his Ambassador because from it you looked down on the beggar. In low-slung modern saloons, he explained, the beggar looked down on you and that he found intimidating.\n\n> **It is remarkable that someone so totally oblivious to India, so insulated from its reality, is honoured as its chronicler. Laxman knows nothing about India.**\n\n> I said this one evening some years ago over a drink to film director and writer Kundan Shah. He disagreed with me. Shah said he remembered Laxman’s cartoon of an oil slick approaching Mumbai’s coast. Laxman showed a man from a petrol pump pulling his lead towards the incoming spill trying to pump it to his customers.\n\n> Actually, this funny visual illustrates what I mean. In this case, the villain adulterer cheats the unsuspecting public.\n\n> Writer Khushwant Singh said Laxman was worth three editors. I will dismiss this saying it is a reflection on his editors rather than on Laxman.\n\n> **The greatness of Laxman is that his pedestrian offering is perfect for his audience. It helps keep them in their cocoon.**\n\n'

"As a TV/Movie nerd I find the catalogue on Netflix India quite disappointing as of now. It's far better than other services (except maybe Hotstar, because of HBO alone) but by itself it is really pathetic. All I could find are cheesy rom-coms and B-list horror films, apart from a pile of movies I've already seen. I couldn't find *Parks and Recreation*, *The Office* or *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, which were some of the best shows on US Netflix. I was also shocked at the lack of *Arrested Development*, which is probably one of the most popular shows on Netflix anywhere in the world. Is there any news on when (or if) these shows will ever see the light of day as far as Netflix is concerned? I'm pretty sure that Parks and Rec (and perhaps the Office) haven't aired on TV in India yet."

"We are already paying ₹1500/month for 2mbps unlimited internet , and you want to spend another ₹500? NO! We have Tata Sky/Dish TV.

'Irish customer here, need more Bollywood on our Netflix. What are Indian Netflix originals like? '
'Are you guys going to improve your anime collection? Animax\'s selection here is awful (partly because I&B rules are too restrictive) and if Netflix offers variety comparable to say, Crunchyroll, I might consider grabbing a subscription. I couldn\'t care less about regular "mainstream" TV.\n\nAlso, usually BD/DVD versions are much better than TV versions because of a lot of fixups so that\'s something I\'d also like to see for shows that have been released in home media formats. This is one aspect where Crunchyroll sucks - they only release the TV versions, perhaps because of licensing.'

"This isn't going to end well... Every Netflix employee to create an unauthorized AMA eventually is fired.\n\nStill wish I worked there though."

"Hey! Thanks for adding downloading recently. Been taking a lot of plane trips and it's been great. \n\nAny idea why no one has the rights to Friends streaming in India? Could you guys get that? I know you have them in the US. Seriously, get all 10 seasons of Friends in India and your subscriber count will skyrocket. We're obsessed with that show.\n\nEdit: Also, any hope of getting Arrested Development?"

"No Godfather, No Cuckoo's Nest. So, yeah, will wait and watch a bit more. Hopefully you'll reduce your prices as well."

"> Stampedes are inherently caused due to panic, not infrastructure.\n\nHow far will you sink to defend the indefensible? I strongly advise you to visit bombay, and use that bridge at rush hour. Say 930am.  If you think, oh but this is just one, I suggest you visit curry road around the same time. Edit: and this is only tip of the iceberg. You want a thrill of a lifetime while standing still? Go stand on platform 1 in dadar at rush hour. If you aren't suicidal, I'd advice you to do that at off peak hour. You'll still be scared for life. End edit.\n\nDo come back and do an AMA on how stampedes do not happen because of terrible infrastructure. Do tell us how 99% of the people shouldn't use that bridge and just stay at home, since the bridge was meant to take only 1% of the crowd using it.\n\nHaving said that, this is not bjp's fault alone. Bombay infrastructure was overwhelmed decades ago, and it stayed decades behind because of political apathy from everyone across the political spectrum."
'As an engineer I must tell you that there\'s a thing called "factor of safety" in anything that\'s meant to bear loads. If the real life load is expected to be X, the actual load bearing capacity must be many times X. If a puny mob can bring down a bridge, do you really think it would hold up against a big storm? '
"My point is if the government had paid some attention and expanded the bridge - or build additional FOBs to ease the rush, this might not have happened. They had a long time to do this but they didn't.\n\nI agree stampedes are caused due to panic - but adequate infrastructure and crowd control can greatly mitigate the aftermath. And who is responsible for infrastructure and crowd control? The very government which somehow procures the money for a statue and a bullet train project, but they never have enough money to build a new FOB.\n\nThey could use all their resourcefulness and good ties with the international community to procure funds for infrastructure improvement - but they won't."
"So basically you are saying that the 100s of tweets that mumbaikars warned about for the past few years - are completely unfounded, and that its only the people who are to blame - and that the bridge was perfectly sized for the crowd it is expected to handle.\n\nDude, please be realistic.. i can see you love our PM, and his party - and I dont even want to make the claim that its BJP's mistake here (which it seems to be in large part) - but please dont say that the authorities were correct, and it is only the people's mistake.

'Salt.... regular salt that we use in cooking. \n\nChemically it is called as sodium chloride or NaCl2..\n\nWhen we were young, this salt was produced by evaporating sea water. That was the only source of getting salt and it was abundantly available. It was so cheap that even the grocery traders in Mumbai used to keep it unlocked outside their shop during night time.  \n\nBut in 1986 things changed. \n\nTata\'s approached Rajiv Gandhi government with a request to sell "Iodized Salt". They gave a reason that people in North Eastern state suffer from iodine deficiency and their salt with iodine will prevent all deceases arising from iodine deficiency. \n\nThe corporate lobbying worked. Rajiv Gandhi government BANNED human consumption of natural sea salt and made it mandatory to use iodized salt all throughout india. \n\nSince Tata\'s were the only iodized salt producers, they instantly created monopoly in this business. I hope you remember the commercial "नमक टाटा का.... टाटा नमक".\n\nThe ladies liked this salt because it was not getting sticky during monsoon like sea salt. A small quantity was sufficient to create taste etc. But price of Tata salt was almost 5 times the sea salt.    \n\nNobody knows the real story why Tata\'s lobbied to ban natural sea salt. \n\nTata chemicals had a huge chemical plant in Mithapur, Gujarat state. They used to produce tons of chemically induced salt as a byproduct in the chemical process. \n\nThis salt cannot be dumped in the landfill otherwise it would destroy farming land. Hence Tata chemicals had created railroad tracks to take this salt to the sea and dump it in the sea. \n\nNaturally, they were spending huge money in disposing this salt. Hence they followed the western ideology of creating iodized salt. \n\nWhen indian government changed the rules, Tata chemicals started making huge profit instead of spending money in disposing the salt.  \n\nBasically Tata chemicals followed the same suit from western countries. \n\nOver a period of time people started understanding bad effects of using chemically manufactured salt. \n\n1) The sodium content in chemically induced salt is very high. That is why even a small quantity was sufficient to create taste. Prolonged consumption of This salt created high blood pressure, stroke and heart attack problems.  \n\n2) To control this problem, people started taking medicines. As a result, business of pharmaceutical companies increased! Doctor\' business improved. Hospitals earned more money. \n\n3) Iodine level in the human body is a very delicate balance. If it is not within the limits then it creates thyroid problem. Generally speaking, Indians have a balanced iodine level and don\'t need extra dose of iodine.  \nBut with Tata salt, everyone was getting unnecessary extra dose of iodine. Result, people started getting thyroid problem, obesity problem and other issues. \n\n4) again, pharmaceutical companies made huge profits by selling thyroid medicine. The blood testing laboratories got good business, the doctors got good business and fitness centers got huge business (to control obesity). \n\nAll this because of pinch of salt that was controlled by the government regulation. \n\nIn US, people realized heath issues due to this salt and asked to lift ban in the sea salt. \n\nGovernment partially removed the restriction on sea salt. \n\nBut now the sea salt is available in US as a novelty with a premium price. It is dlmost 5 times costlier than the chemically manufactured iodized sea salt. \n\nThe point is, the sea salt which was cheap and abundantly available through natural sources, was banned by the government and after couple of decades, same sea salt is now available 5 times costlier!!!!\n\nThis is called corporate strategy and good governance.\nForwarded as received'

'Honestly, I really don\'t know. I\'ve subscribed to r/India for a while now, and it changed me from a BJP supporter to a Confused person altogether.. \n\nIf you\'d ask me; I think it\'s time for looking back at that age-old phrase that defines Modern Humans, "Nothing Lasts Forever" . Every single concept that humanity has ever created has had A Rising Age,  A Stable Age, and A Downfall. On this timeline, where does Indian Governance lie? Where does Democracy lie? These questions could go on and on...\n\nIf we answer these questions, then we\'ll probably get the answers we need, to solve all world Problems.\n\n(BTW, the stuff about rise, stability and downfall is based on the concept of rotational governance in Amish Tripathi\'s Works)'

'> On this timeline, where does Indian Governance lie? Where does Democracy lie? These questions could go on and on...\n\nI think now is the beginning of the downfall. But a lot depends on the economy in the next 2 years before the next national elections. But irrespective of the economy at that stage I think BJP will win that election easily. I think Demonitization has hit the economy too hard that it might take a decade to bounce back, and Modi would happily retire by that time with devoid of any responsibility or shame. And then with UPA coming into power, you shall see few more scams. The cycle continues. Such is the cyclical behavior of politics in India. '
'I agree with the most of it and moreover we need a neutral platform/sub where everyone can discuss openly putting forth their views not fearing of getting banned. I don\'t see that happening anytime soon, LWers will blame RW and vice versa and until then there is no remedy of this "confusion". Each one of us should hear both sides and with complete fact and figures instead of a particular statistc/figure which is in fashion these days, which is used just to serve one\'s own agenda. \n\n\nMoreover I think neither masculine nor feminine way of governance(society) will work today. There should be an amalgamation of both, taking out the positives and addressing most of shortcomings of both ways of life. Despite that, it wont be perfect but it will be much better than either of those.'
'I would give a fuck about discos but yes having eateries and malls open 24/7 would be a boon (*Day dreams about shopping at Big Bazaar at 3AM*)'

'Who parties at malls and eateries? '
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Mumbai can shop and party the night away: New bill permits eateries, malls to stay open 24X7** \n\n ______ \nIn a few months, restaurants, multiplexes and malls in the city can remain open till late or even for 24 hours. The condition: The establishments will require police permission.\n\nThe state government on Wednesday passed the Shops and Establishment (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Bill, enabling owners or shops, hotels, theatres and multiplexes in the state to keep their establishments open round the clock, with an easier process to get permissions and licences.This will mean malls, multiplexes, restaurants and even small shops can be kept open till late in the night, especially on weekends.\n\nThe management of such establishments can also take the required permission online.\n\nCurrently, shops have to be closed by 10pm, with a grace period of 15 minutes. Restaurants are to shut by 12:30am and 1.30am with police permission. Paan and cigarette shops have to pack up by 1pm and other commercial establishments by 9:30pm. After the new rules are enforced, however, shops and malls can remain open until midnight and management can keep restaurants and pubs open even later.\n\nChief minister Devendra Fadnavis said although the shops will have the freedom to work extra hours, they will have to seek police permissions. He said the norms to be followed will be finalised by the police, depending on the location and the area of the establishment. Fadnavis, while speaking on the bill when it was passed on Wednesday in the Assembly, said: “The permissions will be based on the areas and the locations and the police will decide on the timings based on repercussions on the law and order,” he said.\n\nThe government made it clear establishments will have to follow all the existing rules related to labour laws and make adequate security arrangements for women. “While offering ease of doing business, we have also ensured the interests of the workers are safeguarded. We have made provisions for strict monitoring of CCTV installation and mandatory night drops for women working the night shift. Establishments that fail to follow these provisions will face strict action,” labour minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar told HT.\n\nThe Assembly passed the bill late on Wednesday. It will now require clearance of the legislative council, after which it will go to the President of India as the subject is from the concurrent list. If it is not passed by the council owing to shortage of time as the session is slated to end on Friday, the government may think of issuing an ordinance with permission from the President. The entire procedure may take anywhere from three to six months.\n\nThe bill has been in accordance with the Model Shop Act proposed by the Centre to facilitate the ease of doing business. The sate government, however, proposed some changes in the model act.\n\nThe establishments will have to employ workers in three shifts and give them all the facilities if they are operating 24x7. The bill also makes it mandatory to comply with the existing labour laws and also have increased the leaves for workers employed in these organisations. Maharashtra has become the first state to implement the central government’s Model Shop Act, which puts an end to the inspector raj. The bill will enable 38 lakh establishments to either operate without licence if they employ less than ten workers or get online licences in case more than ten workers.\n\n“This will not only end the inspector raj but also will generate employment. Maharashtra has become first state to adopt the Model Shop Act and this will now pave way for other states to follow the provision we incorporated,” Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'In Bombay, many a good watering holes and night clubs are located in malls. '
"In my town in the U.S. (pop 600,000), there is a 24-hour restaurant near a theater, and for years that restaurant was the hottest joint in town from 10pm-6am. It was just your basic bog standard family restaurant, they had a children's menu and everything. But thanks to its location and the fact that it was open 24 hours, the night shift became incredibly popular, and the more people went there, the more popular it became."
'Bombay was running all night until the 1993 blasts and riots. That changed the landscape of the city. It is now a different time but one incident like that and we are back to pack up everything by 10pm.'
"I love it and I don't even live in Sobo, although I just moved here this year\n\nbar stock exchange is awesome"
'1pm is afternoon, 1am is nighttime. Surely, the author meant the paan shops can be open until one hour after midnight.'
'But their parties begin at 7:30.'
'Well, it\'s not like that always happens, and particularly not for what might otherwise seem like a random restaurant. This place didn\'t even serve alcohol, pretty much the only thing it had going for it was the fact that it had a smoking section, which at the time was becoming more and more rare. Yet it still inexplicably became the sort of place that celebrities would visit when they were in town. It was a good example of a crowd attracting a crowd.\n\nPlease remember that I\'m offering this example in answer to the question, "Who parties at malls and eateries?" That restaurant was unusual, and not everyone might have encountered a place like it. Obviously, the person I was responding to hasn\'t yet.'

"12:30, or 1:30 at max. Except the clubs in 5 stars of course. Well, what can be done? Delhi is humongous and you can't have such a big place in India not have proper police patrolling throughout the night, which would be extremely expensive. I was used to going to clubs at 12:30 or 1 am in Singapore on Saturdays because people party there till 4 or 5 am easily. Sad that we have such restrictions here."
">  I was used to going to clubs at 12:30 or 1 am in Singapore on Saturdays because people party there till 4 or 5 am easily.\n\n\nEven Calcutta clubs are open like 3-4, as are Mumbai's. Delhi is an exception, but at-least it's more reasonable than Bangalore I suppose.\n\n\n\n"

"My Punjabi is a little rusty but at the very minimum, he said he's got her details (passport, visa, and agent's (I'm assuming this means whoever tricked her into the job in the first place, not sure on this) details with where she's staying after turning to Facebook to get information on her) and sent it off to the relevant authorities (along with the deets of about 7-8 other guys who've asked him for help as well). Pretty sure that authority is the minister of external affairs linked up in this thread. He says she'll be rescued and be home very soon.\n\nIf you want a complete translation, I can try later (on my phone ATM).\n\nHopefully she and the guys all get saved, along with everyone else in that situation, even if that's not realistic.

You really think it\'s appropriate to talk about Saudi progress on a post about an Indian woman who\'s very likely being tortured and raped by these "progressive" Saudis. \n\nYou should ask yourself how many of these same Saudis think about a "progressive India"? Because I\'ve talked to Saudis online and the moment you identify yourself as Indian they\'ll go after you with the \'send bobs\' and the \'milk truk just arriv\'. \n\nThey literally think their Wahabbism, their stoning of women, and niqabs make them better than us.

'>Bhaghat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol, the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name. Innumerable songs grew about him and the popularity that the man achieved was something amazing.\n\n\nNehru on Bhagat Singh'
'As a kid I admired him and his courage, it was only when I went to college and read his work that I really understood what he stood for. He remains one of the foremost personality that the Indian Left can be proud about. Oh only if he had lived to see an independent India, he would have been huge for our constitution too. Genuine thinker, this guy, at such a young age. Reminds me of Gramsci and his similar fate. Such sadness, dying for voicing the right concerns.\n\nWe would be fools if we think that the world is a better place today than then, for imperialism and exploitation has merely found newer means; instead of Pax Britannica, we have Bretton Woods world order.

They are just driven by "nationalism" pumped into their blood by political parties.'
'Most of the freedom fighters are being abused to suit narratives now. Now Savarkar and Golwalker are heroes while Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi are the villians. '
'I agree. His actions are noble and commendable, at the time, but did not have a long-term large scale impact, mainly because he was arrested and executed. If he had managed to escape he would have probably played a much larger role in the freedom struggle. '
"> Wasn't everyone fighting for the same thing at that point? They might have disagreed with the means at worst\n\nI'm going to get downvoted for this, but while we can and should respect Bhagat Singh and others for their bravery, you cannot idolize them without being hypocritical. \n\nSaying Bhagat Singh and Gandhi were the same and just differed in their means is saying the Kashmiri militants and the guy holding an Azadi banner are both the same. Kashmiris may have a grievance (legit or not is not the point here), but one holding a peaceful banner cannot be equated with another who blows up people in the name of jihad. "
"He didn't advocate individual terrorism in his later life. One of his final writings clearly states that-\n\n*I am not a terrorist and I never was, except perhaps in the beginning of my revolutionary career. And I am convinced that we cannot gain anything through these methods. One can easily judge it from the history of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. All our activities were directed towards an aim, i.e., identifying ourselves with the great movement as its military wing. If anybody has misunderstood me, let him amend his ideas. I do not mean that bombs and pistols are useless, rather the contrary. But I mean to say that mere bomb throwing is not only useless but sometimes harmful. The military department of the party should always keep ready all the war-material it can command for any emergency. It should back the political work of the party. It cannot and should not work independently*"

"Today, even dickheads like Virendar Sehwag are tweeting out Bhagat Singh as their heroes.\n\nBhagat Singh was killed for a reason. His ideas were so much radical, refreshing and influential. More than Gandhi. In some pockets of the nation during WWII such as Satara, we had freedom fighters running parallel governments. [Nana Patil founder of Patri-Sarkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Patil) and [Captain Bhau of Toofan Sena, the armed wing of Patri-Sarkar](https://ruralindiaonline.org/articles/captain-elder-brother-and-the-whirlwind-army/). Gandhi's role is often exaggerated.\n\nEven the elite of Congress did not staunchly oppose Bhagat Singh's sentence because his thoughts were radical for them. He's the finest of our heroes."
'You know, the people you describe as "just driven by \'nationalism\' pumped into their blood by political parties" may similarly have profound perspectives and complexities beyond what our current narrative would have you believe.\n\nNot everyone is an empty husk, hollowed out and shaped by some political agenda.\n\nEdit: While many of his supporters may not know these details about him (I didn\'t until today - and it only deepens my respect of the man), that doesn\'t mean they\'re wrong to praise him.'
'This is actually a reaction to the actions taken in past, similar to polarisation and reverse-polarisation discussed in context of UP election.\n\nPrevious Congress governments always tried to downplay any freedom fighters other than Nehru and Gandhi. Same thing is repeating now as Savarkar and others being projected more.\n\nMain thing everyone forgets that these were humans and men of their time. They had their mistakes, sometimes wrong or misplaced thoughts. But that does not make them villain, equally for Nehru/Gandhi/Savarkar and all others. But this never gets stressed enough.\n\nBJP supporters "like me" and many others agree to greatness of Gandhi and Nehru and their importance in freedom struggle and in the nation building, idea of India. But any moment you try bashing other freedom fighters (what ever path they followed for freedom) including Savarkar, for any of the issues, ignoring other better things, you will be bashed back in equal force or sometimes more.'

'At the macro level incidents like the Kakori robbery and the assassination of a few British officers had little impact on the ability of the British to administer India and more importantly gather tax and other revenue. Things like the Civil Disobedience movement actually disrupted these things and would have eventually made India unviable as a profit center. '
'Thanks for the quote. I found the full article [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/bhagat-singh/1931/02/02.htm), titled *\'To young political workers\'.* I thought you were suggesting that his regret of \'violence\' was a denunciation of his methods of struggle and an indication of his endorsement of \'Gandhian methods\', which is what surprised me. But he positions himself starkly in contrast to Gandhi and the Congress. He is clearly advocating a Leninist method of working toward a revolution organized through a vanguard political party. I can\'t understand why the communist party of the time would disapprove of him. Did M.N. Roy or others communists of the time write about him?\n\nThis article has lots of quotable passages, and for those who haven\'t read it, here are a few samples:\n\n>This [the one led by the Congress] is a struggle dependent upon the middle class shopkeepers and a few capitalists. Both these, and particularly the latter, can never dare to risk its property or possessions in any struggle. The real revolutionary armies are in the villages and in factories, the peasantry and the labourers. But our bourgeois leaders do not and cannot dare to tackle them. The sleeping lion once awakened from its slumber shall become irresistible even after the achievement of what our leaders aim at. After his first experience with the Ahmedabad labourers in 1920 Mahatma Gandhi declared: "We must not tamper with the labourers. It is dangerous to make political use of the factory proletariat" (The Times, May 1921). Since then, they never dared to approach them \n\nand\n\n>Now allow me to state the case in the simplest manner. You cry "Long Live Revolution." Let me assume that you really mean it. According to our definition of the term, as stated in our statement in the Assembly Bomb Case, revolution means the complete overthrow of the existing social order and its replacement with the socialist order. For that purpose our immediate aim is the achievement of power. As a matter of fact, the state, the government machinery is just a weapon in the hands of the ruling class to further and safeguard its interest. We want to snatch and handle it to utilise it for the consummation of our ideal, i.e., social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis. For this purpose we are fighting to handle the government machinery. All along we have to educate the masses and to create a favourable atmosphere for our social programme. In the struggles we can best train and educate them.\n\nand\n\n>We want a socialist revolution, the indispensable preliminary to which is the political revolution. That is what we want. The political revolution does not mean the transfer of state (or more crudely, the power) from the hands of the British to the Indian, but to those Indians who are at one with us as to the final goal, or to be more precise, the power to be transferred to the revolutionary party through popular support. After that, to proceed in right earnest is to organize the reconstruction of the whole society on the socialist basis. If you do not mean this revolution, then please have mercy. Stop shouting "Long Live Revolution." The term revolution is too sacred, at least to us, to be so lightly used or misused.\n\nand\n\n> At Calcutta, they [Congress] passed a resolution asking for Dominion Status within twelve months, otherwise they would be forced to adopt complete independence as their object, and in all solemnity waited for some such gift till midnight after the 31st December, 1929. Then they found themselves "honour bound" to adopt the Independence resolution, otherwise they did not mean it. But even then Mahatmaji made no secret of the fact that the door (for compromise) was open. That was the real spirit.\n\nand finally,\n>what difference does it make to them whether Lord Reading is the head of the Indian government or Sir Purshotamdas Thakordas? What difference for a peasant if Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru replaces Lord Irwin! It is useless to appeal to his national sentiment. You can\'t "use" him for your purpose; you shall have to mean seriously and to make him understand that the revolution is going to be his and for his good. The revolution of the proletariat and for the proletariat.'
"I don't think anyone is saying praising Bhagat Singh is wrong. I think the point is that a lot people who praise him might turn on him if they found out he was also an atheist commie."
'Oh, you bet! We need clear headed patriots like him these days, someone who can take up the fight against demagogues who the masses see as messiahs. '
"I've been reading on Jinnah partly because he is from the Khoja shia muslim community which i also belong. He is one of the most complex figures of the independence struggles. Once hailed as the bastion of Hindu-Muslim unity due to his role in bringing Muslim league and Congress together in the Lucknow pact: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow_Pact\n\nHe was already an amazing lawyer earning around 40,000 Rs per month in the 1920's so it wasn't for money. It was when in the general elections when the Muslim league failed to win any seats,even in the Muslim dominated areas that he was wary that for Muslims it will just be moving from English to Hindu rule.\n\nHis idea for Pakistan wasn't an islamic state but a secular state where Muslims had their rights not infringed upon(Look at how that went).He wasn't in power more than a year when pneumonia got him due to his heavy smoking. He drank scotch,ate pork,never prayed and most probably was an agnostic, rendering it ironic that such a person would head the creation of a Muslim state\n\n\nHe was a staunch negotiator and had India have a Jinnah, Pakistan would never have happened. In the end though, his theory of a country for Muslims of all different ethnicity from the Indian subcontinent  was flawed seeing how Bangladesh fell through. \n\nI am glad my forefathers never moved during the Partition though, seeing the plight of Shia Muslims there.Ironically if Jinnah was a politician or a lawyer in this time, he would've already been shot or bombed by those radicals.\n\nAlso Fun Fact: Nusil Wadia, the current head of the Wadia business clan and very close to BJP  is the direct grandson of Jinnah through his mother. In the video he talks about standing up to Congress's anti business regulations is owing to his Jinnah genes. Jump to the 3 minute mark for the direct context\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kILwr7EVOJw"
"you sure Jinnah defended Bhagat Singh in court? \nAFAIK, He only made favorable remark in support of Bhagat Singh's Hunger strike in Assembly.\nhttps://scroll.in/article/805568/the-man-who-goes-on-a-hunger-strike-has-a-soul-when-jinnah-defended-bhagat-singh"
'That\'s interesting.\n\nOn Jinnah, just recently came across the [claim that it was Hindu Mahasabha’s Savarkar (left) who propounded the theory of two nations (Hindus and Muslims) being split](http://caravandaily.com/portal/how-hindu-right-helped-propound-the-2-nation-theory-and-pakistan/), long before "Jinnah finally accepted it for Muslims after he witnessed Hindu nationalist tendencies emerging within sections of the ‘secular’ Congress as well".'

So India is undergoing a major crunch in cash availability. \n\nNow in some Indian marriages, gifts are usually given as cash.

"Jai Jawan Jai Kisan!\n\nHere is my 2 anna on why the war started. \n\nThe NDA gov came to power and truly wanted to improve the bitter relations with Pakistan which we had for decades. Vajpayeeji did something very brave which not any PM could imagine or have courage to do. That is go on a bus yatra all the way from Delhi to Lahore extending an olive leaf. Mind you this is very dangerous.\n\nHe did the yatra under very tight security and this was very well received by both the Bharatyi and the Pakistanis. Nawab Sharif was  extremely pleased with this great gesture and welcomed with loving arms. Everything is good so far. \n\nNow comes the Villan's role. Enter Pervez Musharraf.\n\nHistorically Pakistan's strong hold was the military. It controlled the country numerous times and is a very big influencer in Pakistan. No one can say anything against them or tell them what to do. Now Mushy after seeing the yatra became nervous. Agar Bharat aur Pakistan mei dosti ho jayageee tho we are out of business. So he did what military always does and took matter into his own hands. And told the army to infiltrate India without getting nawaz approval. Mind you this is show who the boss is. \nThe war started and Vajpayeeji was genuinely surprised. We had to fight a war which we eventually won. \nUnfortunately this didn't end but then kandar situation also happened in the same year. By this Nawaz was kicked out and Pakistan has come out to do what it is good at.\n"
'Remember remember, the massive intelligence failure.\n\nRemember remember, how the diplomats and politicians failed the nation.\n\nAnd nothing really changed\n\nAnd the armed forces had to sacrifice their best and brightest \n\nLeft behind widows and fatherless children to protect the nation\n\nWhile their leaders and Government officers hid their incompetence.'
'This is what I have read from Quora. The question was What ordinary people were doing in India when Indian army was fighting in Kargil? \nOne of the user wrote this and I liked this very much so that I want to share with you. The answer he wrote:\n\n>18 yrs ago when the Kargil war broke out I was living in New Delhi and recall like yesterday that the population on the whole was infuriated. No matter how much corruption was/is there in India but every Indian was united and doing their bit for the country. The commotion of being an Indian and to die for India was never felt by me and others around me ever before. I wanted to enlist without telling my parents but at the same time I was hearing news where military sources were saying that they do not need manpower but will appreciate getting funds from the population so the injured and martyrs families could be given a lot more than what the usual compensation from the government was.\n\n>I was asked by my mother to take some substantial amount of money to Defense ministry near India Gate. I forgot to put on my helmet which was just hanging on my bike. Near ITO I was immediately stopped by Traffic Police and I knew what curtailed now. Corruption always at its best. So I offered Rs 50 - 100/ to the cop to let me go without a challan, and the cop asked that I needed to shell out a lot more. I took out the whole bundle of money telling him that I have thousands in the bundle and he can take as much as he wants. He asked where was I going with that money, and I replied that I was taking it with me to donate to the Defense fund for the Kargil martyrs. I think the humanity in that cop got the better of him. He told me to go and put on the helmet and that he didn’t want to do anything to reduce a single paisa from the funds which were going to aid some martyr’s family.I reach the Defense Ministry Military command. There was a freaking 3 mile long line of young folks trying to enlist. yes.. 3 mile long. Even though it was 18 years ago I still get goosebumps to remember that. The country came together like never before. That was one of the proudest moments when even the worst public departments known for corruption, left corruption even if it was just for few months.'

'Even kargil was not a war in a traditional sense. For example armed forces were severely constrained by not crossing LOC . Hell even airforce was not supposed to fly across LOC. It was an  combing operation with Mig and bofors. \n\nInterestingly in the early stages of the conflict it was being referred to as a combing operation in news reports.'
"> They also had a legacy of US arms whereas most of India's weapons were from the soviets, so the Pakistanis had a better ecosystem of support\n\nIAF had Dassault Mirage-2000s and MiG-29s which were more than a match for the PAF F-16s patrolling the border, to the point that the PAF F-16s backed off in fear off being shot down and escalation. And better ecosystem of support? Mention PAF not being delivered Mirage V's due to France sanctioning them. "

It doesn't have the kind of training, resources, technical support which first world countries can buy. What it does with what it has, is nothing short of miraculous.    \n   \nI completely believe that the Indian military can withstand limited, and total war against Pakistan, and deliver objectives. However at a heavy cost. India vs Pakistan, is a meeting of equals, not like when US invades Iraq or Afghanistan and the entire country crumbles.   \n   "
'Didnt that clown IK Gujral dismantle our intelligence resources in pakistan just before?'
"From two different sources that talk about the same thing, I definitely think that Dutt did give away intelligence that could have resulted in a loss of life. \n\nIn Gen V P Malik's, From Surprise to victory, he mentions an incident where he warned Dutt that she had inadvertently tipped off Pakistan on the next objective of the Indian army, Tiger Hill. \n\nLt Gen Moninder Puri, in his book, Turning the Tide, graphically describes how Pakistani arty zeroed in on Tiger Hill, and he asked the CO of the unit conducting the attack to find out if Dutt was in the vicinity of the staging area or near the Indian arty positions covering Tiger Hill. \n\nShe was in the arty positions, so Lt Gen Puri had her removed from there and gotten into his HQ, where she was then asked to spend the night in the underground bunker. \n\nSo clearly, Dutt did give away the TH attack. \n\nThat said, both Gen Malik and Lt Gen Puri praised Dutt in their books for showing the Army in a positive light and in creating a positive outlook for them.

'All a social media data mining tool will do is help India become a dictatorship. So now, you can end up harassed for dissenting with the party in charge. '
'Data mining software doesn\'t work on Indian tax evaders who typically use other people\'s jan dhan accounts to store their own black monies. What a "social media" software will do is become a tool to harass legit tax payers, and at the same time will help wipe the treasury of those same tax payer\'s money for purchase of the said software.\n\nBullet Train is good, but not something that we need right now when we already have airplanes that cost about the same. There was also some news about a Japanese steel scandal a few days ago which also requires us to reconsider this project.\n\nThough they are not vanity projects, I consider them both to be unneeded at this time as the precious tax-payer money could be spent in far better ways.'
"Just my 2 cents... I feel bullet train is a positive step towards adopting a new technology and China wasn't in a better shape when they started building High-speed railways. Same was said for the cryogenic engine that was bought from USSR in the late 80s and later (almost 2 decades)helped us achieve major milestones in rocket technology (GSLV). So any kind of new technology inflow to the country should be rather good."
"I don't know man,I read about stuff in US or other countries where people posted pictures of themselves dong rich things online and were caught.\n\n\nAbout bullet trains,you also have to consider the spinoff effect that it ill have on our economy.Like creating and connection trade regions and ecosystems,manufacturing benefits etc.I consider infrastructure spending to be a smarter poverty alleviation scheme,better than welfare schemes.There's data on this on PM rural road building vs MNREGA.I haven't heard about the scandal."
'> I don\'t know man,I read about stuff in US or other countries where people posted pictures of themselves dong rich things online and were caught.\n\nLet me explain why it won\'t work in India. Indian IT Dept. checking social media for tax evaders is like them eating food by twisting the hand behind the ears. Why do they need social media when they already have the evader\'s bank account details? The kind of Indian people who post car pics on FB aren\'t those who get black monies in cash, these are usually the people who have all their bank accounts linked to aadhar and PAN, and the IT Dept. already know their bank details, hence it wont work here. It might have worked in US for some reason, but won\'t work here.\n\nThe kind of black money in India is systemic - the IT Dept and Indian Govt. already knows who all earn black money through the system. If they want they could put all of them behind bars overnight (but they won\'t do that as most of them are part of the system, and consist their vote banks too!). Trust me, if you go and visit an RTO Office, Sessions Court, Govt. Hospital, etc. you\'ll come to know how "transparently" these guys offer and accept bribes for just about everything, and part of the cut goes to higher ups in the system too. Now, how is it possible that the Indian Govt. doesn\'t know about this? Hence, all this talk about corruption, demonetization, data mining software, etc. is just a farce - if they really wanted to, they would have caught the perpetrators long ago.'

'HSR is old tech. I would be happy if the government invested in newer technologies - both tech being developed by foreign/private players, like hyperloop, as well as tech being indiginously developed by public sector organizations.\n\nGiven the amount of money we waste on defence (or to be more precise kickbacks for things purchased in the name of defence), this should be a no brainer. \n\nMake in India would actually mean something if it led to real technology development, rather than perfunctory assembly plants to satisfy some line item on contracts.'

'The reason for their reactions is the additional perspective of India the NRIs get once they go outside. It is like an introspection or a video analysis. In most cases they are not showing off or trying to come out superior. \n\nHaving grown up in India with all your memories/family/friends there, once you look from outside you tend to compare to it the place you are in. You see so much potential, So many little things that can be easily changed to make it even more wonderful. Then after you visit in between you actually see the difference in things that matter everyday, like healthcare, power, water, transportation, sanitation, law & order and other basic needs. Most of these also tend to rise from the huge population. Everyone is frustrated with the daily lives, are there to survive the large competition with large population in a smaller area and limited resources. I have had hardcore nationalist friends who went outside India and come back questioning all the things they assumed were wonderful, including their beloved Modiji.\n'
'Is it true that on /r/india there are more active NRIs than actual Indians currently living in India? Can any one confirm or deny this?'

People here are way more interested in trashing the country instead of finding solutions and implementing them. \n\nYou can really see everyday there is a thread which basically is "Why Indians are so worst" and "India will never change and always destined for failure". \n\nIt is like they are justifying their decision to go abroad with every piece of negative news. They almost feel a sense of joy out of misery of people here. It\'s OK if you want to go abroad and settle but don\'t trash the people who live here due to their circumstances.\n\nThis is by far, the most negative indian forum on the internet right now. Its not like Indian forums are beacon of intelligence, but once you realize that most people here are comprised on NRIs and 1.6 Lpm crowd, then discourse here starts to make sense.\n\nThe image of the people abroad is decided by the country, if you yourself are going to trash the country (without actually doing anything about it), it ultimately is going to affect you foremost. \n\n'

I do not deny that it has a lot of problems.\n\nBut I still want to be proud of our history, our independence, and our economic growth (although that is uncertain for the time being).\n\nBasically, I want to try to look at it in a nuanced way  - yes, India has a lot of problems - but IMO, being a realist with a goal for the future of India is better than being an eternal pessimist or an optimist."

Sometime back there was a post on reddit in r/india if I'm not mistaken, which mentioned a woman living in abject poverty and some news article about her, and it went on to say, that her 4 children were playing alongside her. \n\nAfter reading this the first thought that came to my mind was, well if you knew you were in such bad shape, why the effing hell did you have 4 children? \n\nThe reporters always want to mention the kids as a soft point of the story, so that the readers feel bad about what happened, just as this photograph wants you to. If it were just a construction worker, we see thousands of those everyday, (dont even get me started on the hypocrisy of women's day) but this image will gain popularity solely because of the kid. "
'Nope. They should ask the question "Why is the money concentrated in the hands of a few nepotistic communities?" and then do what must be done. People born into poverty aren\'t going to start offing themselves just because you don\'t want to have to exist on the same planet as them.\n\nIn every pre-industrial nation the majority of people were grotesquely impoverished. "Don\'t have kids" is just another way of saying "pretend you aren\'t human because I don\'t see you as human". Every developed nations has found ways to ensure that the number of those stuck in the cycle of poverty is dramatically reduced. Things like prenatal care for pregnant mothers, prevention of infectious diseases in the young and exposure to certain toxic products like lead during childhood, proper meals and nutrition for all children, state funded education tuition through high school, and grants to pay for university tuition and housing all have substantial impacts on the poverty rate. India needs to get its act together.'

They think the only way out of poverty is having a son, educate him and one fine day he will bring loads of money and make them happy. \n\n>Question is, are they intelligent/empowered enough to make that decision for themselves ?\n\nNo most of them don't. I have even seen some middle class families having three kids in this generation. We have no right to tell them. But if they are working so hard to even meet a square meal than I think they should think how many kids they can afford. Living a life without kids is a saddest thing for most of us. It is not empowerment it is the sad state of affairs in our country due to overpopulation. I have seen that a life carries less value in India than it carries in United states. \n"

"I am pretty sure it's not the first time"
'I was REALLY hoping this was actually some neta speaking that you posted with this headline as a joke. REALLY REALLY hoping, like for the sake of not just India but humanity.\n\nKali Yuga indeed.'
'I can respect Sunny Leone as woman with a career, even though that career is that of a pornstar. I think of myself as progressive but I just cannot wrap my brain around as to why the film industry is embracing her like this and why she is being idolized. We dont want more Indian girls in porn. If you dont agree now read this comment again after you are done fapping. Selling your dignity for easy money that too when she had no financial compulsions is not something we should appreciate and applaud. Almost all of us including me watch porn but that doesnt mean its a good thing. It distorts our thinking and supports an industry based on exploitation. The cons are a lot more than the pros. Since eradicating porn is not an option its best that just people with no other option choose porn as a career rather than the Sunny Leones of the world. \n\nAgain, read this only after you are done fapping and see if you agree. \n\nEdit: Please dont bring culture into this. And I said "we" dont want more Indian girls in porn because I naturally assumed most people dont want to see their mothers, sisters, friends doing porn.\n'

"Hopefully it'll encourage hot chicks in India to take up porn. I will have quality desi babes to shag on rather than foreign. This is what make in India should be about. "
"While this is amazing to see, I don't think this is truly her being embraced. I remember reddit drama on one of the porn subs where a well liked camgirl who did free shows copyrighted some of her private for sale videos. The same guys who were so welcoming of her suddenly became angry and started calling her a disgusting whore etc.\n\n\nWe can't mistake lust for mutual respect. A positive could be that this will allow men to be more open about their sexuality but nothing will change for Indian women who are not pornstars. "

'Which current indian actress would you like to see as a porn star?'
"I don't think she is doing porn in India yet. Also, there are plenty of B grade and C grade actress who have good following. At least in the south, it is kind of a thing. She has a lot of hype because she is an international star."
"Right! I wouldn't have expected Indians to ever look at her with anything but lust and disgust. It's good to see that she has been positively embraced by people in general and that there isn't the kinda backlash against her as one might have expected."

Both decide to just make a run for it.\nThe priest, running with his hands covering his genitals looks over and sees the rabbi running with his hands over his face. He says, “Rabbi! What are you doing?”\nThe rabbi says, "In my community, they recognize me by my face."'

"> Is it inconceivable then, that a strong rival to SP has a hand in this incident, to make SP look like the bad guys?\n\nAnything and everything is possible in politics, but it all depends on how the situation is on the ground level and whether or not the public services (such as Police) is in cohoots with these political parties or acts independently. In some other thread on /r/India, I've read that during the last few years, the Yadavs (SP supporters) have been gradually promoted throughout the Police cadres in UP since SP is ruling there. So, their inaction in this matter (preventing the assault on girl students across UP colleges) seems to be SP's blunder and not BJP's."

He did set foot in London but he couldn't even speak much english, he treated the jews barbarically and spent most of his time on the continent keeping the  angevin empire in tact and then went of to fight saladin in the lavant.\n\nactually he nearly bankrupted britain because of his campaigns.\n\nBut Chattrapati Shivaji actually had a positive impact on maharastra and it surrounding areas.\n\nWe have many heroes but none who match his stature and appeal amongst the masses. \n\nDid the British build these institutions from money they got from britain, did they smuggle it between their buttcheeks on the boats they came here on.\n\nNo, they took it from us. These vanity projects were just to make their time here more fun.\n\nI for one am glad we can so nonchalantly plaster over their wretched past.     "
'Lol calm down, what I meant was Shivaji himself would have been opposed to the idea of his name being used on a structure built on his land by the oppressors of his people. '
"Hence Victoria's name should be removed. Shivaji's Maratha empire has has more long-lasting impact than Victoria. Maharashtra whose capital Mumbai is has a heavy influence of Maratha empire of past. So yes the renaming to CST makes sense."
">No, he didn't. His kingdom was comprised of forts near the western coastline. Maratha empire conquered new territories after his death.\n\nJust google a map of the [maratha empire in 1674](http://www.speakingtree.in/blog/shivaji-jayanti-30-mar-2013). I'm not talking about after his death, if we include that the maratha empire stretched nearly the whole of india.\n\n> Not every fucking place though.\n \nMaybe not every place (Its not every place) but this specific place is apt. They exchanged the british monarch with our Chattrapati.\n\n>That is why Britain is referred to as colonial power. That is what all colonial powers do; they exploit.\n\nYa that was my point.\n\n\n>for one am glad we can so nonchalantly plaster over their wretched past.\n     \nTired cliche aside,  when i said plaster over their past i meant specifically by renaming the buildings they named. I am Not forgetting their colourful history here.\n \n"

The editor and publisher are bound to take due care and caution before making libellous statement,’’ said the court.\n\n>“The first duty of the law is to protect the personal reputation and to adequately punish those who falsely and maliciously attempted to destroy the reputation without legal justification. The person’s reputation is a property and if possible more valuable than other property,’’ the court ruled.\n\n>It further observed: “The complainant placed corroborative evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. On reading the article published in Lankesh Patrike it is per se defamatory and the language used…is defamatory and **it lowered the dignity and reputation of complainant**.’’\n\n>[**Reacting to the verdict, Lankesh said: “The court verdict is a temporary setback for me.

"And look at Bangladesh now. Not only has it passed Pakistan in Human Development Indicators like malnutrition, female labour participation, child mortality, fertility rate etc but it has surpassed India too. \n\nUnlike India and Pakistan, it has built a large and thriving manufacturing industry which is consistently growing as a percentage of GDP. [Here's a graph of that](https://i.sli.mg/vbOdsk.png). It's from their latest economic report, which can be accessed [here](http://bbs.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/bbs.portal.gov.bd/page/057b0f3b_a9e8_4fde_b3a6_6daec3853586/GDP_2015-16.pdf). Notice how large-scale manufacturing is dominating, too, which means formal manufacturing. Pakistan and India has a much larger share of informal, small-scale manufacturing with poor productivity. \n\nWhen Bangladesh was created, everyone bet against them. Yet here they are, outshining most developing countries. They are the Vietnam of South Asia. Job well done so far, let's hope they can keep up the pace for the next few decades. If they do, they will be an inspiration to the rest of  the poor parts of South Asia. "

"> Bangladesh's job market (specifically, large-scale industrial employment for low skilled people) sucks big time in relation to both India & Pakistan\n\nActually, their formal manufacturing is much bigger as a share of their economy than either India or Pakistan. They may want to migrate to India, but it isn't because India has a ton of manufacturing jobs. Also, some of those who migrate tend to be Hindus who are fleeing discrimination(although still a minority).\n\n> and the middle class wants to emigrate to the UK\n\nAnd the Indian middle class wants to emigrate to the West as well. Your point being?\n\n> Their GDP per capita is lower than both India & Pakistan\n\nNot as much as you think. They have posted consistent current account *surpluses*, which means that their currency has not depreciated, unlike India. The result? [This](https://i.sli.mg/vO3xX9.png)\n\nGNI is better than GDP since GNI is a measurement of national income. Not all of which that is produced in a nation stays in a nation. India's GNI is higher than that, but it isn't much higher, in nominal dollars.\n\nPPP matters for living standards, but nominal matters more for governments. Why? Because if you want to import heavy machinery to upgrade your industry, your PPP doesn't do anything for you. Higher nominal per capita does, however. \n\nFurthermore, Bangladesh has increased its exports two years in a row, like Vietnam. India's (non-oil) exports have declined.\n\nRemember, India passed Pakistan in the mid-2000s on a nominal GNI per capita basis. It wasn't until some years later that we started seeing the effect of that. India is still leading Bangladesh on that score, but for how many years? Nirmala is already hinting that she favours a rupee depreciation(when in reality, India's weak export performance is structural). Bangaldesh's currency has held steady against the dollar and exports have *still* increased. That's a sign of a competitive economy. \n\nAsk yourself, in 10 or 15 years, which country is more likely to be better off? A country who is rapidly industrialising(esp large/formal manufacturing) which already has better HDI indicators and is rapidly converging with India on GNI per capita or a country which has weak exports and has to resort to currency depreciation to stay competitive and is falling behind on HDI?\n\nBangladesh is not there quite yet, but it is amazing how fast they are converging with India and in some ways(HDI/industrialisation) surpassing India. The point here is not to deflect blame but to acknowledge that India's lead is not forever. Pakistan also thought the same in the early 1990s. "

And we know that the government is doing a good job when it wins elections, since elections are how the citizens let the government know whether it is doing alright. \n\nIn other words, if you want to know whether the current government is holding up its end of the bargain, you can look at the results of the next general election.

If you look at it from another angle, then along with that, couldn't it also imply that chances are girls will have people who listen to their complains but not boys? \n\nI think both perspectives are true.

This is after a careful reading of his own words, and not propaganda shit. The critical lens that you apply must extend to your heroes as well. \n\n\nPeople have ignored this and made it sound that he was concerned about Gandhi's health. One must wonder why a rationalist like Tagore, did not extend this concern every time Gandhi fasted. No such plea came during the Poona fast. And Tagore is not the one to mince words, He reprimanded Gandhi for saying God is punishing Bihar for the sin of Untouchability (Earth quake). I am in agreement with Tagore here, Gandhi used to do stupid things like this. \n\nTagore is less guilty of double standards than Gandhi"

I usually like and appreciate the change to the point where I become the one who suggests making those changes.\n\nSome things -\n\n1. The new notes have fully blank white borders of huge width starting from the edges. This makes it to feel like normal paper, and also since it is an abrupt color change, it doesn't transition well.\n\n2. Old one had more colors and designs. New ones are nearly mono color.\n\n3. Old note's text/object alignment was pretty standard. Like, main info(value of currency) at the center and corners. Other text at well thought out pattern. The new one has text just about anywhere."

And type two are poor and illiterate ones who live on wages and think that only a boy can feed them when they grow old. Nothing, but strict law enforcement can make type one fall in line but campaigns like old age pension for poor can motivate type two to contribute to the cause.\n\nSo I do agree that we should not dole out things for free but this one is a bit different than other subsidies to win election.

Maybe daughters aren't an unwanted curse, after all'. And that tiny shift in your mentality would effectively impact those associated with you in its own way.

"Snapchat has had two features so far, autodeletion, stories. It was only able to capture the young crowd of 15 year olds. They don't have as much buying power and are practically useless to potential ad revenue. There is a point to be made for long term public view.(getting them while they are young), but not a lot of companies like those market like that, huge companies that are concerned with brand image are the companies that maintain retail stores at times square despite losing a shit ton of money just to maintain brand relevance, and positive brand image. There is that kind of ad revenue but not nearly as much as others.\n\nThe kids are there only fit saying stupid shit that no one can hold them accountable for (autodelete) and more importantly to stay away from a platform like Facebook that their parents also use. So as soon as Snapchat gets the parents also, it's going to be another facebook, competing directly with it.\n\n\nYou can't compete with facebook, it has a humongous and varied user base, uses the best engineers to maintain an efficient business, and uses cutthroat business strategies like copying Snapchat stories onto Instagram, autoplaying videos to get that sketchy moolah.\n\nTill now I haven't talked about Evan speigal specifically, but his company and its practises are a reflection of his incompetence. Snapchat uses shitty tech to track users, not just to overblow numbers, but just shitty(one of their methods under reported, while another over reported). "
'>youth\n\nThis word has the same effect on me as the Scottish Play has on thespians. '
"While you have a point of pointing Snapchat's rival as Instagram or even other social media platforms, the company Snap doesn't really believe this. They call themselves as a Camera company and not a Social media company at all. Snapchat, their product, they want to portray this similar to a TV, and in terms of advertisement revenue they are on a very different model, one of the major differences is they do not have any links going out of their medium, that is they don't cross link to external links, hence the metric where other companies work on by seeing the spike in visitors to the links, and other analytics, it is not so in Snapchat's case, it's like television marketing, where advertisers believe what metrics Snapchat tell them (this is arguable, and could have more to talk about). Second, Snap's second focus has been Lenses, which is completely different from Snapchat's business. \n\n\nI'd say more, but I'm typing in the phone.

"'Murican here.  (I find Indian culture pretty interesting, and I like learning stuff about it from you guys.  So, hiiiii!  Also -- posting under a new account because I don't want my woes tied to my usual account.)\n\nI can't speak about the specifics of Ian's health plan, but my health plan has co-payments and doesn't cover all expenses incurred when sick.  For example, a few years ago, I became unexpectedly ill.  I first visited two general practitioner physicians at US$25/visit and one urgent care physician at $50/visit.  I had an ultrasound at $300 and an MRI for $2000.  My insurance deductible was $2500, so all of that came out of my own pocket.\n\nIt was eventually determined that I needed surgery.  Fortunately, it was a surgery that could wait to be scheduled because I didn't have enough sick time saved up to miss work.  I couldn't afford NOT to go to work while I recovered (no work = no pay), so I couldn't schedule the surgery until months later (after I accrued more sick leave).\n\nDelaying surgery meant I was in a new insurance plan year when I actually had the surgery, so my insurance deductible was back at $2500.  I also had co-insurance of 10% for the surgery (which included OR rental, anesthesiologist, drugs, etc.) even though my surgeon was in my insurance network.  In the end, I was on the hook for about $8000 for the (non-emergency) surgery alone.  I spent just one night in the hospital.  It took me about two years to pay off my medical bills.\n\nI was VERY lucky -- I had health insurance, I could delay my surgery, I had enough sick leave to cover my absence at work, and I have no dependents (spouse/children/aged parents).  \n\nMaybe Ian has excellent health insurance coverage, but I can almost guarantee it won't cover 100% of his medical bills (I don't think plans like this exist in the US -- at least, none that I've ever heard of), and health insurance definitely won't cover the time he misses from work.  Even assuming the best insurance and sick-time wise, I'm happy to give this guy some cash.  His was exemplary behavior in a horrible circumstance, and I want to reward it."

Pre-authorized hospital stays are covered at 60%, and unauthorized hospital stays are covered at 50%.\n\nIf I need an x-ray or blood work, I pay 20% of the bill if it\'s a "free-standing" lab, but I pay 40% of the bill if it\'s a hospital-based lab as long as the labs are in network.

We have Jains, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, athiests, tribals and their beliefs etc.  All of them have a long history of being in this country, and for a lot of those groups also, india is their traditional home, just as much as it is for hindus. \n\n>India is the last remaining home where Hindus are in majority.\n\nWrong. Nepal is also there. \n\n>Unlike Christianity and Islam\n\nYou have forgotton about buddhism it seems, which also is from india and has taken over other lands. \n\n>If India falls, its end of the road for Hinduism. \n\nThat does not mean that if india is not a 'hindu nation' then it is the end of the road for hinduism. Hinduism has thrived under far far more difficult circumstances in the nation's history, and in fact, right now is a very good time to be one in india. \n\n>So why does the idea of having laws that promote and preserve Hinduism sparks such outrage?\n\nMultiple factors. Despite what many people, especially in the RSS feel like, hinduism is actually pretty complicated and beliefs, even core beliefs, change from region to region. So things like banning beef might be welcome in some places, while not be welcome in others. Hinduism in not a monolith, and often laws which 'speak for hindus' only speak for a subsection of them. Also, once again, india is home to many other people from other religions as well as people who dont' believe in any religion, and making laws which favour one religion is not fair for others. "

When everyone in the West thinks about "India", it\'s always Bhangra, butter chicken, Taj Mahal etc. \n\n>can\'t say the same about eastern India.\n\nWe get lumped in with the rest of the North and aren\'t that important anymore so people don\'t seem to realize our cultures are distinct. Everyone recognizes that NE is pretty foreign and the South (at least TN) defends their heritage pretty fiercely. '
'First of all, it\'s far easier for a North Indian to learn Hindi than it is for a South Indian. Hindi is closely related to languages like Punjabi, Haryanvi, etc., but unrelated to South Indian languages like Tamil and Kannada, and Hindi is also unrelated to NE languages like Mizo and Meitei. Many North Indian languages use the Devanagri script or closely related writing systems, while South and NE languages generally don\'t. This puts people in the South and NE at a distinct disadvantage, and even if we implement Hindi education, it will still have the statistical effect of reducing our participation in Government and national affairs compared with North Indians. Hindi as the "official language" is fine, as long as the scheduled languages maintain their functionally official status and as long as we can conduct our affairs in our own languages. There is simply no need for Hindi in a non-Hindi state unless we create the need artificially (haven\'t things worked fine for 70 years?), and non-Hindi speakers already learn Hindi when working in the North or working for the Government.\n\nSecondly, Indian languages *are* dying at a rapid pace. It is estimated that over 200 languages have gone extinct in the last 50 years, mostly in the North, Central and NE regions. This is definitely not all because of Hindi, but it has played a role. The major issue is that in the North, the label "Hindi" has been applied to a huge array of languages, including distinct languages like Rajasthani. This means that standard Hindi has become what is called a "prestige dialect". The common pattern whenever a prestige dialect is established is for people to start moving towards that dialect and teaching their kids that version. So this means that many local languages in the North are moving towards being replaced by standard Hindi. Even some major languages are suffering - for instance, the Bhojpuri and Awadhi languages in UP are slowly being replaced in common use with standard Hindi (but people don\'t realise it, as they are classified as "Hindi" anyway). This is exactly the same as the Chinese Government classifying an entire family of languages as "Chinese", and then promoting Mandarin as the standard form for more than half a century - the result is that even major regional Chinese languages like Cantonese and Wu are in danger today.\n\nSouth Indian languages like Tamil, Telugu, etc. will be more resistant to this for a while because of their large number of speakers and robust literary and cultural base, but a national language will always prevail in the long term. This will happen a lot faster in the North-East, which is close to the North and where most languages are quite small. People aren\'t scared that their languages will go extinct tomorrow or in the next generation. They are afraid that it will happen slowly, so that the languages are gone 5 or 10 generations down the line. There are so many examples of this around the world that it isn\'t at all unlikely.\n\n'

Actor Prakash Raj questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the murder of Gauri Lankesh.\n\nA case has been registered against National award-winning actor Prakash Raj in a Lucknow court on a complaint lodged by a lawyer over his recent remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news agency ANI reported. The case is scheduled to be heard on October 7.\n\nOn Monday, Raj stirred up a storm after questioning the “absolute silence” of PM Modi on those “celebrating” the killing of journalist Gauri Lankesh. The actor, a close friend of the Lankesh family, said the prime minister and others were acting as if nothing had happened despite having social media followers celebrating the killing on social media.\n\n“Who killed my dear friend Gauri is not as important to me today as who has been celebrating her death. There may not be proof as to who killed Gauri but we can see who is celebrating it and from this we can form an idea of who could have killed her. The underlying cruelty in all of this is apparent to many people. Many of those celebrating Gauri’s death are persons followed by the Prime Minister on social media. The PM has been absolutely silent about these people,” Raj said while speaking at the 11th annual convention of left-affiliated students’ group Democratic Youth Federation of India.\n\nALSO READ: BJP hits out at actor Prakash Raj for criticising PM Modi\n\nHe went on to say that: “When we see these people going around acting as if nothing has happened, I feel like giving them the five National Awards I have won for acting.” “Look I am a seasoned actor, can I not see through the acting? Give me some respect. Am I stupid? Are people foolish that they cannot see through all this? Are the youth of today blind? The time has come for Modi to understand this,” Raj continued.\n\nSoon after his speech, reports emerged that Raj wants to give back his national award in protest against the killing of veteran journalist Gauri Lankesh. Rubbishing such reports, the actor clarified saying, “Well I can just laugh at the crawling on the newschannel that Prakash Raj has decided to give back his national awards. I am not such a fool to give back my national awards. It has been given to me for my body of work, which I am very proud of.”\n\nA popular actor in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil film industries, Raj has secured five National Film Awards for his movies.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'I remember back in 2011 or 2010, there was a small news article tucked in middle pages about how PM celebrated his birthday.

"Happy Birthday Dr Manmohan Singh.\n\nFirst UPA term was awesome even the second term was better than what we have now even though second term was shit compared to the first one. \n\nCommunists were with UPA for first term and we had people friendly programs like MNERGA, right to food etc but with the brakes gone in second term it was full on march of neo-liberalism trampling over people and now it has only gone worse.\n\nAs Arun Shourie said, this government is UPA 2 + Cow. Religion is indeed the opium of masses as Marx said, it couldn't be more truer than in today's India."

Or worse, to be complicit in the scams? \n\nThe man changed the future of India for the better in 1991, and he must always be celebrated for it. However, he was a failure of a PM.\n\nCompetent?

'Metro is probably the greatest thing the government has achieved in the last decade in Delhi.  '
"Delhi metro has single handedly change the whole NCR region. Mass transit was sorely missing and kudos to E.Sreedharan for thumbing a nose at all the powerful stakeholders who wanted changes in alignment or didn't want a metro in their backyard. \n\nHe focused on the plan and achieved it in record time and without changes. Very critical for mass transport projects."
"Its a pity their success hasn't been reliably replicated anywhere else in India.  \nBangalore has been terribly slow. At one point, it seemed that their toy train between mg road and indiranagar was all we will get for a decade or so. \n\nMumbai also had its fair share of issues, and they just started the major lines construction now, though andheri ghatkopar line is at least very useful in removing east west congestion in roads and trains. "
'As soon as I read United Nations, for a moment I thought this was just a WhatsApp forward.  '
"Shouldn't the Indian railways have gotten this ages ago for their suburban train systems? Those lines are the only reason cities like Chennai and Mumbai were able to grow without being engulfed in their own pollution like Delhi. "
"This sub is making so many United nations and UNESCO related jokes that I almost didn't take this seriously as well :/"
'Which award will Mumbai local get? It has also helped in curbing pollutions '
"Lets not forget, this happened under Congress government. Delhi that i grew up in was very different from today's delhi when it comes to transport including roads/power situation. Even health services have improved.   "
'Do you mean that Bangalore has finally managed to move past that metro train which was more like a joy ride?'
'if you had to compare it to the monorail, which would you chose? I have heard good things about both!'
'I feel only Mumbaikars can appreciate how much the local means to them.'

"If IAS fellows are handling it now, rest assured the project speed will go back to the glorious days of the 60's and the 70's."
"Not really. See my comment elsewhere in this thread.\n\nAlso, while Delhi got priority ('after all it is the national capital'), Centre refused to give guarantee for loans from JICA/JBIC for Mumbai. It is these foreigners who took pity and relaxed loan conditions. Finally, the phase one of the project eventually had to be handed over to a private company and the city burnt its fingers over things like branding services and stations, and fares!"
"Don't think any political party can lay outright claim to the success of Delhi Metro.. Most of the credit should go to E Sreedharan. Most people tend to criticize babus so we should give them credit where it's due."
"If it's an IAS, then he is posted in the department only for one reason. To siphon off as much money as possible and send it up. The honest unicorns of IAS don't get posted in lucrative departments like construction. The best way to delay anything is to hand it over to an IAS "
"You also need a government to make sure they don't interfere with the working. The government in power makes the appointments. So without the government cooperating, not even Sreedharan can do his job. "
"Agreed. Which is why I said outright claim. They do deserve credit for appointing the right man.\n\nBut an argument can be made that at that point both parties would've picked Sreedharan for the project after his brilliant work with the Konkan railways."

When I had gone to America and met an American TV producer, I was told that she was actually amazed at the kind of writing that we do here. \n\nWe should applaud the writers who actually write one show for eight years – reinvent the characters day in and day out without taking a break, no season break and continue having similar ratings. These are the people we should somewhere applaud because in America, if I had the liberty to write only about twenty episodes of one hour and take six months to write it, then I think I would do a great job.

If the foreigner had told Miss Kapoor that her writing sucks, she would have shot back saying who are you to tell me what works and doesn't work in India. You are an outsider.

"I have thought about many ways on how to end divisions among human beings. Turns out we can't. \n\nThe only way we can fix it is to make these divisions more humane. So maybe, as we bring more and more people out of poverty, hopefully caste will soon cease to exist, or become less prominent. Sure, some divisions will be there too, like people not marrying people of other castes will likely be present for a long amount of time. \n\nEducation may help a bit, but consider there are other factors too that shape a person's identity, not just education. 60 years after independence we still haven't been able to solve our sex ratio and gender issues, even after a miraculous advancement in education. \n\nMaybe we just need to accept that future India will be wealthy, prosperous and powerful, but will still have weird problems of it's own. \n\nOr maybe we are not that hopeless. Maybe caste and religion problems will go away as soon as our previous generation dies. "

It’s what students wear on their wrists, on their foreheads, around their necks, under their shirts. It’s who they are.\n\n> A Dalit student of a school in Tirunelveli town said the pottu (bindi or tilak) worn by students were also colour-coded. “If you wear a pottu with yellow sandalwood paste, with a dash of vermilion on it, I know you are a Thevar,” he said. The other dominant castes, like the Nadars, have their own colour-coded tilaks; Dalits, he said, usually don’t wear them.\n\n> Students also wear lockets with photographs of leaders representing their castes. K Kamaraj lockets are popular among Nadar students; the Thevars wear lockets with photographs of U Muthuramalingam Thevar, a veteran political leader for Thevars'

"> It's funny because a large reason why Islam grew (at least, in East Bengal) is because many low caste Bongos didn't want to put up with the abuses of the higher caste ones. So they opted out. \n\nDo you have a source for that?\n\nThere's actually a lot of interesting recent literature about the history of religion in East Bengal. Contrary to common assumptions, I think one of the leading theories is that many in East Bengal were not really Hindus who converted to Islam. There were a lot of local, tribal religious practices prevalent in East Bengal. Both Islam and Hinduism appear to arise in East Bengal around the same time (during the Mughal and British eras) and they all appear to be rather mixed up and syncretic for a while -- i.e., outside observers not really knowing what they're practicing. It took a long time (up to recent history) for East Bengal to be brought into the mainstream of the subcontinent. \n\nI don't deny of course that casteism will cause many lower caste people to leave Hinduism. Just that the religious history of East Bengal seems to be a bit of an open matter with lots of interesting things going on. "

And even by an even larger miracle, if we get footpath where surface is miraculously not uneven, then they are destroyed immediately like this.\n\nThis is what I don't understand about these mega leaders. Is their ego that fragile that viewing their face on a poster for fleeting few seconds while traveling that important? Come election time or some political rally, streets, utility poles, bridge columns, compound walls etc are all uglified by posters & party flags.\n\nThere are laws against disfigurement. Laws against unauthorised posters being plastered. Laws against destruction of public property. But no one dare act against these Netas.\n\nModiji made a huge hue & cry when he said he wanted a 'book' instead of huge ass garland.

"Yes, I am. Tamil nationalism is a huge thing in TN, and every election is won by one of two Dravidian/Tamil nationalist parties. Pretty much every party here is opposed to Hindi as the national language (which is the general sentiment in TN anyway), Tamil protection and promotion is a pretty much ubiquitous policy platform, and I've never personally heard any important political speech given in any language apart from Tamil.\n\nWhen someone does give a speech in English however, [it becomes a matter of controversy](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/War-of-words-over-DMK-member’s-English-speech/article14511777.ece). As you will see in that link, the incident in question caused a bit of a row in the State Assembly. Fellow legislators questioned how he was elected, and others demanded that his speech be expunged from the records entirely, just because it wasn't made in Tamil.\n\nGiving a speech in Hindi would be political suicide."

'Underclasses aren\'t some arbitrary religious notion, sure religions ride on it, but it\'s more a social matter. While people tie India\'s caste system to Hinduism, I\'m not sure European feudal structures could have been tied to Christianity. There isn\'t really a \'NEED\' for an underclass, certainly not one as large as India\'s. The underclass is what bogs us down. (On that note, undermining Hinduism is in essence undermining social order, perhaps the root cause of disarray.) The underclasses care little about society, about the commons, about norms that enable civilization. These matters are generally beyond them.\n\nWhen you say "history always follows a path to justice", I\'m unsure what bases you\'re using for the claim. It is no secret that dominant moral notions prevail at any time, and it appears you\'re using the same.\n\nI care not, merely, about the despicable members of the underclasses I went to school with. They alone matter little to the civilization\'s current state or to its future. What I do care about is the continued plundering of our civilization by the likes of this doctor-lady-turned-politician and other members of the underclasses, besides the "elites" who enable the plunder through their asinine moral pursuits. There\'s a lot of work ahead, several generations\' worth, to rein in the underclasses and rebuild our culture merely even to avoid extermination of our civilization, lest we become like Africa (or worse by the looks of it).\n'

"British left the system 70 years ago. India had (still have) the opportunity for the whole 70 years and couldn't do a shit. What do you attribute these last 70 years to? British? I call this BS. \n\nYes, British were evil. But the Politicians that came after? They looted in hordes and still are."
"you don't have to listen, you're an adult act like it."
"ya but that's due to how they were raised, i.e. British system. Like Gandhi, Nehru, Jinnah. All these dudes are Indian but really British through education. And by perpetuating this, you get a conservative nation like UK. You really have to have a nation that would reject the conservatism through young people, but not to like go into American capitalism/materialism because that's also trash. "
'When the government says you can\'t sell ~~acow~~ cattle at  a marketplace for slaughter (even when if is legal to slaughter that cattle -many states allow bulls, buffaloes (male and female), and some states aloow old cows beyond milking age to be slaughtered), you can "act like an adult" only if you\'re prepard to go to jail. \n\nEdit: correction from cow to cattle, and clarification on legality, so apologists can\'t continue defending mudisarkar.'
"But my point was that you still had 70 years. Forget about what's past. How are we going forward? Are we making any positive changes (yea, all those RSS inspired History book changes. Right), ways to address employment, child labor, poverty, skill development, and infrastructure on a ground level, not the bullet trains?\n\nI care less about the past, but how to achieve what lies ahead. Let's see what Politicians do we have that are visionary and take chances for the next 100 years' development. Mere Jumlas won't go and matter."
"Id want India to be run with a free market eque type with protectionism for the indian economy so America or European don't buy up all the land and make a walmart while the gov.

'In many states it is not illegal to sell bulls or buffaloes (male or female) for slaughter. Some states even allow old cows beyond milking age to be slaughtered.\n\nThe market sale ban was for all cattle, not just illegal cow sales. But I clearly used the wrong word. Will edit it above.'
'Thats when the government ecourages and rewards gaurakshasas, and looks the other way when they lynch.'
'>Id want India to be run with a free market eque type with protectionism\n\nAre you sure you know what Free market means?'

"Aside: \nBad visualization. Circle in circle area charts misrepresent numbers. Ink isn't linearly proportional to the values. If they wanted to stick with this schema, they should of have instead gone for pie charts."
'A clear trend is visible from this map. Very high degree of vegetarianism in the west/north belt and low degree in East/South.\n\nBasically, the degree of vegetarianism is higher to states with some degree of proximity to the north western side from which Muslim invaders started coming to India. \n\nThis goes very well with the theory that vegetarianism is a defense mechanism. Hindu diet (even for "upper-castes") was not vegetarian in practice prior to the 10th century. External aggression forces a segment of people inwards and leads to greater focus and following of points of difference between aggressors and locals. Since, diet was a point of difference with north-westerners diet being primarily non-vegetarian (due to nomadic nature and lack of agricultural land), vegetarian diet became a defense mechanism towards saving one\'s culture from the invasion. Hence, places that were not attacked as frequently in in 10th-14th centuries remained largely non-vegetarian.'
"Prod Meat-eating Telanganite checking in. We eat a lot of 'offal' [offal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offal)   - liver, udders, kidneys, brains, tongue, etc. Those are delicacies.

"Absolutely. Most Sikhs renounce meat and alcohol after a certain age. \n\nIt's called 'amrit chakhna' "
'This is a good question. Indian non-vegetarianism is dominated by white meat such as poultry and fish which is far less intense by western standards of non-vegetarianism where red meat dominate the plate. Red meat in India is consumed in lighter forms of goat and sheep meat largely. \n'
"Differs from country to country. Some treat egg as vegetarian diet while others don't"
"In my book, vegetarian means you do not eat meat of any kind. Eggs are a grey are - i don't think it is an automatic disqualifier from being vegetarian.\n\nThe kind of meat you eat does not make a difference. You could be a pescetarian like Bengali brahmins (who only eat fish) but that does not make you a vegetarian."

"Dalit Sikhs are 33% of Punjab's population and thus the largest single group in Punjab (Jat Sikhs come second at 25%). \nThey have their own Army Regiment [Sikh Light Infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_Light_Infantry) and were classified as a 'Martial Race' by the British, the only Dalit caste other than the Maharashtrian Mahars to be so. \n\nTheir culture is just like that of Jats with a strong attachment to agriculture and working on the land. Most of them are from farming backgrounds like Jats. The only difference is their smaller landholdings and lesser literacy levels. However it is unfair to compare Punjabni Dalits' condition to that of elsewhere in the country. They along with the Maharashtrian Dalits tend to be relatively better off and **I would wager that a Dalit Soldier family in Punjab is probably richer and healthier than a Brahmin rickshaw-driver from Eastern UP or Bihar**."

"Wanted to say this for the last few days. Couldn't bring myself to do it amid all the deaths.

You seem to have the clarity of an insider's view. \n\nAll our school life, school textbooks stated how the gender ratio in Punjab and Haryana is more skewed than anywhere else in the country. Does this apply within the Dera culture too? Do they actually end up being beneficial for women's rights, especially in such largely downtrodden sections of society? \n\nAlso... how do they manage to create such a mass illusion of togetherness or unity?

'Yes, Jharkhand has a strong adivasi movement rooted in the demand for a separate state. Chattisgarh has none of that. The NGOs have filled that void. Bela Bhatia, Nandini Sundar, JAGLAG and all. \n\nNow these NGOs have good contact with the national media and by extension a lot of things happening in Chattisgarh are reported in the national media. So, despite Jharkhand having more area under the red corridor, Chattisgarh gets most of the coverage on Naxal issues. \n\nThat said, the abuses by security forces are rare in Jharkhand because of the presence of strong adivasi groups(Thanks to Shibu Soren and Jaipal Singh Munda). The resistance is less in Chattisgarh and the excesses by security forces are ubiquitous. Then there is the warlord SRP Kalluri. \n\nBut when it comes to information on rapes and abuses by security forces, its a virtual information black hole in the North East and Kashmir.

"Well, because this is a civil issue and involving military in a civilian issue requires some unprecedented situation. You might have opinion that this is indeed such a situation where military should be involved. But the government can not involve a security force whose job is to protect our borders in an issue for which it is not meant to be.\n\nInvolving military in situation which still hasn't become uncontrollable is quite premature IMO. This shows lack of power of law enforcement on the part of State. Involving military in civil issues only emboldens them and gives them authorities that they should not have. The control of military companies is with a military leader and not a State representative. Military is very good and efficient at cutting down enemy military forces and not so much at controlling crowds of our our own citizens. In case something bad happens they will use excessive force which may result in a large number of casualties.\n\nHaving said all that, I do agree that adequate amount of military personnel should kept ready on stand by in case situation becomes uncontrollable by the state police and CRPF."

We all know who they are, what their ideology is. Some of those celebrating this ghastly episode are being followed by none other than Mr Modi himself. This is what worries me, where is our country is headed to?”\n\n> He went on to say that he was “worried about the PM’s silence”. Lankesh was murdered near her Bengaluru home on September 5. Raj was a close friend of the journalist and an ardent admirer of her father, P Lankesh.\n\n\n> “I knew Gauri for 30 years. In a sense, we were all children of (P) Lankesh, his ideologies and way of life. I never dreamt that this day would come. We were taught to be honest citizens, who would never seize to raise one’s voice. In fact, I don’t think anyone voiced their opinion more than P Lankesh himself. This was how we were taught to be. It is astonishing to see where we have come to today,”\n\n\n**Edit**: I am adding the bit about returning the award. He was mocking our politicians, and not actually talking of giving back his awards:\n\n> “When you look at the kind of statements he (Adityanath) makes, you don’t understand whether he’s a Chief Minister or a priest. He (Adityanath) is a better actor than me.

'This wiki article has a good bit of details about how all the princely states became part of India: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_integration_of_India\n\nAlso Pakistan (and Bangladesh) did not split because British forces left. The British left after the partition, and both the countries gained their independence. Bangladesh was "East Pakistan" until they fought a (successful) war of Independence in 1971 with help from India.'
'Well, there were princely states which were sort of independent. Those were United with India, most were willing, some were not. You should look into nizam of hyderabad, nawab of junagadh, kashmir, of course. And then there are union territories under French and Dutch rule that took a while. These are what I remember from textbooks. '
"Some of the Muslims thought that they would never be accepted by the Majority Hindu population and if you look in history you will find they had a pretty good reasons for that.

But that\'s another matter entirely.'
">I mean in the end you have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nThat sounds good in a novel, not in real life where people are involved.\n\nIt's not about what we gave up, or who is more rich currently, it's about doing your job properly and finishing things. Partition was not."
'Those straight lines were drawn in sandy deserts or dense jungles, not in densely populated plains like Punjab  and Bengal. Radcliff had district and Tehsil borders to help him. '
"Look up how borders are decided. There's a good video by, I think, CGP Grey or Wendover. And, a good, epic explanatory comment on Reddit somewhere. There are reasons why some places get a lot of straight, rigid borders and others look more organic. For one, less rigid borders are generally a good sign, unless they're merely following a feature like a river."
"The point I wanted to make was, to preserve the abbreviation, like for BMC, when Bombay was changed to Mumbai, instead of renaming it MMC, they put 'Brihanmumbai' to preserve the abbreviation for sake of clarity. "
'**Political integration of India**\n\nAt the time of Indian independence in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining in the hands of their hereditary rulers, and control over external affairs and defence being vested in the Government of India under the Viceroy. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24'
"I don't think the British wanted partition. The conspiracy theories of a United India being 'too powerful' are pretty silly - India is only now approaching the UK's total GDP and back then it was much smaller.\nHowever, a lot of the blame for Partition has to go on the British, as it was their policies of 'divide and rule' and the system of different seats for different religions which led to the creation of the partition movement "

Trump was featured on the June 2007 issue of the Sharper Image magazine to promote his then-new brand of steaks, which were billed as the "world\'s greatest". Prices of the four packages of Trump Steaks varied from $199 to $999. The steaks were USDA Angus certified, and were supplied by Buckhead Beef. Trump Steaks were only sold at The Sharper Image for two months before being discontinued.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.23'

It's these places where basic necessities is a fight."
"For those who don't know, Delhi used to have drinking water in taps until early 1990s. RO Systems were something that only the rich could afford and it wasn't really a necessity.\n\nI have drunk water from school taps and from roadside piaos and never had a problem.\n\nBefore we had a fridge, we stored water in matkas for all drinking and cooking needs and never had a problem.\n\nSo this news is news for the new generation."

"Lived in Lucknow during 2000-2002. Got drinking water even in the worst days of summer. Water didn't smell bad and I never got diarrhea because of water.

In those countries, there are question marks around heavy metals like lead being used in the plumbing."
'I used to direct from tap when studying in college. The water supplied by the government in most of Delhi is actually treated water.

You aint fooling me again. Cyber cell also gave clean chit to hrithik.\n\nAlso she remembers all this just before her movie release, common sense says she is a big time liar and playing victim card. But hey she is a women so she must be harrased and male is the opperessor. Fuck off with feminazi bullshit, you are ruining lives of ppl. \n\nBut she didnt do fairness cream ad and went up against bollywood so she is a goddess and cant do anything wrong.

"This is my throwaway account so I can share my experience with you guys.. I have worked with both of them and this is what I have observed about them and what I think.\n\n**Both are psychotic crazy:**\n\nHrithik hides behind his metaphorical reaches and how mind is the ultimate bliss and stuff like that but he has so much attitude that I cannot comprehend, especially for an actor who has not given a hit in a while and has been known to blow collection figures up industry wide.\n\nKangana is female psychotic and if her stories of how she treats people on sets came out this entire narrative would change in a minute.\n\n**The hype around them:**\nHrithik is pretty well settled and can get press easily, he has major contacts and star power to pull.\n\nKangana on the other hand got lucky with couple of movies that became such a big hit that everyone basically forgot what an horrible actor she actually is. \n\n**Evidence:**\nEvery actor has a crew, no matter what they do where they go somebody in there team is always aware of where they are if not with who they are. Where is that person from both the sides? Surely, if one of them is damn right about there stance, there must be one person atleast? Where is that person?\n\n> Also you are telling me, two major stars got married, had an affair and there wasn't even a whiff of gossip? Affairs become popular faster than movies, no matter how much anyone hides it. *Cough* Aamir*Cough*. Not even a blind item hinting at this relationship? \n\nFor years it apparently went on nobody had any idea, nobody ever clicked a pic, all they have is bunch of emails? Really?\n\n**Verdict:**\nFrom what I know and can tell, Kangana really stirred stuff up for promotions of her recent movie because she knows even with her success she is still not enough to pull audience. So she needed a controversy and things to say.\n\n> Seeing how the culture is today of blame the guy she went on about her struggles without producing even one speck of proof. \n\nThe moment her first interview went viral she became media magnet and went anywhere and everywhere to complain, but nowhere produced a single proof. \n\n**Then movie released and she disappeared again, why no more interviews? Why is she still not fighting if she is right?**\n\nBlame on Hrithik:\nThe main blame on Hrithik is that if he was innocent why was he quiet for so long?\n\nA. As a guy when the entire world is blaming you for something you didn't do at a time where feminism is such a hot topic, what will you do? Anytime you open your mouth ten more people come around to push more blame on you without ever asking for proof. \n\nIn this situation the best thing to do is stay quiet and let authorities work which he did. \n\n> I have seen this happen to a friend, if it was not for good cops he was screwed. \n\nThat's the reality of it. Think for a second before blaming anyone and if she produces proof tomorrow I will definitely change my mind but until then I was with Hrithik and still am for now."
'I have followed this issue for a while. I don\'t care about either of the celebrities (although I have been on Hrithik\'s side since the beginning), to me this issue is more about blind feminism vs. truth.\n\nHe puts things more eloquently than I could ever hope to. Just because women have been oppressed since time immemorial and continue to be be oppressed even today DOES NOT mean that men cannot be victims of malicious, deranged women. I see false accusations of rape/molestation/harassment [around me all the time](http://m.hindustantimes.com/india/male-pilots-put-flyers-at-risk-to-avoid-sexual-harassment-charges/story-m2ZhDsvSt4jyJs8fU3THlI.html). I have been a victim of false accusations of verbal abuse by an angry ex (admittedly at a very small scale), which allowed me to witness "hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" first hand. It\'s a situation where you end up feeling completely helpless. I believe it is often a power play by women who are angry at the world and usually choose an innocent, unsuspecting victim to slaughter in order to satisfy their ego (bali ka bakra). Most women in high positions are so graceful but I have seen my share of complete, absolute bitches who take certain pleasure in putting down a man and it affects those people more who have always been sincerely respectful of women and never treated them any better or worse than a man.\n\nIt\'s possible that Hrithik is lying and Kangana is telling the truth, but then we need give him the benefit of the doubt until he is proven guilty, and stop supporting the other party only because she is a woman.'
"I am not at all annoyed at Hrithik or Kangana. They are doing what they are supposed to. Do shit to get noticed.\n\nWhat I don't get is why are all the top media houses giving these guys attention? I don't want to see what Hrithik is saying to Kangana in the front page.\n\nI knew the level of journalism in this country isn't that high to begin with but this isn't top news people, this simply isn't!"
"Quick question on his interview with Arnab . He said he couldn't block her emails because of mac book pro. I don't have a mac book but can't you block all emails from the server?

'yeah u r saying right\n'
"> However, in every disadvantaged group, there are advantaged people. She's one of them.\n\nVery well said - I hadn't thought of it those words but that's a great way of putting it. "
"Unrelated to the current affair, but actresses *are* on an uneven playing field compared to actors of the same caliber. Sexism in the industry is real, and it isn't this melodrama like choosing whose side to take in a spat. It exists when the shelf-life of actors is 20 years while actresses are popular only for 5-10 years. It exists when actresses aren't given leading roles, and whose dialogues only revolve around the men in the movie. It will keep existing until actresses are treated equally as heroes, not just as wives or mothers or item girls.\n\nI'm not saying Kangana is disadvantaged in this public spat, but at the same time you shouldn't end up believing that actresses and actors generally have an even playing field, and sexism doesn't exist."

"Explain to me how the Maratha and Mughal empires would have handled their merger? And in what universe would the South Indian kingdoms have agreed to join them? Even during the Independence War of 1857, North Indian rebels couldn't agree whether the independent nation should be ruled by Bahadur Shah Zafar, the Maratha rulers, the Nawab of Awadh, and others locally. This was not even counting the sentiments of South Indians who ignored the whole thing, or the various North Indian factions who sided against them.\n\nIndia prior to the British was divided into hundreds of kingdoms, tribes, chiefdoms and city-states. Even if you group them by alliances, common allegiances and all of that, you still end up with *dozens*. Prior to the British, a Kashmiri, Tamil and Mizo would not have considered each other to be even remotely related, let alone countrymen. It was the common experience of our independence struggle and the linking of the nation through the railways, telegraph, postal system and common bureaucracy that united the people.\n\nSo while I disagree with pretty much every other argument in favour of British colonialism, I do agree that we would not have ended up with the united nation that we have today, unless one kingdom military conquered all the rest - something that the Mauryans, Mughals and Delhi Sultanate came close to, but which they could never maintain and which they never managed to achieve in full.\n\n**EDIT:** Spanish Latin America is divided for geographical and historical reasons - covering a vast and unmanageable area with large tracts of impassable land (the Andes, Amazon rainforest, the Darién Gap, etc.), and gaining independence through multiple localised independence movements over a longer span of time."

"The way a closed economy works is this - and bear in mind I'm massively oversimplifying it - even if there is economic oppression of a group, like for example with income inequality now in India or the US, there is still growth a development from consumption linkages. If a nawab or a Rajkumar of India oppresses his people, whatever he does spend is recirculated within  the economic system - his money goes to the local courtiers and the Royal food suppliers and Royal tailors and so on. These people spend locally as well. And while it sucks to be the oppressed class or caste, no question about it, the wealth is circulating within the system and can potentially lead to growth and development and a higher standard of living. \n\nWhen the wealth is sucked out by colonial enterprises, all that money that would have been spent on consumption locally is extracted, piped out to the UK in this case, and contributes to growth and development and a higher standard of living THERE. \n\nSo yeah. While it would have been shitty to be lower caste, overall the system would be better and yes, his numbers do stack up. And let's not forget - it STILL sucks to be lower caste in India. So what you think is a factor that would affect the numbers is actually quite irrelevant to the question."
'Well, two different things. The oppression from colonization was worse because it was deliberately done for the sake of resources on an established society and culture. What you point out to are the settlers at the dawn of civilizations and the resulting oppression (surely centuries after!) that emerged from their need to organize society which in itself had no precedent. Hunter-gatherers were nomadic till the time of settling and it was only when the number of settlers grew large enough that management became necessary and societies were founded. Even tasks in modern societies are divided based on temperament and skill sets (mental, vital, physical including skilled work and pure labor) but the classification is based on education and open validation of talent; not caste. A skilled laborer (say a cobbler) would be discriminated against and scoffed at even today, were he to declare he wanted a seat in the parliament. The only difference in the democratic set up is that we provide concession for such possibility to emerge if a cobbler can indeed prove himself to be that worthy.'

'As another practicing advocate, I would like to let you guys know that this is not the case with all judges. There are judges who like to write elaborate judgements maybe because they think there is a need to elucidate their point or because they want to show off. There are comparably equal judges in the higher courts who write crisp and to the point judgements. \n\nTldr: Judgements are written in all shapes and sizes. '
"I believe you're incorrect to say it started after 1970. The problem of nearly 40,000 judgments since 1950, many of which run into hundreds of pages was acknowledged by the SC. [Source](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Supreme-Court-judges-bat-for-succinct-judgments/articleshow/45017501.cms?nltype=&newsletter=)\n\nI think so after 1970's it has reduced to 10 pages long as you say. (Not sure, can you provide a citation)\n\nSC judges have informally come together to accept a hitherto unadmitted yet serious problem — verbose verdicts often create confusion, both for law and litigants. This is just one of the reasons for delay in rendering speedy justice to litigants.\n\nIn 2014, CJI Justice HL Dattu, had set up two committees to tackle arrears in both — the SC and HCs. I could not find their reports though. However, the trend in pending cases in decreasing, whilein HC and lower courts it is increasing.\n\nMany SC CJI's have been advocating need to render speedy justice and you can see a report on 'Law's Delays: Arrears In Courts', tabled in Rajya Sabha in 2011 [here](http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Home%20Affairs/85threport%20.htm)\n\nI've found that there are various measures which are being followed now. Right from Magistrates, to Judges in Lower Courts  to HC  - all of them have a specific number of cases that they need to dispose in certain period of time. Their performance is analysed based on that and their promotions are based on it.\n\nThe other reasons delaying speedy justice is \n\n- The advocates who wantonly drag the cases to favor their litigants and thereby add to the chaos. \n\n- Many advocates also file private petitions full well knowing that there is no substance to the case and this adds a huge number to the cases.\n\n- Inordinate delay in filling up vacancy of judges - in HC and lower courts, this is the main reason for the rise in pending cases.\n\n- Lack of computerization of the lower courts (where there are the most number of cases!)- this archaic system of writing on papers/typing it out, storing it, retrieving it etc add to delay and also gives rise to corruption and other illegal activities!\n\n- setting up additional fast track courts. I also feel instead of just dividing the lower courts to Civil & Criminal, if more additional courts are setup to just focus on specific cases say for example, a special court to just look on matrimonial cases, inordinate delay andpressure on the magistrates will be reduced significantly.\n\nThis is not exhaustive list though. I hope such reforms will ensure speedy and impartial justice to litigants."
"SCCOnline has tl;dr version inform of case notes. But it can be costly. \n\nYes, I absolutely agree with the point about the lengthy judgements. \nI am a law student. Last semester we had two read two judgements Menaka Gandhi and Bachan Singh in our English class. Our teacher told us to treat them not as a judgement but as a piece of literature and analyze. She made us skip most of it, though. Bachan Singh was bearable but Menaka Gandhi was not. It was page after page of useless quotations. It had quotations from Vivekananda, Plato, Chanakya and bazzillion others, just to prove the point that travelling is a part of right to life (art 21) and then there was so much repetitive arguments on why it is not in art 19(1)(g). And man was it anti climactic, they didn't even give her passport back.\n\nJustice Krishna Iyer had way with the words. He wrote beautifully but dude chill, you don't need to prove it to us that you are smart. You are a SC judge, we know you know more than us. I'd quote him from another important judgement of his, Shamsher Singh v State of Punjab \n         Not the Potomac but the Thames fertilises the flow of Yamuna.\n Not ashamed to say that had to Google it to find its meaning and you bet I wrote it in my consti exam. :-) \n\n\nI remember one time we were reading a judgement for a moot. It was a Delhi HC judgement. It was a COPRA case on  doctor's negligence and this judge had gone on for pages just stating that doctors are supposed to be miracle workers, they are supposed to do good and if they are negligent, how much loss is caused to a person. And then it was repeated in the part where compensation has to be determined. I can't find the judgement, will link if I do. \n\nPs. We were taught how to identify the ratio decidendi in class. But it can be so hard. I read just case notes on SCC and then more if it seems relevant. \n\n\n\ntl;dr I concur with the opinion presented by the OP. And I had nothing much or new to add but still wrote this long ass comment."
"Thanks for sharing. As laypersons, this isn't something that we are aware of. Is there a forum/committee/council where this issue can be addressed? "
'The problem is when our Parliament tries to do something about improving court system. The court shut it down. \n\nI totally believe that judicial appointment bill was really good since I think most high Court judges are corrupt and appoint their kids to power .'
"In addition to what you said, I have noticed something else as well: The dissenting opinions have become much shorter nowadays. In most judgments given in 50s or 60s, the dissenting opinion (if there was any) ran into many pages, often being at least 75% size of the other part of the judgment. In fact, I've come across a few judgments where the dissenting opinion was longer than the binding opinion.\n\nIt appears now, though, that judges do not feel the need to 'waste' their time writing long opinions which are not even binding. Perhaps this or some other reasoning, I'm not sure. But I do not agree; dissenting opinions are one of the things that make judgments 'fun' to me - it also ensures that all sides were adequately discussed and argued before the court, and the idea finds a mention there. In fact, recently a nine-judge bench upheld a dissenting opinion given by Justice Sinha several decades ago! I like to believe that dissents hold ideas, very strong ideas, right AND wrong, all essential for a society.\n\nBut of course, that's my observation and belief."
'As much as I love Katju, his judgements are filled with a *lot* of rhetoric and analogy.'

'Thanks to the OP for his detailed account.\n\nThat said, for all these flaws the nature of our administrative and political system is such that there are good reasons why people still trust the judiciary above everything else.'
'Quick delivery of justice is sine qua non for efficient jurisprudence.'
"I suggest writing the judgements like research papers.\n\nFirst, an abstract : Tell me what is it about in the most crisp and formal manner.\n\nThen, put the main meat of the judgement : All the technicalities, circumstances and stuff related to the case with respective diagrams.\n\nAt the end, the conclusion : what judgement did you eventually deliver for the case, and how do you wish it be interpreted if presented in future cases.\n\nNow that I'm writing this comment, I realise that it's a pretty shitty idea and judgements certainly don't work like that, but hey, it's r/india; yaha nahi toh kaha"
'I would be interested to read any good judgment something related crime / homicide where can I read?'
"Another massive problem I face is knowing if a piece of legislation I'm looking at is updated with all the amendments. Save for SEBI and RBI very few government websites bother incorporating the most updated version of their laws, a case in point would be finding the most updated stamp duty act for various states since the entire law varies from state to state. This is a very important piece of legislation since all agreements, deeds, bonds, contracts have to stamped and the duty paid before they are executed and enforceable, and the amount to be paid varies from state to state. 90% of the time, anything you see on the internet regarding stamp duty is going to be outdated."

'Please do an AMA'
'I wish ours became like these! '
'Oh the irony.. \n\nBut here is a TLDR: \n\n> one of the many reasons for delays in the justice system is that supreme court and high court judges (whose judgments are binding on lower courts) write unnecessarily long judgments with more and more irrelevant material, causing overall waste of time, confusion and redundancy amongst lawyers and lower court judges. \n\nAs a lawyer myself, I partly agree. The trend is definitely on the rise, however, there are some cases which demand a deep analysis of the law, and in which cases, lengthy judgments cannot be avoided - often, oversimplification is a danger itself. At the same time, there are copycats who will copy the trend just to showcase their intellectual superiority, and even those who are on the take and will write loop-de-loops to somehow confuse the issue beyond recognition and then pass a judgment favoring the party who they favor, regardless of the merits of the case.

The temple was found desecrated on saturday morning, and the rioting rumors spread within an hour. \n\nWe all were really scared expecting a major flare-up. Luckily the police intervened and caught the guy. \n\nHis story is hogwash ! He was supported by some organization. '
"It's Kerala, but I still love you bruv"
'I don\'t think it\'s unfair to pick partners based on appearance. \n\nI fall on the "wrong" side of that equation(I\'d rate myself 4/10 on appearance, maybe 5 on a good day.), but I think it\'s completely fair game to pick partners based on whatever quality you see fit. May it be brains, money, appearance, height, age, race, sense of humor, proficiency in bed, charisma, or whatever the fuck else... \n\nNo one should be obligated to curtail their personal preferences to follow an arbitrary standard set by someone else.'
'"yeah! We are going to be forward looking for now, except for caste based matrimonial ads.  Can\'t help that. We\'re India sorry."'
"Yes, I'm sure men are never ever rejected for things like height, complexion, 'kitne lakh ka package hai'\n\nToI is being even more ridiculous, you marry a person not their fucking marks/grades. This' solution' has solved nothing. "
'But men will still be  judged by the paisa they make :) '
"I guess the point they're trying to make is: value someone for their work. Looks are something you are born with, so it is not something one can change. But it's really double edged sword. Education and qualifications seem to be something a person has control over... until you realize that even that is largely influenced by what family you are born into."
"I wonder if situation was other way around, then wouldn't girls have asked for tall and handsome. I mean, I get it that we should not ask for fair and beautiful girl in an ad. But the whole point of giving an ad is the fact the we can't find a beautiful person on our *own* in person. \n  \nAlso to clarify, by other way around in the first sentence, I meant, if girls were making way more money and trying to find a guy. When one person is going to be the soul bread owner in a family, then he/she can ask for a much fair soul mate. That's how it goes."
"And i will be single still. I'm like a paradox in space-sax continuum. I'm so single you guys. "
"In other words, choose a girl who can earn more money for you!\n\nWhy should education be a criteria either? It's as pointless as beauty. Why can't we just evaluate\u200b compatibility, intelligence, nurturing traits, humour, thoughtfulness, passion and a high moral fibre in a prospective match"
"Given how higher education, especially elite universities, is strongly correlated - but not exclusive - with upper caste communities, I don't see this as much better.\n\nEducational elitism easily descends into classism, which is linked with caste. Why not focus on people's inner qualities such as how good of a person they are? Why is everything so transactional. You're either your diploma or your skin. Maybe neither. "
"Real change would be when dating becomes socially acceptable across India, so that people can know their partners better before deciding whether they should get married to them at all.  This 'change' seems like some arbitrary prioritization of academics over looks.  That being said, I'll take this over the cringe-worthy 'Fair-skinned blah blah girl seeks blah blah boy' ads."
'Oh god this is so helpful. \n\nThe time I had to spend on sunday matrimony section battling all the redundant stuff is mind numbing.'
'So the least qualified girl gets the least preference? How is that fair then? '
"WoW! Times of India reversing million of years of Genetics and Human Evolution. \n\nHuman mate selection is hard coded into DNA. I'm pretty sure your genes dont care about the Education but the height, hip-to-waist ratio, odour and genetic markers in mate selection and choice. "
"Filter criteria for boys:\n\n1. Religion\n2. Caste\n3. NRI\n4. Height\n5. Salary \n6. Looks\n7. Education\n\nThis is the order of preference for girls on matrimony sites. I have seen 5'9, 5'10 guys getting rejected lol.  God help guys who are shorter than this haha.\n\n\n"
'By doing this TOI has seeded the thought of discrimination clearly. The constitution of India gives us fundamental right of equality and freedom. Everyone should have a right to make choice on the basis of personal preference like appearance, flexibility, compatibility. There are so many things that goes in the process of selecting and rejecting a person with whom you’ll spend all your life. This is not limited to India, the whole world works this way.\n\nHow the actresses are selected in Bollywood - On the basis of looks or acting skills? It looks like just another moral policing stunt by TOI.\n\nKey Takeaway: Beauty is an depreciating asset while knowledge & Money is appreciating.'
'It is good that we are getting some exposure on extreme colorism that is going on in our society. Can we please talk about body shaming as well? Guys not preferring slight overweight girls. Girls completely shunning short guys.'
"These sanctimonious gandus should not meddle in other's affairs.\n\nIsnt the guy expected to be tall and well earning?\nAnd the ones with thinning hair lose out on many potential matches too.\nI hope this backfires on them resoundingly."
"Choosing someone based on the education and profession is not much worse than choosing someone based on their physical appearance. It is also superficial.\n\nA person should be valued for what kind of a person they are. What values\u200b and principles they believe in and how much they act on those. How kind and empathetic they are. And how their morals and values match with yours. Career and appearance don't matter much in the long run. A person's nature can sometimes make you forget any flaws in their looks and career."
'Guys can\'t put their dicks in girls\' Ph.Ds. While a girl being smart is a good thing, who the fuck wants to marry someone like Ayn Rand?\n\nMen want feminine women, and being fair and cute only makes a girl more feminine. All these "stop using fairness creams" chutiyapa is retarded.'
'These are matrimonial ads. In this context, a "fair skin" attribute is as valid as being tall or being fat, where height is also determined at birth. You could do this exact thing with fat women and this sub *should be* outraged.'
"good beginnings, but how come\n\n> love finds **it's** match\n\nwtf - what's with the grammar"
'I wish if the issue of beauty was only limited to picking partners. I live in the US, and in my city, you can clearly see the sharp contrast between how differently people treat equally well dressed and qualified,  white and black females. '
'It is not unfair to pick partners based on appearance.\n\nWhen fair skin, something that tiny minority of the population in India possess, becomes equated with looking good, there is something very wrong with society.'
"Yes as if taking care of looks doesnt take effort . And similarly some part of brain is already gifted, and our educational qualification depends a lot on our parents so that's also not in our hands .      \nFuck this Times shit, trying to be very fair.      "
'Beauty and money a big no for me all other things good. '
'Ha ha ha. Most probably, they would have entire sections dedicated to particular castes - it comes above both beauty and academics for them.'
'Guy has to be good looking and a high earner these days.\n\n'
"It's a good start though. "
"yeah bro body shaming is only cool when it comes to guys. I think it should 'Apologies to a country that's filled with hypocrites'."
"Yeah! Men's matrimonial ads must begin with beauty qualifications! /s"
"Yeah. They could've just said that it's unfair to ask a girl to be fair and beautiful, and that this practice is rampant should no more be continued. Why provide a substitute for it in the form of educational qualifications? There are so many uneducated and not-so educated women who could be great wives.\n"
"> But from today, we suggest changing the format of Matrimonial ads to highlight a girl's educational qualifications\n\nThey meant to highlight educational qualifications for what it is not about high qualifications.\n\nAnyway better to be discriminated for educational qualification (which you can change) rather than beauty\\fairness (which you cannot change) no?"
'The chudaand is that I\'ve seen highly asymetrical and ugly girls in my village who have been labelled beautiful just coz they are white as "sangemarmar"..fucking village chuts. While the darker and beautiful ones are cursed'
'This is the problem with India deep rooted into our minds. Most of our society only cares about the academics. Students with good academic performance are praised by everyone but others who may not be good in academics but are very good with other skills like arts, sports etc are looked down upon for their poor academic standards.'
'Please tell me this is /s'
'Exactly. IQ is highly correlated with high educational qualifications and just like a girl is born with  skin color she is also born with a certain IQ. Why is one discrimination not ok but the other is?'
"Totally agree, I have a friend who's smart and beautiful, I always tell her she can go far in life but she says she just can't see herself in college. It's not something she ever thought about. She just wants to get married and look after kids and may be work part time if money is low. \n\nI respect her decision, these days we are actively pushing girls to work and go job but at the same time old school girls are still quite amazing. I am sure many of us guys here would love to have a wife like that who care for family and it would be good for kids too if their mom is not always out working. Who are we are tell a girl she's not good enough wife if she doesn't want higher education? You are looking for marriage, not hiring an employee."
'come on man. be happy with something'
'I am not sure if you\'re serious or trolling,but the idea is to go beyond looks. "Not everyone can be qualified" is true upto some extent but it\'s something that one can try to change. At the end, everyone has got some talent and it should be considered in search of  potential partner.'
'This is a sensible response but how would you know about these qualities when looking for a person thru an advt? Everyone says they are funny, outgoing, likes to travel and a photographer. Everyone is looking for an understanding partner who treat other half of family as their own and all that.'
"> Why not focus on people's inner qualities such as how good of a person they are?\n\nHow do you quantify these things? The entire point of having a form is to be able quantify the criteria that you want your would be spouse to have. If 100 people are interested in one guy/girl, how should this guy/girl sift through so many prospects? Spend time with each of them? That's probably asking too much."
">Given how higher education, especially elite universities, is strongly correlated - but not exclusive - with upper caste communities, I don't see this as much better.\n\nNot really, I'd say it's correlated with people from stable financial backgrounds, which includes lower castes too.\n\n>\n> Why not focus on people's inner qualities such as how good of a person they are? Why is everything so transactional. \n\nThat'd be wonderful, the only problem is there's no way to measure it, the only way you sorta can is to actually live with the potential partner for some time before deciding to marry. But then that's not an arranged marriage in the traditional sense...\n\n\n"

'This is so beautiful! '
'Amazing pics, it snowed 3 inches here in Washington like two days ago. Never knew it snows that much in Himachal, wonder how much the land rates are in your village! Stay warm and i was thinking of an idea, a thin sheet of electrically heated metal on the roof top might help you with clearing the snow. '
'Just wow ! '
'AWESOME!!!! We have once been to Subathu from Chandigarh to man a Himalayan Car Rally(?). The village was just heaven and people were more than generous. Mountains must have better roads now but 10 yrs back it was a helluva drive back in dark. You are lucky. Stay warm and safe.'
"Here in Germany, the municipality works over time during winters, clearing roads and highways. People also are very well aware and have all the tools required to remove snow from their homes, cars etc. There isn't a single second of outage of any services. Power, public transport etc works just like any other day. I can only imagine the chaos it would have created if it happened in India.\n\nWe already have days and some times weeks of power outages during the monsoons!"
'Luck had nothing to do with it'
'Not too bad :), we are prepared.'
'**Electricity:** It takes a hit due to old trees falling and breaking the lines or older wooden poles falling, the bijli board is very responsive though and most outages get corrected in a few days and since they are understaffed its a given that the locals will help and provide them tea/snacks. Since the kebabs in our freezer were slowly unfreezing, our linesman got a nice treat when they repaired our line!\n\n**Water:** Most villages get water twice a week if not once, in deep winter, the lines from your storage tank to the house is most prone to freezing and then it bursts. The solution is to have valves at both ends and empty the pipes of any water during the night, we bubble wrap our pipes to add a insulating layer.\n\n**Roads:** Since we are on an MDR, the NH gets priority first, then the nearest exit to the NH is cleared, then the other roads get cleared. Once cleared by the JCB, crews lay sand on the slippery parts. This time we had 4-5 ft of snow at 9000ft, so the roads were certified safe and open only after 6 days by the PWD, the state buses only ply once its officially cleared. Most people with older folk in our area maintain a second home below the snow line, where they shift to before the snow comes (or go to a reltives home), so the population reduces by a good 60-70%.\n\n\n\n'
"I know, my cousins in upstate NY also haven't got much snow as yet. Once we light up the fireplace the snow clears up pretty soon, though. Will keep that suggestion in mind when building a home here. Stay warm there."
"There's no comparison between the two, but the PWD does do its best here, sand is kept next to the roads, the snow clearing JCB's are stationed in their positions and the crews start clearing the roads in order of priority. With most snowy roads in Himachal above 7000ft in mountainous terrain it does make it difficult.  Trees do fall and lines break, and people in the hills are prepared for these contingencies.  30 years ago the roads were shut for months, its improving bit by bit."
"2 Mbps is the best one gets here, and it's prone to minor outages every day, major ones weekly. Once the backbone is more robust I believe it can happen. "

'not every househas a covered garage. \n\nabout water percolating, that doesnt happne very easily. cars are usually pretty good at not letting that in. secondly, if you actually leave your car  out long enough for all the snow to melt into water, then it just trickles down. usually the best practise is to get the snow out while its still fresh and has not converted into hard ice due to lot of cold or melted into water due to sun'
"Hey there, we are in the village of Thanedhar. We have a couple of lovely resorts here - Banjara Thanedhar, and Seetalvan Orchard Kotgarh. Both are closed in the winters though. Look up Airbnb too - Grandma Stokes Guesthouse.\n\n17kms before us on NH22 is Narkanda at 9000ft, one can stay at the Tethys resort there, there's some skiing and hiking as the snow is good. Be prepared for road closures, -10 temperatures in Narkanda and no electricity, Tethys has a backup generator though. \n\n\nThe route ahead from Shimla would be on the NH22, namely Shimla- Kufri-Theog-Mathiana-Narkanda, you can always visit the Kotgarh Thanedhar are from Narkanda, which would be 30-45 mins from there. Get an experienced driver, and a 4x4 if driving in the winters and on snow! \n\nThe fruit season (cherries and apricot) start in May end, and that's a great time to come as well and escape the heat.\nCheers\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5nq7in/a_few_pics_of_snow_in_our_village_in_himachal_np/dcdprs4/?context=10"

"Helmet 101:\n\n* But a helmet that fits snugly. The new helmet will be tight for few days. Bear with it, and let it break-in(the inner foam will loosen adapt to your head-shape). The helmet lining tend to loosen over time and a loosely fit helmet is no good than no helmet. It will come off your head in the event of crash.\n\n* While buying helmet, wear it and shake your head. It shouldn't dangle on its own. Also your cheeks should be puffy inside the helmet. That means its perfect fit.\n\n* Buy an helmet that is 7 to 8% of your ride value. Don't buy a Duke 390 or Pulsar 200 and get a roadside helmet.\n\n* Half face open helmets used mostly by scooter and RE users are no good. Your Jaw is the first to bear the impact. Always, always buy a full face helmet. Half helmets are for aliens and teletubbies!\n\n* Look for ECE or DOT certificate at the back of helmet. those ISI are mostly fake. ECE and DOT are rigorous testing and have standard testing measures. Google *shark helmet testing*. Check for ratings.\n\n* Use a Balaclava. It avoids your inner lining of helmet from stinking, absorb sweat and UV protection. The below one acts as a air filter too.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.in/Gear-Pro-Plus-Face-Black/dp/B01ALULL9C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483434569&sr=8-1&keywords=le+pro+mask\n\n* Your helmet lining can be replaced. You need not buy a new one cause the old lining smell bad or sagged. Just visit a shop and replace.\n\n* Avoid helmet with a dark/tinted visor. Though it may look cool and effective under the sun its a pain  at night. You need to keep your visors open at night and end up getting dirt/bugs to eyes. Instead get a helmet with clear visor or swap a tinted visor to clear visor available at all shops. Wear sunglasses to the inside of clear visor and get the best of both.\n\n* Always keep your helmet on the floor. A helmet dropped from a height of 2 to 3 feet might develop minor cracks, say from top of the table. These minor hair-line kinda cracks cannot be inspected and can lead to breaking of helmet into two at the event of crash.\n\n* Get a helmet with D ring strap. It's used in racing and holds good in crash. ( which is common in LS2 and above brands)\n\n* Clean visor with micro fibre cloth to avoid scratches. Don't let stains to dry as its hard to remove later without scratches.\n\n* If you purchase a new helmet, the will be a rubber piece next to your nose inside the visor. Don't throw that away. It's a fog protector and prevents fogging when you breathe during standstill traffic.\n\n* Even helmet have life. A helmet no matter how costly is good for only up to 5 to 7 years max depending on its quality. An older helmet is also as good as no helmet as it's linings and materials deteriorate too.\n\n* Replace helmet if you crashed with it. A crashed helmet needs retirement though it may appear as a small scratch externally.\n\n* Get a helmet lock. Your precious helmet needs protection too!\n\nBrand suggestion: \n\nLS2- Many fakes in market, get from reputed store (4-6k)\n\nMT- Good and affordable(6-8k)\n\nHJC- costlier than MT,  but better in other aspects(8-10k)\n"
"I have seen many people who have a good helmet but they won't lock it. It is as good as having no helmet."
"I feel so proud after reading this thread lol. \n\n* ALWAYS wear a helmet. Full face. Half-face and top helmets are only for style. \n\n* Use indicators like they're your hands only while in the road, because your hands are too busy with the throttle, clutch and brakes. \n\n* Don't be a moron and overtake from the left. Especially bikes. Even on highways. \n\nI followed these rules and managed to ride from BLR to Tumkur.. On my 110cc scooter. Wasn't a hurried ride at all and I had a great time. "

If they still refuse to learn, meh.\n\nOTOH, protect yourself with dashcams or whatever else, in case you happen to run over a helmetless biker.\n\nedit: forgot to mention, it is probable that I am alive only because I wore a helmet while riding my *bicycle*. One person died in the accident, one had his leg amputated. There is a probability my head was saved because of the helmet I was wearing. My legs were saved because for some reason unconsciousness/physics decided to make me tuck and roll. I had little to do with being alive, but there is probability the helmet I wore saved me."

"Yes. Honestly, people who don't wear helmets, deserve it. Hate me all you want for saying it, but they do deserve it if they have it coming for them.\n\nNow on the other hand, people should learn from such retards and wear the god damn helmet. I don't understand what's their problem to just wear one. They think they're special for some reason, makes em proud to show their face while riding without a helmet. Just so you know, if you're one of the people who likes to ride without a helmet on, you deserve whats coming at you 100%. And no one will take your side if anything happens. Its literally a loss-loss situation in every possible scenario."
"Slightly off topic, but honestly, I find 2 wheelers very irritating.

"You are right here. But what do you mean by the time has passed to speak of his cult? How will we organise ourselves in a manner that Trump and people like Trump don't have their way? By understanding their ways and countering them efficiently. And so it is doubly important to be able to discuss his tactics. \n\nScott Adams being white has nothing to do with his observations. In fact him being white gives him the vantage point to be able to look at why Trump could be appealing to a certain kind of people. It is like you alleging that I can't speak about Modi's cult image and make observations therein just because I have the luxury of being a Hindu.\n\nI'm sorry but I find nothing wrong in making detached observations. All of us would love to believe Trump is a total dunce, point to his failures in businesses etc., but we KEEP falling for the narrative that he is a total loser. He is a fairly successful businessman and now the fucking POTUS. And once we are able to accept that fact (it is a fact, however bitter it is) we can speak of how he pulled this shit off. That's what Scott Adams is doing. Thats what we should be open to discuss and EFFICIENTLY oppose. "

'It appears that the reason cited for not providing an answer (to a question that remains unspecified, the Edits notwithstanding) is technical.\n\nThe RTI Act exists to provide \'information\' and specifies what that constitutes within its framework. If you did indeed ask those exact \'questions\' in the manner they\'re worded hereon, consider framing your question(s) differently to solicit an answer.\n\nAlso, rule of thumb, I have noted from personal experience that it helps if you word questions to appear general and impersonal rather than specific/personal questions. For example, question 1 may be impersonally worded to say, "Which organisation (GOI, UIDAI, NPCI, respective Bank, etc.) is liable for financial losses to citizens that may occur from misuse and/or misappropriation of biometric data?"\n\nMight also be a good idea to steer clear of ad hominem, melodrama, and hyperbole.\n\nEdit: Formatting.'

Go through the bill to read the liability clauses. If anything is ambiguous, you can probably ask if any notifications have been issued clarifying the said sections, but you are not obliged to an answer on this under the RTI Act.\n\nThis was true in UPA era, and remains true in Modi era.

But when it comes to marriage, once you get married you cannot get out of marriage without the other person allowing to it. \n\nConsidering India where there are loads of arranged marriages and many forced or persons don\'t exactly know their partners properly, not allowing divorce without partners consent is not exactly progressive. It\'s just like forced marriages. I haven\'t seen anyone speak against this oppression of forcing people to stay in marriages. All this talk of banning unilateral divorce for men instead of talking about allowing unilateral divorce for women shows this issue is not about barbaric laws. It\'s about muslims. \n\nTriple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It\'s not medieval or barbaric. It\'s pretty progressive. The only objection which women\'s rights activists can say against it is that it\'s available only for men. But when instead of that, when they talk about banning unilateral divorce for men also, I cannot take them seriously. \n\nIts not just men, Muslim women also have options to end marriage unilaterally. There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law. \n\n1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it\'s not included by default. \n\n2) Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage(Khula) - When the wife cannot tolerate her husband or doesn\'t like him she can file for divorce. This doesn\'t require the consent of her husband. Also it\'s available only under Muslim Personal Law. \n\nIn all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don\'t see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?\n\nIn fact BJP government dropped the Irretrievable breakdown of marriage for grounds for divorce.\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-make-divorce-easier-may-be-dropped/article6910089.ece\n\n\nGroups opposing the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill contend that it will cause an increase in "illegitimate and live-in relations and thereby a fall of the institution of marriage and family values."\n\nSince then the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recommended the inclusion of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.\n\nBJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women\'s rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.\n\nEdit: credits azfun123\n'
"Pure bullshit. I read the judgement. And it's just an opinion from the judge. He didn't strike down triple talaq. \n\nWhy should a secular state gives it's own opinions on how people live their lives? \n\nhttp://barandbench.com/allahabad-high-court-not-struck-triple-talaq/\n\n1) A 53 year old man met a 23 year woman and fell in love and married her.\n\n2) The 23 year old woman's mother started harassing her. \n\n3) Then they both filed a petition from  police harassment and  from the girl's mother. It's unclear who is harassing them. \n\n4) Then the judge went full kulcha mode and started giving opinions unrelated to the case. \n\n\n\n>On\xa0a\xa0specific\xa0query\xa0as\xa0to\xa0when\xa0and\xa0why\xa0the\xa0instant\xa0divorce was\xa0effected,\n\xa0the\xa0second\xa0petitioner\xa0would\xa0state\xa0that\xa0to\xa0contract second marriage \xa0 he \xa0 has \xa0 divorced \xa0 his \xa0 wife, \xa0 no \xa0 other \xa0 reason \xa0 is pleaded\xa0or\xa0stated\xa0before\xa0the\n\xa0Court.\n\n\n>\xa0The\xa0Islamic\xa0law\xa0gives\xa0to\xa0the\xa0man\xa0primarily\xa0the faculty of\xa0 dissolving\xa0the\xa0 marriage,\xa0if\xa0the\xa0wife, by\xa0her\xa0indocility\xa0or her\xa0bad\xa0character,\xa0 renders\xa0 the\xa0\nmarried life\xa0unhappy;\xa0but\xa0in\xa0the absence\xa0of\xa0serious\xa0reasons,\xa0no\xa0man\xa0can\xa0\njustify\xa0a\xa0divorce,either\xa0in the\xa0eye\xa0of\xa0religion\xa0or\xa0the\xa0law.\n\nThe judge is basically saying you cannot divorce without a reason. Falling in love with another woman is not a reason according to this judge. Once you get married you need to stay together till you die. The guy has no right to choose another wife.\n\nIt's basically a version of /r/niceguys. You know if you are a nice guy/girl, then there can be no divorce. People like the judge and majority of Indians are like that. There is no concept of love or anything. Basically if the guy/girl is good with no fault you need to stay married together forever. It's like the aunties asking why you can't marry if the guy is good and has a good job. Love etc is all nonsense. Now don't bring in maintenance, alimony etc because the case is not about that. The case is about reasons for divorce. \n\nPeople can't discuss anything rationally without downvoting. Every time triple talaq comes up, any opposing opinion gets heavily downvoted. People here don't realize this is not about triple talaq or religious things. It's about unilateral divorce/divorce without a reason. Those guys are trying to ban that. Basically in Indian culture once you get married you are supposed to stay together forever. Now please don't try to justify that and say it's progressive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
"Absolutely! The sooner the better!\n\nAnd while we are at it why can't we go ahead and abolish 'casteism' too? Its unconstitutional and involves all major religions in India and will make a good qualification for Uniform Civil Code!"
"When my secular state govt controls major revenue generating temples and their associated assets I'd expect them to facilitate such yatras or whatever is else is required for sustaining my religious beliefs as non Hindu places of worship are not under government control and are even exempt from tax on earnings unlike Hindu temples and they can do whatever they please to further their religious interests (which is a good thing) . To maintain a level playing field state should either get out of the business of running temples and treat every place of worship equally or not be shy to actively pursue interests of the Hindu community \n\n"
'This is actually a very good move for Indian Muslims. This is one issue where you can see a divide between the fundamentalist and the more populous normal Muslim populations in India.\n\nMost normal Muslims (especially women) are against the triple talaq as it happens now (with this nonsense "I texted you three talaq so we are divorced"), and it\'s not even allowed in many Islamic countries (even in Pakistan it is banned).\n\nMost normal Muslims see it as a warped view of their religion (and in fact this is how they view a lot of the fundamentalists\' ways, at least in India), so this kind of victory really helps everyone.'
"There is a difference though. Modi won't use the parliament to overrule it like Rajiv Gandhi did. "
"> This is a Allahabad HC judgment, meaning it isn't binding on any of the other States HC and obviously isn't binding on the SC, and just has a persuasive value for reference.\n\nYeah, but as long as other high courts do not pass a judgment contradictory to it, isn't it applicable to whole of India? Just like Delhi HC decriminalised homosexuality before SC overturned the decision."
'> Total anarchy\n\nOh my God does anybody even understand the meaning of the terms they throw around randomly.'
'I am actually a Muslim. All the ones I know think that triple talaq as it is done in India is wrong.\n\nThe problem (i.e. why people believe that most Muslims think otherwise) is that we see far more people against triple talaq who are non-Muslims. Muslim clerics and other sections of the society also speak out against triple talaq, but then they are propped up by people who are using the issue to push for removal of all religious law (just look at this comment section for proof).\n\nThe religious law is very important to Indian Muslims because Indian Muslims are not very knowledgeable about Islam (on average). They rely on the law to understand their religion. So they value the religious law, but they do also want it to be done correctly. Even in Pakistan TT is banned. Why is it so hard to do here? Because it is often a cause paraded by non-Muslims as a pretext to remove Muslim law. And Muslims in India cling to their religion rather than study it. So they will like to keep everything the way it is now rather than hand over control of their religious laws to non-Muslims.\n\nWhen Hindus began to change the problems in their religion, it was something a fellow Hindu was explaining, with compassion, care and understanding. In this case, many Muslims see malice in the intention of those who want to abolish TT and thus they will not be for it (even though they think TT is wrong). They will be hush hush about it, while the mullahs protest its change.'
'So this means you can safely get rid / abolish  triple talaq, which is one way traffic and still have options to follow your own law? \n\nAlso curious on who takes care of women after the divorce in muslim law? are they expected to pay any fines at a go or monthly compensation for non working women?'

"but I love the 'soldier' comments.."
'>Also curious on who takes care of women after the divorce in muslim law? are they expected to pay any fines at a go or monthly compensation for non working women?\n\nUsually the women is given a payment in the case of divorce (like her mehr), but other than this there is nothing (so no recurring payment or alimony).\n\nThis is also true in much of the world, no? In US this is how divorce is done. Woman is not entitled to earning of a man who she is not married to.'
"> Also curious on who takes care of women after the divorce in muslim law?\n\nThe same guys who took care of her before marriage. \n\nI seriously don't understand people who bring in the alimony thing in Islam. Alimony is there in Islam. But just not from the husband. Her father, her brothers, her sons and so on are responsible for her maintenance. If all of them are dead, then the state is responsible.  In Hindu personal law, after marriage her husband's family becomes her new family. After the death of her husband, the father-in-law is responsible for her maintenance. I don't agree with that. \n\nIslam is just like any modern live-in or girlfriend-boyfriend relationship. It's only for the duration of marriage that he is responsible for maintenance. After divorce they are just like strangers just like any boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.  Why should the husband be responsible after divorce? Why not her parents, her brothers or her family's side? \n\n\n\n"
'>Women are just domestic slaves for you. They cannot work\n\nHow have you come to believe this? In Islam women certainly can work. In fact, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh is a woman. The first wife of the Prophet was also a working merchant.'

I dont know if she was married of as a kid or not but she was a lot older than my mom atleast. She used to tell my mom how her parents and even brothers regularly pester her for money and how she wishes she dies. She died while travelling with her family for a holiday. Her sons and daughters all gone with her in 1 car crash. 1 good thing was that the Sheikh treated her well. A lot of times these peados pretty much use these girls for sex and then either divorce them or make them maids.\n\n\n\nThe thing that messed me up the most is that her brother wanted money to buy a CBZ. He even turned up once to our house in India for help in treating his mom. The proper wolloping he got from mom and dad was good to see '

"Let's not forget that Prophet himself had a child wife. These paedophiles probably think their behavior is justified because their Prophet himself was a paedophile. If the behavior wasn't sanctioned by Islam, Muslim men wouldn't be taking it multiple and underage wives to satisfy their sick perversions."
'It\'s doubtful the girls\' parents accede to the \'sale\' with full knowledge of the fate that awaits their daughters:\n\n> The case had come to light earlier this week, after Fathima approached the Falaknuma police station, alleging that her husband\'s sister, Ghousia Begum, and brother-in-law, Sikander, \'sold\' the girl to the Omani man for Rs 5 lakh.\n\n> "My husband works as a daily wage labourer in a marriage hall. When Ghousia and Sikander approached me with a marriage proposal for my minor daughter, I **rejected it then and there**," the complaint states.\n\n> "**Without my knowledge**, the duo approached my daughter and lured her by showing her photos and videos of the lavish Gulf lifestyle. **In spite of my objection**, my daughter was married off to the sheikh," she wrote.\n\n[Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/deception-lies-and-trafficking-how-77-yr-old-omani-sheikh-married-teenager-hyderabad-67051)\n\nSeems like the girls parents are assured of a good life for the girls, and a \'sweetener\' is thrown in for good measure which gives the \'sale\' label to the entire affair.'
'I have an idea, maybe hard to implement it, but I\'ll still write it here for reference. Why not we (redditors, bloggers, twitteratis and others in social media) find out the names of the good cops (such as the ones who cracked this case) and celebrate them and make them famous? This will achieve two things:\n\n1. It will give some fame to these selfless public servants (which they more than deserve).\n2. It will motivate the other corrupt and lazy guys in the cops dept to act more sincerely and honestly.\n\nInstead of spreading the rounds about useless "X vz Y" arguments and circle-jerking, here is a great way to help in nation building. I really hope such a thing happens, but not sure whether it will happen or not. The big thing about making things trend is that one person cannot make it, it has to be a group motivated thing. So, me alone cannot do anything more than wish something.\n\n**Edit**\n\nAs a corollary, we can trend the other side of the story too. If a cop makes a mistake (like those cops who gave protection to Baba Rah Rahim instead of putting him behind bars), then lets find their names and give them some negative publicity too, so that others think a hundred times before making similar mistakes.'

We can't have revolutions my friend. It is a step by step gradual improvement. \n\nAlso one thing you're forgetting is that these politicians /bureaucrats also come from the people.

Another example is the recent Baba Ram Rahim's case of course. If the general public's attention wasn't there in the social media, that case would have been quietly hushed up, right?"
"> Objectively, a cop decides to become a cop. Hence, all they should be doing is their job. if they do their job, they are no different from anyone else doing their job. \n\nYep, what you are saying is true for most jobs, but Indian government service is a bit different. Imagine you are the head of the department where only 4-5 out of 100 people are doing their jobs sincerely! (yes, that's the condition of our country if you consider the vast region and include rural lands too). How will you motivate the remaining 95% to work? Apart from scolding the wrong-doers (which should be obvious), is it not appropriate to reward the honest ones too? (Especially since they have to fight the system so hard to stay honest)."
'Contraceptives are not haram even in orthodox Sunni Islam actually, that is the scholarly opinion. It\'s an interesting point to note.\n\nEven abortion is allowed up to the 16th week of the pregnancy.\n\nThis has to do with some differences in scripture between Islam and another Abrahamic faith infamous for shunning contraceptives and abortion, i.e. Christianity.\n\nIn the Bible life is conceived as starting in the sperm cell, so "blocking" the flow of these sperm cells is a bit like murder. In Islam however, a hadtih of Muhammad specifies a particular time that angels breath life into a fetus. At anytime before this then (the 16th week of pregnancy), the fetus doesn\'t exactly have a soul. Accordingly, even sperm isn\'t seen as having that sort of "spiritual essence" in itself, that\'s breathed into the fetus later. Accordingly, most scholars believe that contraception is fine and can be useful, the reason Muslims have children is moreso because having children is considered a good thing, not because contraceptives are unIslamic, any stigma against contraceptives has cultural and not religious roots if anything religion can be used as a tool to encourage contraception in this case. \n\nhttps://www.al-islam.org/islamic-edicts-on-family-planning/opinion-scholars-and-jurisprudents-ahl-sunnah-relation-family\n\nUnlike Christianity, sex within marriage is also a good thing in Islam (massive emphasis on \'within marriage\'). Muhammad actually discouraged his followers from praying all night to the point of ignoring their wives\' needs and practicing celibacy to get closer to god, this was seen as something not good. In a lot of these stories it seems the wife\'s concern is more "our sex life is dead" more than "I can\'t have babies", although the latter is something troubling too within Islam. Accordingly the Islamic golden age actually saw many "pillow books" published, which are basically books which give sex advice.\n\nMy point is that I think there\'s actually an Islamic basis for ok\'ing married couples having purely recreational sex with contraceptive usage.'

"This brings back memories... \n\nMy grandparents lived in Srirangam for over 2 decades and my grandmom even had a *season pass* for this temple (direct access to all Sannidhi's/sanctum sanctorum) and she was allowed to bring family members along. Every summer vacation I would go visit them. We would wake up at 4:30 and go to the temple around 6:00AM. In fact I did my 2nd and 3rd grades in Srirangam too. \n\nAnd oh, interesting piece of trivia, the town of Srirangam is an island, bordered between Kaveri and Kollidam (a distributary of Kaveri). \n\nThe temple is huge, the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world IIRC. Has so many inscriptions on the walls (Mainly in Old Tamizh). Some of the festivities that happen are insane fun, for example the Vaiyyali or the horse ride is where the Uthsavar (moving god) is taken on a horse (not a real one) and the men carrying it run crazy in dizzying circles carrying Aranganathar (Ranganathaswamy). Here is a sample - https://twitter.com/svbadri/status/856315818442977280"
'Good Lord this is beautiful..'
'I find Tamil temples so vibrant because of the sculptures on the gopurams. They are literally bursting from the seams with life!'
'I like seeing architectures in temples. I wish they were a little empty. I am not religious, but I find mythology fascinating and the quietness in the temples quite relaxing.'
'The gopuram on the last aka the temple tower, was unfinished for hundreds of year, before being rebuilt in its full glory by the 44th Jeer of the Ahobila Mutt, from a Vadakalai acharya, even though the temple follows the Thenkalai sampradaya. The gopuram was rebuilt purely using public donations and was completed only in 1978. This temple, is the foremost vaishnavite temple shrine of them all, and is rank one. All other vaishnavite Temples send tributes to this temple, during its annual festival, to attest to this fact. \n\nThis temple has been historically raided twice by the marauding Khilji forces, before being restored to its glory by the Vijayanagara kings.

"\n>The temple is huge, the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world IIRC.\n\nIt is. However Angkorwat in Cambodia can also be classified as functioning as there is a big [Lord Vishnu statute](https://depositphotos.com/11464962/stock-photo-ancient-vishnu-hindu-god-statue.html) in the main Angkorthom temple which is still worshiped and rituals are performed daily. Although that's about the only place in the whole temple complex (largest religious place in the world) where Hindu Gods are worshipped. Rest of it is either barren or have some small functioning Buddhist temples. \n"
'Such sweet memories always bring happiness...'
'One more interesting piece of trivia is that Vaishnavism is almost exclusively practiced only by a certain insufferable brahmin subsect in TN. The idea of Vaishnavite monothiesm was highly appealing to the muslm-convert kings of Vijayanagara as it was the closest thing to anything abrahamc within Hindusm. These brahmins played that to their advantage and turned what was essentially supposed to be a caste free ideology into a stupid cult. No wonder that to this day, all Tamils including other brahmins don’t look at these cultists with anything but disdain.\n'
"Isn't the Delhi Swaminarayan Temple the largest functioning temple now?  \n.  \nOrlov's Diamond. Interesting story about that heist. Not sure whether true. Where's the other eye?"
'In general: Try going pre 7am types, on non peak days. Avoid weekends, holidays, festivals, vacations, etc times. '
"Fun Fact: \n\nMany of the ancient hindu's temple does not require for one to be religious. \n\nThey were more of educational spots.\n\nLike the bottom row in ancient temples were always animals and Kids stuff, Elephants Horses etc. \n\nAs you grow. educational stuff, Universe, mythology, wars, lores.\n\nFollowed by adult stuff. Sex Positions, Including gay acceptance.\n \nThen finally, inner peace and godly stuff. Or what ever the temple specializes in.\n"
"hahahaha, shebba Anton dei...\n\nAnyway, you bring up a couple of interesting points. \n\n> Vaishnavism is almost exclusively practiced only by a certain insufferable brahmin subsect in TN\n\nThenkalai Iyengars. So TamBrahms are further divided into 2 - Iyers and Iyengars. And one type of these Iyengars is Thenkalai Iyengars, the other being Vadakalai (and all others being ecchakalai huehuehue). Its easy to spot the difference between the two - [how they wear their *naamam* on their forehead](http://www.deccanherald.com/page_images/original/2015/06/16/483788.gif). \n\n> Vaishnavite monothiesm\n\nYes, they are interesting in the fact that they pray only to Aranganathar (Vishnu) and consider him as the one and only god. Most other gods are not really prayed to (unless an Avatar of the great god himself) and are considered to exist to serve the ultimate one. Hardcore Iyengars won't even pray to Shiva or any of the other popular gods or sport [Vibuti (pattai)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UcfWaNTqqnQ/VqgcCQ9yxJI/AAAAAAAABxY/U5VXnX9ZL6A/s1600/2014-12%2BFacing%2BIndia%2527s%2BCow%2BBelt%2B%252822%2529.jpg). \n\n"

"It's true"
'That is a fantastic point of you!'
'I meant the paint on the gopurams. They just kill the beauty of these magnificent structures'
"I wouldn't be so certain. Those Greek statues that were colored weren't perennially outdoors in the full-blown sun for centuries, thigh sure, their indoors vases still have colors today. White ones were Marble statues that were never painted. \n\nExterior paint tech is only a modern invention, and in any case modern paint offers no aesthetic advantage over the marvelous color of the rock on these buildings. "
'According to many modern experts in the field, almost all "white" Greek statues were painted.\n\nSusanne Ebbinghaus (Hanfmann curator of ancient art at the Harvard University Art Museums) says as much in [this article](http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/11/dazzlers-html), with some reconstructions included.\n\n[Here](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors-17888/) are some more reconstructions by the German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann, including some that were definitely outdoors (like the temple capstone in one of the images).\n\nBuildings like the Parthenon were [once brightly coloured](https://www.livescience.com/649-parthenon-riot-color.html). Long-lasting exterior paint may be somewhat modern, but these buildings and statues were maintained continuously during their time.\n\nAnd if you look at the reconstructions, they all look extremely kitschy from a modern viewpoint - perhaps even more so than the modern paint on many Dravidian temples.\n\nThat being said, I do agree with you that the South Indian temples look far better without the paint. The massive unpainted temples in Kanchipuram (like Sri Ekambaranathar and Sri Varadharaja Perumal) are beautiful, and the Great Living Chola Temples (especially the Brihadeeswarar temples at Thanjavur and Gangaikonda Cholapuram) were breathtaking.'
"Tamizh is how it is supposed to be pronounced, I can't explain it in words. Look it up on YouTube and it should be clear  "
'Thanks for that fascinating bit of history, esp the Parthenon. I didnt think to look beyond marble sculptures as the white relics from greek times. Insightful!\n'
"It's pronounced like the Marathi letter ळ or how Americans pronounce 'R' in any word.\n\n"
"That makes sense. I looked it up for the pronounciation and hadn't realize it was such, thanks for clarifying"
"I'm guessing it is because Tamizh already has two 'L' sounds :\n\nல - Just like how you'd pronounce 'L'\n\nள - A deeper 'L', where you roll your tongue to and pronounce 'L' from the back of your palate.\n\nAnd then comes ழ, which is written as 'zh'. "

Truly being devoted to their ideals would need them to first understand what those ideals are, through effort, and then work on it, through effort.\n\nAll you got to do is ask yourself this; Do you think any of these people care about either the cow or their religion?\n\nNever attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.\n\nI think Mr. Sisodia made a very valid point here.\n\n"

'Anyone want to make a poll on: 1) India should be for Hindus only/mutlicultural 2) There should be no beef sold in India/its okay to sell 3) View cow as god/its just like other animals 4) A true hindu is a vegetarian/does not eat beef ? Lets see how it goes. \n\nPS: How about legality of dog meat in dog loving countries. They love dogs, but will they allow dog meat to be sold? '

"Damn right. Chaos is natural, order takes effort. \n \nI can't wait for this government to go to hell so all Indians of every caste creed and religion can live peacefully.\n  \nThe persistence and perpetuation of all personal laws, predicated on religious belief or religious-cultural customary practice, present a secular state with a peculiar conundrum: upholding the freedom to practice the religion of one’s choice, and simultaneously upholding and guaranteeing individual freedoms, and freedom from discrimination on grounds of race, caste, creed, sex and so on.\n\nHowever, all religions are fundamentally inegalitarian, inherently patriarchal and exclusive. No religion believes in equality as a fundamental right, and as an essential human condition. All religions actively endorse patriarchal control and privilege, and all practice exclusion in one form or another, albeit none as systematically and abhorrently as Hinduism.\n\nWhen church and state come together, then, either by default or design, all three features – inequality, patriarchal control and exclusionary practices – are consolidated. What also gets consolidated are patriarchal attitudes and assertions within religion, society, the polity and, most critically, the state itself."
">India is secular because leaders like Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar forced secularism on Indians. Post-partition, the majority never wanted to be secular.\n\nI don't fully agree. The secularism also derives power from the common people. Even though UP looks like a shithole nowadays, but parallel to this, there is a whole Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, where Hindus and Muslims respect each other's values and often participate in each other's customs. Ustad Bismillah Khan famously played Shehnai at Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. A lot of Hindus revere Sufi saints like Salim Chisti (I am a Hindu and my mother used to take me there regularly), Hazrat Nizamuddin. Meos in Haryana are Muslims but their culture is very Hinduised. I have come across guys with names like Rahul Khan. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meo_(ethnic_group). People in villages still live in communal harmony.\n\nI am giving these examples to point out that secular cultural traits and traditions have been in our society for long and have continued after partition too. These have not been forced by any external agent but rather built by people themselves with mutual harmony and trust. Secularism cannot be protected if common people don't support. Have faith in people of India. Sure, we have had challenging times like Partition, 1984 Riots, Kashmiri Pandit Exodus, Babri Masjid Demolition, 2002 Riots, but we have always gone back to the secular ways of life.\n"
"While I agree India is not secular because of Hinduism, the brand of secularism pushed by the likes of Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar, secularism based on equality, is the reason we are in this predicament right now. Different religions have different laws for things like marriage, divorce and even apostasy. Say what you will about RSS, in theory their proposal for a Uniform Civil Code is actually the only thing that can stop this violence. Only I'd rather have a left wing party enforce this same law instead, since we won't be suspicious of ulterior motives behind the move."

"
'>the secular, tolerant image of Hinduism is a very, very modern thing mainly due to the reforms of people such as Raja Rammohan Roy\n\nThere was also a lot of focus on projecting \'secularism\' as a virtue up until the early 90s.

Once people weren\'t getting their news and entertainment from a state owned medium telling them "unity is strength" - people reverted to a more tribal mindset. '

Surely, that's not because US is overpopulated. They are 16 times less populated than India. \n\nThe reason is that certain schools are in high demand and the authorities devise a system to screen and take the best in (as they see fit). \n\nPersonally, like you, I also believe that it isn't right to put a young kid through this. I am just pointing out the reason why they do it. \n\nAmbani school in Mumbai receives thousands of applications for about ~~50~~ 100 seats each year. They therefore have a screening system which takes into account the background of the parents and the child's interview. It's though a different matter that most of it is for show, as admissions are through jugad and contacts. \n\nSome schools in Mumbai like Bombay Scottish and Arya Vidya Mandir do not interview children or parents.

By virtue of involvement with these initiatives, Sharad is a widely respected figure in the tech industry. His enthusiasm and energy for his causes are unparalleled.\n\n> Also by virtue of his reach into various organisations represented by IndiaStack and its volunteers, including UIDAI, NPCI, SEBI, MeitY and GSTN, Sharad is a powerful figure, perhaps the only one with a reach spanning from small, unfunded startups to the upper bureaucracy of government.

Today the literacy rate for young Indians is close to 90%. 30 years ago it was closer to 50-60%. And even among the literate in the 80s and 90s, far fewer graduated through college. Today there is a greater progression.\n\nYou see the same thing outside of India too. College education in America during the 70s and 80s was generally far more affordable, even counting for inflation, than it is today. Yet the boomers keep whining about "young and spoiled people these days, I worked off my debts much faster". Idiots don\'t understand how little debt that they actually had to pay off when adjusted for inflation. \n\nPlus the premium on a college education in 1980 was *much* greater than it is today, when a master\'s degree is really the new bachelor\'s degree and maybe not even that.

People who went to engineering and graduated back then had to go seek information and work hard to find that information... From their peers, teachers and/or libraries. There was no Wikipedia\n\nWhen they graduated college against all odds, the employer knew that this person was a smart and hard worker. Today\'s college grads are dime a dozen. The term "engineer" has lost its meaning. People have all information at their fingertips but can barely do what\'s required of them\n\nLet\'s face it. Our parents generation took care of a 3-5 person family on a single middle class salary... Today, we\'re unable to do that without complaining on two salaries. We constantly crave instant gratification. We have a lot more "utility" bills like internet, 4 cellphones, full range cable TV, two cars and two two wheelers plus EMIs on a house that we can barely afford\n\nI know y\'all like to feel victimized here but there\'s a decent amount of truth to the boss\'s words'

Many of them got snagged quickly by MNCs for direct international assignments.\n\nThere were very few MNCs hiring in India back in those days.

'Modi was responsible for the big bang as well'
'Kochi metro was well executed under the leadership of DMRC. Both state and Central govt cooperated well on the project. I will say the political credit goes to the former  Kerala CM Omman Chandy . it was his pet project. And 90% of the project was completed under his regime. \n\nCurrent CM Pinarai Vijayan went on to say Modi gave all the support to the project. So Kochi metro is a well executed project irrespective of the political spectrums. We need to be happy that we are getting a world class metro rail but we are focusing on who is taking the credit and who to blame. Typical randia.  '
'I just hope development goes on regardless of who claims to take credit.'
'>It was expected to start by 2006 and complete by 2010. But the project was delayed because the Central Government expressed serious doubts about the economic viability of the project.[11] In 2008 LDF Government under the Chief Minister V. S. Achuthanandan approved the Kochi Metro rail project in a cabinet meeting held on 2nd January 2008 and sent to Central Government for ratification. The Kerala government hoped the Centre would approve a funding structure similar to that used for the Delhi Metro, but they were turned down.[13] The Union Government supported using public–private partnership (PPP) on the build-operate-transfer model.[14] The LDF state government wanted it to be in public sector, which was not accepted to the Central Government. The victory of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the 2011 Kerala legislative assembly elections, changed the scenario in the state[15] and it was decided that the Kochi Metro would follow the Chennai Metro and Delhi Metro models, and would be implemented on a joint venture basis, with investments by the Central and State Government. A Cabinet decision was taken to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. (KMRL) as per orders from Planning Commission and the Union Government for the implementation, operation and maintenance of the metro project. The Public Investment Board (PIB) cleared the project on 22 March 2012 subject to final approval by the Union Cabinet.[17] The Union Government\'s share of the cost would be 20.26%, or ₹1,002.23 crore (US$160 million).[18] On 28 March 2012, at a KMRL board meeting, the decision was taken to entrust the Kochi Metro rail project work to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The number of metro stations on the line was set at 22.[19][20] On 3 July 2012, Union Government gave final clearance to the project. Then Managing Director of KMRL, Tom Jose said, "Now we will sit down with our valued partner, DMRC, and chalk out the way forward, obtaining advice and guidance from former DMRC Chief, E Sreedharan. We aim to complete the project within a span of 3 to 4 years." [21]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Metro\n\nSurely it could\'ve been completed way before in 2010-12 but no one is going to question the previous government about the delay. Public welfare projects being delayed for 5 to 8 years is so normal in India afterall that we are used to it.'

He did what he could - which was a lot - in 10 years and we as citizens have benefitted from his work. I don't think he cared for glory. That was his way.

"To the credit of Modi's campaign team, they pulled in a lot of supporters who got interested in politics because of his campaign. They bought his speeches, propaganda, etc. wholesale, probably because they didn't follow politics before, got all their information from BJP's propaganda networks. The 'recency bias' is because a lot of Modi's young supporters genuinely do not know of anything of the pre-Modi era, except through their own 'closed' information networks.

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Tom Alter, Padma Shri actor and writer, dies aged 67** \n\n ______ \nMUMBAI: Veteran film, television and theatre actor and Padma Shri Tom Alter has died aged 67. The renowned actor and one-time sports writer and author had been battling stage four skin cancer.Alter acted in over 300 movies apart from numerous TV shows, most famously as the gangster Keshav Kalsi in the hit soap opera Junoon which ran for a record five years during the 1990s. In addition to acting, Alter also ventured into direction and was a sports journalist in the 80s and 90s. He was the first person to interview Sachin Tendulkar for TV when the cricketer was yet to debut for India. Alter has written three books, one non-fiction and two fiction, and in 2008 was awarded the prestigious Padma Shri by the Indian government in recognition for his services to the field of arts and cinema.A statement released on behalf of his family said: "It is with sadness we announce the death of Tom Alter, actor, writer, director, Padma Shri, and our dear husband and father. Tom passed away Friday night at home with his family and close family members in attendance. We ask for their privacy to be respected at this time."Born in the hill station of Mussoorie in 1950, Alter was a third-generation American in India who studied at Woodstock School in the Himalayas and then briefly at Yale University in the USA, before returning to India in the early 70s. In 1972, he was one of three men - the others being Benjamin Gilani and Phunsok Ladakhi - chosen from over 800 applicants across north India to be enrolled in at the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India in Pune, where two years later he graduated with a gold medal diploma in acting.Alter\'s first release was Ramanand Sagar\'s Charas in 1976, in which he played the role of superstar Dharmendra\'s boss, a CID official. Among his notable roles during the first decade of his acting career were Satyajit Ray\'s Shatranj Ke Khiladi (1977), Shyam Benega\'s Junoon (1979), Manoj Kumar\'s magnum opus Kranti (1981) and Raj Kapoor\'s Ram Teri Ganga Maili (1985). Other notable directors he worked with during the 70s and 80s were V Shantaram, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Manmohan Desai, Subhash Ghai, Chetan Anand - who gave him his first break in the Dev Anand-starrer Saheb Bahadur - and Vidhu Vinod Chopra, who gave him the pivotal role of the gangster Musa in the critically acclaimed hit Parinda.In the 90s, Alter was seen in many films, prominent among them Mahesh Bhatt\'s Aashiqui, Junoon and Gumrah, Ketan Mehta\'s Sardar and Priyadarshan\'s Kala Pani. During this time, he also acted in regional cinema - Bengali, Assamese, Telegu, Tamil and Kumaoni films. Among his foreign films are Richard Attenborough\'s Gandhi and One Night with the King, in which he acted opposite his idol, the legendary Peter O\'Toole.On TV, Alter\'s leading work came in Junoon, Zabaan Sambhalke, Jugalbandi, Bharat EK Khoj, Ghutan, Shaktimaan, Captain Vyom, Mere Ghar Aana Zindagi and Yahaan Ke Hum Sikandar. Most recently, he was seen in a pivotal role in the ongoing serial Rishton Ka Chakravyuh on Star Plus. At the time of his death, Alter had approximately 16 unreleased films lined up as well as a web series by Eros Now titled Smoke.Throughout his cinematic and television career, Alter remained busy with theatre, having co-founded Motley Productions with Naseeruddin Shah and Gilani in 1979. His prominent stage work includes the two-and-a-half-hour-long solo play in Urdu, \'Maulana\', \'Babur ke Aulaad\', \'Lal Qile ka Aakhri Mushaira\', \'Ghalib ke Khat\', \'Trisanga\', \'Teesveen Shatabdi\', Copenhagen\' and the theatrical reproduction of William Dalrymple \'s \'City of Djinns\'.In early 2017, Alter enacted a festival of his various plays in Hindi, English, Hindustani and Urdu titled titled \'Jashn-e-Maazi: The Play of History\' which featured 19 of his portrayals and adaptations of leading historical figures such as Maulana Azad, Mirza Ghalib, Manto, Saahir Ludhianvi, Rabindranath Tagore, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Alfred Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi.He is survived by his wife Carol, son Jamie , and daughter Afshaan.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'Only watched one movie of his - M Cream. Was very impressive in that. '
'RIP Tom. Respect to all the work you have done and the way you have touched billions of people.'
"honestly i dint know Tom Altar was Indian born and brought up until a few weeks back. I was watching a documentary on Netflix named Beyond Bollywood that showed a struggling Australian actor who seeks Tom Altar's guidance on how to make it in Bollywood. My curiosity piqued after i saw him speaking eloquently in Hindi so i looked up some of his interviews.\n\nHe was born India and went to study at Yale in the 70's during the Vietnam war era but couldn't survive the studies and the gloomy environment in the U.S during that time and kept missing India, he came back to India and took a job as a teacher at a school in Jagadhari, Haryana. Up until that time he wasn't into Indian movies but over there he saw Rajesh Khanna starrer Aradhana and became passionate about acting. He then went to acting school with the likes of Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah.\n\nHe was a true Indian and a great actor, too bad he is no longer with us."
'Tom alter is one of my favorite actor'
'Shocking. RIP Tom Alter. He was a Good Actor.'
'He came to our school once. We were also taken to see a play of his. Seemed like a nice guy.'
'Very good actor and great human being....rip sir'
'I saw his interview recently. Looked fit to me. '
'He spoke hindi with better diction than most son’s and daughters of bollywood today.'
"I didn't realize he was in so many ofy beloved childhood stuff. Rest in peace. "
"He is an Indian born and brought up so it's natural he can speak it. I'm Marathi born, brought up and studied. I can speak English and Hindi both. And a bit of Gujrati.\n\nAnd he was among the most popular face on television in the '90s. People before Cable TV era knows who he is."
'He was the true nationalist.'
'Atleast now we know two things:\n\n1. You are clueless\n\n2. You dont know shit about statistics'
'Mostly because I was too young to understand the concept of acting. I was so afraid of him that whenever he came, I knew something bad is going to happen to the "good guys" or "girls".\n\nAhhh... those good old days.'
'You are technically not wrong. '
"Suryahaguru.\n\n***\n\n^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot. This )^[portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) ^( was created from the phrase 'Suryanshi Mahaguru'.)"
'Yeah, why? I was happy in my speculative land.'
'\n>to be recognised for his heroics.\n\nI believe that the word "bravery" would be better suited than heroics. As heroics has less appropriate connotations as it is also used to imply frivolously risky behaviour. '
'Kudos, great gesture!'
'Pardon my ABCDness, but I\'ve noticed all the articles from Indian based news sources usually describe the victims as "techies" pretty liberally. Is that really common to call people who went from India to US for tech jobs? Just wanted to double check. I got back from India two weeks ago...'
'>The navy veteran is reported to have been harassing Kuchibhotla and Madasani who both worked at GPS-maker Garmin because he thought they were Iranian\n\nSo if it is true it is not racial attack on Indians right?'
'Bless his soul. '
"Who extended the invite?  Article doesn't say...or did I miss it?\n"
'Just help pay for his medical expenses and time off work instead. What will he get by visiting India or us by inviting him?indians can be such emotional fools sometimes'
"Good move by us. I don't know why we aren't raising the issue with US on a discussion on a diplomatic level "
'Indian soft power to be on full display and I am sure we will make a big song & dance about this - which we rightly should.\n\nA good gesture for sure because it takes a lot of guts to intervene in an armed dispute.'
'Where are the hindu trump bhakts now? \n"happy birthday trumpji"  lol'
'Yeah they are the new coolies'
"Most Indian journalists play a lot of DOTA. It's an inside joke."
"No, but you still have to be careful if in the US. All brown people look alike to rednecks. And there's anti-immigrant sentiment to deal with as well."
'External affair Ministries work...I think first of its kind in India.'
'If in Bollywood style, then he will found his love in India but go back to US but his heart will be still in India and after some months he will come back to India to serve in villages. '
"But this guy isn't really your run off the mill engineer. He actually seems to be quite successful working for Garmin as an aviation engineer. Calling him techie seems so lazy."
'just like North Easterners are all chinkis, amirite?'
'Not all terrible people are terrible.'
'We should have him over, put him up at a good hospital and help him with post op and physio therapy care. God knows what its going to cost him. \n\nSoft power, power move. '
"Oh please, don't diss on swades. Look up the movie Bollywood Queen, you might be surprised who the lead is. :D"
'Mammuka movie where he tries to buy awards'
'Watch 4 lions movie its pretty funny.'
"He'd sure like to get treated in India when he has already raised enough funds to finance his treatment in the US. \n\nBecause logic. \n\nInstead India could finance his treatment in his home country.  Now *that* would be a power move. "
"They're still great target practice."
"India has excellent doctors. He can use that money for something else. He'll have recurring medical expenses in the future even after the treatment."
'So.. uh..  Kasaab did nothing wrong, right? '
'Careful mate, ABVP gonna best you up.'
">India has excellent doctors\n\n...whose talents are needed elsewhere. A high profile patient who *can* be treated in the US shouldn't be a priority in a country with a shoddy healthcare system. "
'congrats. more success to you but never forget your roots.'
"I can understand this man, finished Engg without a computer at home, fought with parents to buy me a bike clearly knowing we couldn't afford it. Skipped lunch for full 4 years coz no money to afford it, lost insane amount of weight, made fun of coz I wire same jeans washed out of color for 2 years.\n\n\nStill remember when I got 6L offer 5 years ago, such a good feeling, partied away trying to live what I missed in college years,, party time lasted for 3+ yeas till I got my bearings.\n\n\nSo it's great you have made it & in clouds, but do remember not to overdo it like me, enjoy nicer things in life & live easy."
'good for you OP , i started off at rs.5000 pm and had a lovely set of rich friends who used to take me out drinking and never asked for me to pay :) .. for years they took me out and now i know they are proud when i take the fkers out '
'This is a very personal accomplishment, it seems weird to me if you want to celebrate/share it with some online strangers.\nTo each his own, congrats anyway.'
'Congratulations again.'
'Congrats and dont forget to put your savings in an SIP. Earning is one thing, but investing wisely will help to almost double your savings in a very short time. '

"15 years is a long time for av friendship to last but unfortunately that doesn't mean it will last forever. Remember, some people are friends for a reason and some people are friends for a season. Just think of it as that season has passed. He was a good friend for where you were at that time in life but now you both need different things. And that's ok."
'Congrats buddy. You seem like a great employee to have. I was thinking of referring you in my company but your work is not related. Nevertheless, good to hear your story.\nStart looking out for more jobs. Switch and you can easily get 30% more.'
'Such a heartwarming accomplishment, congratulations man'
'A bit of advice- learn how to guess git and start contributing to open source projects in your free time .\nWhen going for a job interview show them your contributions and you will be in a different league of your own\n. Some people also get jobs at fortune 500 companies , who approach them after seeing their work '

'Congratulations Buddy. Cheers!'
'Congratulations. Enjoy and grow. The small things in life make a big difference, so try to enjoy the journey as well as the destination.\n\nKudos, you have done well OP.'
'You have a rare quality: acceptance. Hope I could be more like in the years to come (be more accepting of things in career and life). Cheers and congrats!'
'Humble bragger!!!. But good job dude you deserve it . All the best for your future now head over to /r/indiainvestments and invest your extra money carefully . Do spend some money on things you love to do. Only then you will know the real value of having a job and earning good money. Good night and good luck.'
"Congrats.Plan your finances.Save up and invest.You won't regret it.I started a SIP when I started working (a very small amount) and now it is a good financial backup."
'Good to hear that. You have no idea how many are there like us.'
'Congrats, you are doing much better than me as of now. I got the highest package in campus when I was 23 just 7 months ago. 7 lpa, then 8, then 10 for 3 years with no bond, of course. Sadly, I had an unfortunate accident that left my hand very vulnerable. Parents paying for surgeries and stuff. Hopefully, will get better by May and will get another job of similar or better package. Cheers!'
"Congratulations, OP! More success and power to you!\n\nKeep at it, you'll get there!\n\nEdit: FWIW, i started with a pay of 11k. I've only gone up from there :)"
'Thanks for this post.\nReally happy for you.\nCongratulations buddy. 👍'
'Thanks OP. Your optimism has influenced me in a good way.'
"Cheers mate :) \n\nHere's to many more L(s)PA :D"
'Thanks, this post really helps put things in perspective. Wish you more success, financial and otherwise, in the future. '
"Great job there buddy. \nYou're going to scale them heights. Keep at it !"
"I too have earned some money. What surprised me the most is that I didn't feel anything, literally nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\nMaybe it's true that money can't buy happiness. I haven't even spent a single rupee I have earned.\n\nJust wanna say that OP, you're doing great, just don't get lost in chasing money, cause money isn't everything.\n\nGod! I need to stop preaching and see a therapist."
'Hey ! Congratulations, now that you start to spend and save, remember that spending is the key to earn more contrary to usual thinking. Never be content, increase your hunger to achieve more.\n'
'Nice dude. Congrats. '
"More power to you my man. It's good to remember the past to feel grateful about your present. Healthy trait. Don't lose it."
"Bit too late, but congrats. Keep at it. Money isn't everything. However, if you are good enough, money will follow you. :)"
'**Holy Shit!!** This is like 90% exactly my story:\n\nEven I got a 6.5 Lpa job just last month\n\n> I started off with an 8k salary \n\n*- same here*\n\n\n> I stay at home with folks \n\n*- same here*\n\n\n> And I studied in a really mediocre college  \n\n*- ditto (I think my college was even shittier than yours)*\n\n\n> So many of my friends earn around 1 lakh a month \n\njust a small difference here; 2 of my friends make more than 1 Lpm and the 3rd one makes approx. 4-5 times that amount working abroad (we were a group of 4 in college)\n\n> I was also very depressed three years ago\n\n me too, coz I\'d always compare my salary against theirs. But I\'ve since then learned this life lesson of never to compare salaries, or better never ask for one\'s salary ever, coz there\'s rearely any positive outcome for us in knowing other\'s salary imo. So better be happy with what you have and try to expand your knowledge, a better package will automatically follow that.\n\nCheers!!\n\nPS: now that we have this kind of package, a new kind of headache pops-up called "Tax Savings", and I don\'t understand shit about taxes/finance.'
"Congrats mate. Don't forget to pay the taxes."
'Well done OP! I too started out similarly at 7,500 and I remember the struggle. Had to be supported financially by my mom.. so glad those days are long gone! You will come out stronger through this! Great job!'
'Watch what it does to your taxes. Friendly reminder. '
"> I've lost a close friend because he couldn't understand that I didn't have enough money to go out and drink every weekend just a year ago, when I was making 25k a month\n\nHe was never a friend to begin with."
'such a heartfelt post.. congratulations OP! Stay happy :)'
"Congrats man! What do you do now? I'm from a core branch & infamous university. already in a neck deep water & haven't been able to get a  job yet, thinking of becoming a programmer but don't know about the future. "
'Congrats mate. I am happy for you. '
'Congratulations man.'
'Congratulations !!!'

"A mechanical undergraduate here. It is really comforting to know that mechanical engineers can cross this limit. Kudos to you, sir.\nHow long has it taken you to reach that level? \nWhat do you think of the mechanical sector of the industry in the country? Will it ever come out of the recession? In my city, most of the companies have shut down due to recession and therefore, no one's hiring. I have been searching for a job for atleast 1.5 years and haven't been able to land a job that pays well. "
'How old are you?\n\nAnd congrats mate. '
'I love you OP\n'
"Thanks man. Yeah, I keep where I come from in my mind all the time. I slept in a cold bus stand in the middle of the night on a weekly basis so that I could work in shifts and save money. I'm never forgetting that. "
'Halfway to mediocrity. Hurray'
"Thank you. I have cousins who are struggling with their jobs as well, so that keeps me grounded. I took a month off recently to breathe in the fresh air. Came back and found out about this. \n\nSome people make it seem so easy, but it's difficult having and sustaining a career, let alone getting decently paid for it. \n\nMan, I had to choose between buying clothes or buying books, so I stuck with books. I was made fun of for my clothes, and for being absent for all social outings (because I couldn't afford it), but I am happier off for it. I can finally buy both clothes and books for festivals, it's relieving now that I can buy good shoes too. I bought two pairs of shoes last month, and I felt so liberated!"
"Haha. Well, he used to pay for a lot too, but he used to advertise that he paid. He would say demeaning things and tell me that I don't have a life. I can barely name one or two positive things about that friendship. "
"Thank you very much. I try not to think too much of what others are being paid really. I don't ever want to be faced with a situation where I cannot pay for hospital bills and the like ever again. That's mostly what my goal is. Personally, the only thing I need money for are books. When I was a kid, I decided I wanted to earn enough to spend 3000 a month on books, enough money to buy one book a day. I used to read books in the shop because I couldn't afford them back then. "
"You echo all my thoughts! I really think am I really worthy for this and all? But you know what in today's world nobody can justify anybody's salary and companies give money when they see something out of you they can use. Sometime it's luck but smart work always pays, risk taking ability pays and so on. Still the thoughts are there! I know many of my friends extremely intelligent but not ready to take even a calculative risk of joining a startup or some better product company out of their domain are left behind! "

'XD some day! '
'How do you get that kind of money? Management like right?'
"Oh, I mostly did this to remind myself how lucky I am. I told a few friends but they all tell me to get a new job, because I'm still underpaid. XD\n\nSo I thought I'd just post here like a random dear diary post. "

"I hate religion with a passion but gotta say India do make religion look cool. Hindus are pretty innovative when they celebrate, apart from pollution. Even Indian Muslims are cool and liberal in compare to Arab, when it comes to their festival, I remember back in 2012 I was in Qatar during Eid and everyone was very Muslim, i mean they were going by the book even when it comes to greet. Here in Bangalore, my Muslim friends greet each other normally they smoke and eat biryani, they have completely different way to celebrate eid. \n\nIf only Muslims weren't dicks and Hindus weren't super dicks, India would have been a better place."

"Plus only 10% of Indians have cars. EVs account for around 1% of all new car sales in the US in 2016, with all their wealth and 1st world infrastructure. Yes, we can always point to edge case countries like Norway but they don't count. Show me 50+ million countries with more than a few percentage points in new car sales being EVs.\n\nIt will take probably 5-7 years before India has a decent EV offering and then you have to add 20 years to change the entire fleet *IF* 100% of all new car sales in India by 2025 are EVs, which is unlikely. That means that as more Indians buy cars and urbanisation keeps up, the time up to 2030 will likely see increasing pollution on the transportation side.\n\nThe silver lining is the rapid build-out of renewable energy. Electricity demand is also falling, due to stressed assets in the industrial sector and lack of demand, which means that the coal build-out will be far less than initially feared.\n\nNet-net, it's hard to say just how much pollution will increase, but it's fair to say that it will likely get worse before it gets better. And how fast it gets better is also a question. India will have 1.75 billion people in an area far smaller than China. Plus you'll have Bangladesh and Pakistan spewing their pollution into North-Western and North-Eastern India as well and they are also stacked with people."

'As someone who has been living in Jodhpur for the past 10 years now, I can assure you that it is not a one off incident. The trust that runs the fort turns a blind eye to it and it is nothing short of putting a poster saying "Indians and Dogs not allowed". Their sole aim is to provide exclusive experience to visitor paying the elevated entry fee and since they cannot have differential pricing for food, this is how they discourage us, even those that can are rich or hungry enough to shell out 350 for a club sandwich. You will see the same double-standard at many places across the city. Restaurants like On-The-Rocks denying to serve alcohol to male-only parties in the garden area, while same rule does not apply to the foreigners is another one that I have experienced.  \n\nThis is the reason why I have practically stopped going to the tourist sites and instead try and discover lesser frequented places that have nice experiences to offer even if they lack on the grandeur of Mehrangarh fort.  \n\nBut this does not stop me from being nostalgic about the time when I could push up my bicycle right upto the fort from \'Chand pole\'- the gate in the city on hot summer afternoons, get into the visitors\' area just to sit for hours in Janani Dyodhi where regal Sher Singhji (now no more) used to play flute (the current flute player is a pale shadow of him both in terms of playing as well as mannerisms). During the monsoons when there is a very large crowd of pilgrims (local folk) passing through Jodhpur on the way to Ramdevra (near Pokran), I have seen the fort and the palace be very lenient in charging entry fee. I\'d not be surprised if they are charged strictly now.  \n\nAnyway, I\'d suggest that you don\'t feel too bad about it. It is a very very small part of the experience of Rajasthan (even though I have felt similarly at Udaipur and Jaisalmer). If you have the time and the inclination, I\'d suggest you take some time to explore off the tourist circuit. If you are still here, I\'d suggest you try eating at Gypsy (unlimited thali), Skyz (awesome view of the Palace from the terrace area) or, if you are still craving for the club sandwich, at 15 AD in Sardarpura.  \n\nHeck, I could join you if you want! :)'

Probably about 2/3rds of the "ink" on the page is concentrated at the top. \n\nConsider the Norwegian design, where the elements at three corners are balanced by an offset right centered element. Since it is significantly larger, the colour is much fainter, and the composition balances out. With the NZ design, the large silver fern is balanced by centralizing all the other elements and displacing them to the left.\n\nIn your case, perhaps a smaller chakra would help balance things out? Another possibility is shifting the Ashoka capital lower down, closer to the text. This way if we were to draw a diagonal from the top left to the bottom right, the ink should be about equally distributed.\n\nMy two paise.'

"Thanks! Agree with you on the design aspect. With a nice design, it would really attract some attention. I'm usually jelly of other people having better designed passports at airports.\n\nThis design was mostly influenced by the new Norwegian design, as I mentioned in another comment. The quarter chakra is a bit like the fern leaves on the edges yes. But hell yeah, the Swiss one is dope too. They benefit from having only four languages to put on their passport. Imagine if we had to put all ours (don't mistake me, I'm not a fan of Hindi imposition, I'm originally from Tamil Nadu)."
"Thanks!\nYeah blue looks okayish at best. Works well on the Canadian passport I think. We have burgundy red passports here in the EU. They're quite nice too. Not sure how black would look, might need to make the emblem bigger to compensate for the dark colour. Works well for New Zealand. :)"

'Sasikala: Time to admit OPS to apollo.'
'I am happy OPS finally spoke up. He seems like a nice guy. Definitely a better option to Sasikala. Interesting to see how things turns out from here. Will AIADMK split up? Fresh elections?'
"I'm awestruck. Sasikala doesn't have the gravitas or charm or willpower that Jayalalitha had however much she believes she is. But this is an unprecedented move. It's going to be a really interesting few days. "
"This is arguably going to be the smartest political move of 2017. Before going into the reasons of why I think it is, I wish to reaffirm that AIADMK's strength lies in Jayalalithaa's immense public support. This move by OPS revisits that point time and time again. \n\nBy meditating at Amma's memorial and seemingly asking for advice, OPS has proven his loyalty to Amma even in her death. Sasikala, on the other hand seemed more intent on gaining the coveted CM post. This creates contrasting opinions in the minds of the public about where the real interests of these two candidates lie. \n\nThe final moments before any big decision is taken is the time when people tend to start second guessing their choices. And just before Sasikala's ascension, when suspicion is high, OPS has given people the right impetus to start doubting Sasikala's capability. Had this move been made anytime in the past, it would've lacked the impact it is having now because people would've lost interest when the time actually came. But it's high time now and this move by OPS might cause people to change sides.\n\nSasikala sought to **buy** the loyalties of the MLAs, OPS in one single stroke sought to **earn** the sympathies of crores of people which I believe he will be successful in. Coincidentally, this is also a cue to the BJP which will now defer the Governor's decision for a while until the Honorable Court pronounces its verdict. \n\nAlso, a split in the same caste might just be the spark that pushes other communities to switch sides too. There is plenty of evidence that is being circulated to show how OPS was actually sidelined and his speech tonight confirms that. A masterstroke to gain the support of the people. This also shows how he values people's opinions more than MLA support. Sheer brilliance!\n\nEDIT: I honestly can't marvel enough at this move. By playing the victim card, he has essentially won half of the game. By highlighting events of his authority being subverted, he has succeeded in making the anti-Sasikala people more anti, and has sowed the seed of doubt in the minds of those who support her. By keeping everything peaceful, he has again won the public support. Nobody likes a person who behaves rashly and unjustly. But his move is completely warranted and people understand this. By making this move, he has shifted the onus on every other entity involved in this political battle. Their moves are extremely limited too. This is the time for Opposition parties to rally against Sasikala. Sasikala and her core group can't make a mistake as any rash step they take will deepen support for OPS. \n\nMore importantly, by saying that he leaves it in the public domain, he has shown that he cares deeply about public opinion while Sasikala has only been about MLA and their support and the support of ministers. This portrays him as a person who's down to earth while Sasikala has been constantly been dealing with the VIPs and is part of the elites. People can see the difference instantly. "
'Tamilians can shed more light.\n\nIs Sasikala being supported? \nPersonally I do not like her. Reason being that only positive thing she has is that she is famous ex-friend of Jayalalitha. '

How does one believe him if he was following Amma\'s footsteps.He was also backing every Modi\'s policies which Amma certainly wouldn\'t have allowed it like she did before.\n\nAnd opposition including Enemies and BJP are now backing Panneer to revolt.Really, the out of the blue sympathy.haha.\n\nAnd those who think Sasikala isn\'t Amma, but yet she was hand in gloves with Amma for 30 years and doing all the works for Amma\'s policies to the people of TN.She ain\'t just a Maid or an Au Pair.Both lived together, and shared every aspect of life together.She is very much Chinnamma to the people who benefited by both of them.She is very much the deserving to be the next Amma.Thats how those freeloaders would think and see.And the word \'Amma\' does a lot with emotions if that is how the voters there see.\n\nJust my 2 cents.Feel free to contradict me.'

"**Name**: Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi: Unanswered Questions and Unasked Queries\n\n**Author**: Subramanian Swamy\n\n**Avg Rating**: 4.14 by 43 users\n\n**Description**: There are many good reasons why there should be a new book on Rajiv\nGandhi's assassination. Dr. Subramanian Swamy explains in the preface\nsome of these reasons. Even after the Supreme Court verdict on sentences\non the persons accused of killing Rajiv Gandhi there remains an area\nwhich the judiciary understandably has left untouched. It is the\npolitical accountability of a host of parties and individuals which\nneeds to be probed Dr. Swamy is only urging this.\\\n\\\nApart from being a live-wire politician, Dr. Swamy has been in a unique\nposition to have an insight into Indian politics. It is thus that this\nbook reveals his proximity to both Chandrashekhar, who became Prime\nMinister after the BJP-supported V.P. Singh Government fell, and to\nRajiv Gandhi whose Congress propped up the new government. He was thus\nprivy to many secrets between Chandrashekhar and Rajiv, apart from the\nbenefit as a Cabinet Minister he derived talking to deep throats.\\\n\\\nThe claim of this book is not to reveal who killed Rajiv. The author is\nhappy with the Supreme Court upholding the prosecution case stewarded by\nthe Special Investigation Team. The question he raises is that perhaps\nall those who should have been punished have not been in the dock. And,\nmost of them are not an offshore entity like the LTTE. If they are\nIndian political groups or individuals, including some belonging to\nRajiv's own Congress party, it would remain a moot question whether\nretribution has been done by only convicting the LTTE activists.\n\n\n Pages: None, Year: None\n\n---\n\n^(Bleep, Blop, Bleep!

"American public schools and colleges in large cities have a phenomenal amount of sport activities. But that's besides the point.\n\nMy comment doesn't ask for government funding for a sport.

Otherwise there will never be any change in India's performance in other events on the world stage."
">If a sport is popular then it will fund itself.\n\nBy your logic Kabaddi would have never been as popular as it is now, after Pro Kabaddi League. If efforts are not made to popularise something, then it never will be popular.\n\nAnd have you ever seen what facilities other sports in India have? \nShould non-cricketers just stop playing as their sport isn't funded well?\n\nAnd if there is no investment in other sports then even the ones who are great in that sport, won't see it as a good career so they'll have to abandon their dream.\n\n>Provide a big playground for children to play on in schools and stop investing in Sports.\n\nBelieve  me, sports and sportsperson require much more than playground. I am not sure how this will help the people who when do want to go into that sport, can't because of lack of coaches, equipment etc.\n\n>Do people in the US want their government to invest in Cricket?\n\nWhy does it matter even if they do or don't? What matters is that there are plenty of sports there that aren't as popular as American Football, Baseball and Basketball, but that doesn't stop them from providing at least good facilities for other sports.\n\n>I like NBA but I don't want the government to invest money into it.\n\nWrong again. NBA isn't a sport, basketball is, which in India *is* getting popular, but still does not have that significant improvement in facilities for it."
"Lol. Going to the moon isn't pointless and going to the everest isn't either. First understand my point. Going to moon was about knowledge and tehnology and the advancement of our species and making its way to space, finding life etc. Now we know what there is to know about the moon and we go elsewhere. But if you go to the moon tomorrow.. It doesnt mean anything and need not be news unless you are the first Indian to do that. Same thing with this everest thing. We know more about our planet geologically because someone actually did it. But it's pointless to do it now. Perhaps its important to the individual and that's fine but its not newsworthy and certainly not worth discussing. Hell 3 weeks ago I was working with a guy who just came back from doing the everest treck. "
">I urge everyone to read this. Even if you're not into sports.\n\nCurious as to why would you recommend the article especially as a reply to /u/FairyEnchantedDildo's post?\n\nabout the article: \n\n* Top two countries in the ranking, Kenya and Ethiopia has all their medals in athletics (especially endurance athletics, only one medal is in a non-running event). A certain section of their population has huge genetic advantage in endurance activities - hence the result.\n\n* North-Korea: participants have a life-death incentive (sometimes literally) to do well. Government cares a lot about their image in such events.\n\n* Uzbekistan and Ukraine are formal USSR countries. Their perspective towards Olympics type events are somewhat similar to that of NorthKorea now. It was a _Useful_ method of promoting communist ideals. Plus they still have facilities and intellectual property left from that era. \n\n* Rest of the developing countries have less than 4 medals, not worth exploring.\n\nSo, what was the point of the article, again?\n\n"
"And why do we need to do well in any Sports? I am not saying Sports are bad.

'Well totally agreed that it\'s not newsworthy, but in your comment you said "what\'s the point of doing this", I guess I was replying to that comment. '
'From the same article:\n\n>The clear **outliers** are Ethiopia and North Korea. Both are classified as low income countries and rank second and third, respectively, in medal efficiency. North Korea is one of the most closed economies in the world and its citizens are chronically malnourished. But it produced Olympic medals at a more efficient clip than both the U.S. and U.K.\n\nBoth your examples are acknowledged in the article itself\n\nTo answer your question:\n\n>Of course, this should all be taken with a heap of salt. This exercise is not to suggest that those countries are applying their economic productivity to the achievement of Olympic medals. **Ranking a country by its efficiency in winning medals is probably more of a thought exercise than an indicator of achievement or development. But this does offer a glimpse into how some developing countries are making the most of limited resources compared to richer ones on the field of play.**'
"Maybe it doesn't matter how we perform on the world stage. But active people are healthier. That's why we need sport.\n\nAnd we need to expose people to other games because choices are great. Not everyone is cut out for cricket. Or they could use some variety in their lives.  Or they don't have the infrastructure for cricket. Or they plain don't like the sport.\n\nSeeing role models encourages them to participate in something new."
'My point was not that they are _outliers_ but why they are so and why it would not make sense for others to emulate them. Thus, the inability to understand as to why you would put that argument forward.\n\n> But this does offer a glimpse into how some developing countries are making the most of limited resources compared to richer ones on the field of play.\n\nBut that thought exercise is at best a brainfart... all the competent countries in that list is there either due to genetic advantage of their citizens or they hail from a community that at one time used to put glory over other things and probably winning it just out of past infrastructure and momentum.'
"I played Basketball without any role model for fun. All you need to play basketball is 2 hoops. \nWe are not investing in cricket and we shouldn't invest in other sports. I talked about swimming as a hobby. \n\nNot enough great movies are made in India because producers and financers are worried that the movie won't make enough money. Do you want government to invest in movie industry too so that we get better movies and better directors as role models for our youth?\n\nYou can go and play football without any government investment other than a playground which is what i suggested. We don't have the money to invest in state of the art indoor facilities for Sports. Cricket got popular and now facilities for Cricket have increased to world class levels even though government is not putting their own money into it. \n\nWhen government was the one putting money into cricket, the facilities were pretty shitty. I am asking you again. Why don't US colleges and schools put money into cricket? The answer is that it isn't popular and it isn't an Olympics sport. "
'people chose it just like American people chose Baseball and Football. NBA got popular on its own without any intervention from US government. \n\nInfrastructure for Soccer in US got better as its popularity increased. Soccer is gaining popularity in India anyways. \nYou know what is common between Soccer and Cricket? Both just need a playground. You need more money to play cricket. You buy a football and it will last you a longer time than a leather or tennis ball. \n\nGoing by your logic, Soccer should already be very popular as very little investment is needed for kids to play it. '
'I mentioned swimming to you and not someone from a poor family. I want playground in government schools so that anyone can play on them no matter poor or rich.  \n\nInvesting in some sports requires too much money for a country like India. Why do you think a lot of college Sports in US get cutbacks because of American Football which gets the most money pumped in ? And that is US which is and has been a first world country for before my grandad was even born. People in US pay ridiculous tuition Fees. \n\n\nThe truth is that investing in good facilities for small Olympics sports makes no sense for any 1st world country, let alone a 3rd world one like India. \n\nPeople want good facilities for niche sports and Olympics like competitions so that they don\'t feel bad when their child spends too much time playing that Sport. \n\nGovernment spending money on infrastructure for engineering, management and science results in a lot of money for the country. Investing in Sports results in very little money for the country other than "pride" which most of this sub hates so i have no idea why people here like Sports so much. \n\nBCCI is making money from Cricket, NBA and NFL make money from Basketball and Football in US while tax payers pay for the arenas those teams play in.

'I laughed too , though it is such an absurd comment. '
">our diplomats and foreign affairs personnel know better\n\nHope so. After all they are [discussing](http://www.northeasttoday.in/china-ready-to-cede-aksai-chin-for-tawang/) with China for a border settlement. India is ready to accept China's claim line in Aksai Chin. But China also wants Tawang in AP. India suggested that instead of Tawang, India will cede some land elsewhere in AP (or may be some other sector). China came back with a proposal that they will take Tawang and in return cede some more land to India in AP sector. That's where talks are stuck now because giving up Tawang is politically impossible."
">India made Tibet its business when we gave dalai lama refuge. >India is the land where Buddhism originated ( along with Nepal) . \n>Buddhism is not dead in India and I wish you would actually visit some of the north east regions where Buddhism is thriving.\n\nThose people that you are talking about in the north east regions of India aren't Indian in the traditional sense since they are closer genetically to your average nepali/bhutanese/tibetan.\n\nWhat /u/iVarun meant is that Buddhism is dead amongst the Indo-Aryans/Dravidian populace which form the majority of India and are also seen as the representatives of India today. \n\nPretty sure many of those North Easterners would like their own independent state like Nepal/Bhutan/Tibet if they could.\n\nHence, Most people in East Asia, South East Asia and other regions do not view India as having the same Buddhist leverage with other countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet which aren't seen to be the homeland of Buddhism instead of India today since the Monks and followers are all from Sino-Tibetan descent. \n\nThat's why you don't see the rest of Asia nor the World clamoring to invite Indo-Aryan/Dravidian gurus to talk about Spiritualism or the meaning of life etc etc in their countries since they are all Buddhists.\n\nInstead you see so many East Asians(Chinese/Japan/Korea) and South East Asians and other foreigners waiting to seek advice about Spiritualism and Buddhism to Sogyal Rinpoche/Kelsang Gyatso and other Sino-Tibetan Monks and other Buddhist teachers and so on."

">If we carry on making it our 'business', China may suddenly decide to make some militant group inside India its business.\n\nThat thing is already there.

They seem to think they can outrun us in the emerging superpower race by creating such distractions, if not by direct conflict. It is only natural for India to retaliate. \n\nIt is China's biggest strategic mistake to sponsor Pakistan in every matter against india, when India can prove a far better equal partner to them on the geopolitical stage. Chinese only talk of the 'Asian century dream', but they are ruining it by playing double standards with India on regional issues.\n\nEdit: taking back my words '... retaliate the same way'.

The average Chinese has a fairly accurate idea how backward India is, compared to their homeland. They can look at what democracy actually produced, and heave a sigh of relief that their country isn't one.\n\nIn fact, it's much deeper than that.

And lol if you think they aren't brainwashed. Just look at the chinese trolls brigading that worldnews post."
"I wish you posted this a bit earlier. I was discussing with another poster about the brainwashing that Indians are subjected to by GoI. Your post is perfect example of the result of that highly effective misinformation campaign.\n\nChina has the [highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_territories_by_land_borders) number of land borders in the World with a total count of 14, tied with Russia. 16, if you consider Hong Kong and Macau before their hand over. Within a span of 50 years China has settled all border disputes, reached agreement, ratified and demarcated its borders with [**12** of it 14 land neighbors](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mtExBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=neville+maxwell+sundering&source=bl&ots=bZA9YGP0Bh&sig=R5Xs_vtLFB7Y33xBTS5ZMwsxogI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjE_qL4qN_SAhUCTY8KHem4C6gQ6AEIQzAK#v=onepage&q&f=false) (page 24).\n\nIn almost all cases they [settled](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROC_Administrative_and_Claims.svg) for less than half of the disputed territory.\n\nIndia by contrast, took 40 years to [sort out](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/enclave-exchange-india-bangladesh-to-make-history-at-midnight/story-Kc3121DtODl8sIQyLTvbKK.html) its border with one neighbor, Bangladesh, which is in relatively good terms with India.\n\nWhich country do you think is more serious about settling disputes?\n\nAnd here's the kicker. India has no legitimate claim on either AP or Aksai Chin. It's India that is illegally occupying territory in AP. And back in the 1950s the Chinese were very likely ready to accept our claim over AP if we dropped demanding Aksai Chin. Instead we refused to talk, provoked them into a war, got our ass handed to us, then whined, screamed and cried for 40 years before finally getting back to the discussion table in the end. Of course, the Chinese are pissed and they have rescinded there earlier, quite generous offer. This time they want Tawang in addition to Aksai Chin. If India agrees, given China's track record, you will get agreement the next day. But it's politically impossible. So this issue will continue to fester. This is what you get for harebrained adventures."
"Allow me to offer a different point of view. \nIn a nation as divided (linguistically, culturally, ancestrally) as ours and equally adamant, it was obvious that we'd not unite under a new language. So it was obvious that the language we all were made to learn would continue to unite us.\n\nI mean, I would not be able to communicate with half of you were it not for our mutual English skills. Let us respect how we made English our own and united despite the instigations of divisive politics"

'Well no shit India outranks France, China, and Spain. India was a colony of the British Empire for how long? As apposed to these nations that were not only ever part of this Empire, so therefore have no real reason to fund mass amounts of English language courses other than for international relations, but have their own colonial regions to focus spreading their native language proficiency too? Obviously most countries support English classes as it\'s a disgustingly popular language.  Here\'s a better title "TIL Foreign nations host my language."'
"We should be careful drawing any inferences from this list. This index is not a sample of the national population, it's a self-selecting sample of a *test population* which is, in India's case, far above average in socio-economic status. \n\nIIRC, less than 10% of India is fluent in English. I don't know what the number is for, say, Spain, but I'd be willing to bet that it's a higher number.  It's just that the average Spanish person doesn't have the same need to take these tests because he/she already lives in a wealthy country. If they want to move somewhere, they can usually find well-paying jobs in Latin America where there is a premium for a fluent Spanish-speaking *gringo*. \n\nOr they can move to Germany, Netherlands or the Nordics, which many do(the UK is less prominent for Iberians for some reason than for Eastern Europeans).\n"

'I am actually surprised it is not higher. '
'> Higher than France, China and Spain.\n\nFrench,Spanish are international languages also. Mandarin has more speakers than English and China can run the country based on one language alone. So a comparison with India for English proficiency is irrelevant. India needs to work more in improving its literacy rate in Indian languages. '

"What's so great about it ? We learn English only because it helps us professionally."
"Yeah. I still don't get why there is so much hate for English and English speaking people in our country. I see language as medium of communication (which it literally is!) and English does a really good job of that (specially in our diverse country). It's globally accepted and its also easy to learn. "
"India is more like the European Union than one of the EU's member states. \n\nWhile Germans use German in Germany and French use French in France, what do you think happens when the Eurozone, which doesn't even include the UK, meets? Most of the time the discussion -- not by diktat -- occurs in English because it is an effective link language.\n\nI'd like to see India move towards the EU model where, officially, all languages are on an equal footing, but when people from different communities get together, the link language is English or whatever else happens to work. \n\nNo more Hindi imposition, thanks. "
"> Duh! They have a national language which they speak. Most of them see no need to learn a foreign language like us.\n\nThey actually need to learn English as well - the lack of English skills is actually impacting them by stunting their economic growth so it isn't as though it is a 'neat skill to have' but a core competency especially with globalisation playing a greater role in growing ones economy. Mind you there is one saving grace and that is the lack of willingness by China to get their English proficiency sorted out because god know it would be a shitshow for all concerned if China got its proficiency near that of Singapore - low cost labour and high English proficiency with every call centre wanting to open up shop. It appears that nationalistic circling jerking is taking over China:\n\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/02/china-boosts-chinese-usage-slips-in-global-english-proficiency-ranking.html\n\nClue to China: No one is going to learn your needlessly complex convoluted language if one can avoid it and when there is a country sitting next doing (India) going hell for leather at improving its short comings then eventually many businesses will simply move their manufacturing hub along with higher value jobs elsewhere."

I grew up speaking English, my immediate family communicate with me with significant amounts of English. English is not a "foreign", "British" or "American" language to me - it is my language, absolutely native to me in India. I don\'t expect literally anyone in continental Europe to have the same level of English comprehension and native intuition that I do, and that holds true, really - I have never met a European who is as comfortable producing native English as I am.'
">Why can't we do the same?\n\nWhy should that be the goal in the first place? Language is nothing more than a means to communicate your ideas to the fellow humans. Using English eliminates the need for unnecessary translations.\n\nAlso, while you embark on your journey to make Hindi great again, make sure you've something like Stack Exchange in Hindi. And also YouTube channels like CGPGrey, Veritasium, VSauce, CrashCourse etc. by Hindi content creators. And documentaries like Planet Earth II, Cosmos: A Space Time Odessey, Triumph of the Nerds etc. in Hindi."

"So the entire reason this encounter happened is because of a few likely reasons : \n\n* Territorial. The tusker seems like a young lone male, and the rhino might have intruded upon the tusker's area of beat. \n\n* The elephant is in *musth*. It's a male(tusker) as you can see. Male elephants go through a period of high testosterone levels and reproductive hormones called *musth* (basically they sort of turn into the average Randian :P ). They also become highly aggressive during this phase, and some even end up becoming rogue elephants.  \n\nNow, who would win? \n\nAssuming the tusker is in musth, he would, hands down. His mind is too crazed to assess the situation normally. Even the slightest provocation would make him go nuts. But if it led to a fight, the rhino also has an advantage in being shorter than the elephant. That means he can charge the tusker with that horn at the underbelly. \n\nSource : am into wildlife and wildlife photography. I'm not an expert,though, so if any of you could tell me I'm right that'd be great. "

"> Elephant hide is just a thick. You need high calibre guns to even penetrate an elephant's skin\n\nThat is misinformation.\n\nDespite its thickness, an elephant’s skin is very sensitive, to the point where it can feel a fly land on its back.

"Due to the specific arrangement of a cow's respiratory system, the cow needs to inhale oxygen. O2 works as a catalyst to break down CO2. The carbon is stored in a stomach chamber and mixed with the grass to aid digestion - btw this is why dung is a great source of fuel. The oxygen is released. The cow can also break down more dangerous gases like NO2 and SO2 through a similar process. H2S can also be converted to oxygen, but the byproduct there is CH4, which is better than H2S. I have more citations and research which are part of my thesis of PhD in bakchodi, i'll be happy to provide more if needed.\n\nHence proved."

"
"Thanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.\n\n**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)\n\nIt's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief."
"I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.\n\nFor example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not."

"Your assessment is on point. While reading about Karamveer I can't help but admire him. He always just wanted to make Yoga popular among the masses. But at the end of the day he considered himself as an Arya Samaj member. In fact, in the post I left out to mention that when Shankar Dev offered the ashram to Karamveer he repeatedly rejected it. It was on insistence from Ramdev and Balakrishna that he went ahead with it.\n\nAlso back in 2011 when Ramdev falls out with Congress, Digvijay Singh brings up Ramdev's transgressions with Shankar Dev and Karamveer. With Shankar Dev missing/dead, the only way for Ramdev to save face in the crowd was to show Karamveer in the stage with him. So he started hounding the man with phone calls and messages. \n\nFinally he and his men showed up to Karamveer's small yoga camp. Probably to get it over with Karamveer agreed to share stage with Ramdev. And that is the problem. Karamveer and Shankar Dev have high standards and believe in the ability to forgive and forget. A bullish man like Ramdev sees this as a weakness and exploits it to his advantage. "
'Yeah and when you try to search for porn you get an automated pop up of Hanuman Chalisa running on loop.'
"Yes. There is about 20 pages of Glossary section in the book with people interviewed for each chapter, links of incidents she refers to, Baba's own comments (YouTube posts) etc. I found it quite thorough to be honest. "
"When poor or middle-class people think of wealth they think of all the comforts and joys it would bring them, but after a certain point these physical joys are maxed out so it seems pointless for them to consider earning more money beyond that point especially if they don't have children to inherit their wealth.\n\nBut this is not the case with the super-rich and power hungry people. They know that the real worth of wealth is the power it brings, and power does not max out so they can keep going irrespective of how much wealth they have already made. Power is an endgame in itself and the joy it brings is on a completely different level from the joy of luxuries and comforts."

"For the Mumbai residents or the citizens who are raging about now everywhere, why you did not go out to vote for your Municipal elections? The voter turnout for the local municipal elections in Mumbai [was a meager 55%](http://www.rediff.com/news/report/pix-civic-body-polls-mumbai-votes/20170221.htm) and that too was the highest in the last 25 years.\n\nThere is no doubt that the politicians who are in power should be questioned and mocked. But remember this, WE the citizens of this country have an equal responsibility as well. Besides voting, how many of us know our MP, MLA or Corporator? How many of us spend couple of hours every month - in our local associations or with our local representative to get things fixed? Yes the excuse that we don't have time or resources to follow up but let me tell you, its not difficult.\n\nThe problem is we like to enrage on social media these days but on the side ignoring our duties as well. I will repeat, I'm not against mocking or criticizing our politicians, whoever be it. But somehow we get our comforts by mocking and memeing our situations because we think we're entitled to services, as we paid taxes. We end up normalizing it, by doing this.\n\nBut remember this - our silence and our inability to perform our duties as a citizen, has time and again allowed politicians like these reign in power. If you think you're incapable to perform your duties, remember this - WE are the cream of the Indian internet. You shouldn't expect the remaining crowd to perform their duties too, wherein we dream of emigrating from this country.\n\nToday it is Shiv Sena, tommorrow BJP, after that Congress and again some other coalition. The truth is we're comfortable with them and have normalized their ineptness and our laziness as a citizen. In the process, we look for small freebies or appeal to our minority communities.\n\nNext time you go out to vote - Please do some research and vote for the BEST CANDIDATE in your region and NOT YOUR FAVOURITE POLITICAL PARTY. And keep asking them questions for the remaining five years.\n\nIf you don't vote, please don't complain and cry for the next five years. As a citizen you had a duty to vote and make your candidate accountable, which we regularly fail to do."

The problem is that our technology institutions only care about theory and appreciate the toppers.\n\nOne of my friend is a very good graphic designer and one of my friend is a very good coder but since they don't score more than 7 cgpa, teachers never appreciate them. Whereas we have toppers who gets 9+ cgpa who don't know anything apart from bookish things but still they get preference everywhere.\n\nLast year there was a big national level hackathon, we all wanted to join but college was asked to make teams, teachers did not take us, they selected the toppers and they did not even get selected whereas we ( me and few of my friends ) took part in a online hackathon and won it. \n\nWell that's the current situation of education system and mentality of most of the people . \n\nSo this kind of people don't surprise me anymore. May be because of these reasons we see surveys like 90% CSE in India  grads can't code .\n\nSad"

'Why is a graphic designer doing engineering when he can do Applied Arts from Mumbai or something similar at NID?

Same shit happened to me in Applied Arts, my professors used to purposely "reject" my ad campaigns for display because I never kissed their ass.

"I can feel your frustration. I was in the same boat but look, there's loads of opportunity now. You have to understand that many teachers get their degrees the same way; read, memorize, write, get high grades. I've been reprimanded for wrong answers many a time. I go back home and check to find that I was right. It happens. The really good teachers are concerned about their research. They have no obligation to give students opportunities outside of coursework. But, the environment is such that there's so much you can do on your own. Form teams with your friends. Participate in hackathons. Build a good product and pitch it to someone. There's so much you can do. Don't look for their appreciation or an opportunity from them. If you like to code, practise, learn and participate in contests. If you liked design, do some pro Bono work for people and build up your portfolio. Don't feel dejected by the state of education here. There's always a place for hard work and dedication. "

You can amend it and say\nwhere to play national anthem and where it can\'t be done. Nowadays, the anthem\nis played during matches, tournaments and even Olympics where half of the\ncrowd does not understand its meaning," said Justice DY Chandrachud.\n\nThe bench said: "You (Centre) take a call. Government should not show any\nreservation to the amendment as the court would not allow it to shoot from its\nshoulders".\n\nThe government argued that India is a diverse country and the national anthem\ncan be a unifying force. "By reasons of vast diversity based on religion,\ncaste and region, it becomes necessary to have a unifying force which can be\nbrought about by playing the national anthem in theatres. So when people come\nout of the theatre, they are all Indians," said Attorney General KK Venugopal.\n\nThe court indicated that it may modify its own order of December 1, 2016, by\nreplacing the word "shall" with "may".\n\nLast year, reacting to a petition by one Shyam Narayan Chouksey, the Supreme\nCourt had said playing the anthem before every show would "instill committed\npatriotism and nationalism" and "reflect love and respect for the motherland".\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

Here is an US centric article, but it works similarly in India:\n\n> That means, if you showed up to watch Bridget Jones’ Diary on opening night, then of the $12 you put out for a ticket, the movie theatre only got to keep between $2.40 and $3.00 of it. (film studios take the rest) \n\n> as you move into the second and third weeks of release, the percentage starts to swing to anywhere from 45% – 55% that the theatre gets to keep. It gets better after the fourth week when theatres generally can keep up to 80% or better of the ticket sales.\n\n> There is an obvious inherent problem with this arrangement. I don’t know about you, but when I finally get around to seeing a film that’s already been in the theatres for 4 or 5 weeks, I’m usually one of the only people in the place. It doesn’t do the establishment a lot of good to keep 80% of the ticket sales when only 14 tickets are sold per show.\n\n> Movie theaters are then forced to really make their money off concessions. One theater manager said “We’re not in the movie business… we’re in the candy business”. Very true. So if you ever wondered why a $0.15 bag of popcorn is costing you $5, and a $0.08 cup of Coke is running you another $4… it’s because the economics of the industry system is so screwed up that the concession stand is where theaters have to make most of their money.\n\n> http://www.themovieblog.com/2007/10/economics-of-the-movie-theater-where-the-money-goes-and-why-it-costs-us-so-much/\n\nA lot more detail* in the article.

'[If you interested, here is an extract from a judgment on his issue back in 2003 authored by Dipak Misra when he was at the MP HC.] (https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1836522/)\n\n>National Anthem is to be sung with magna cum laude and nobody can ostracize the concept of summa cum laude. In the case at hand, as we have noted earlier the son of the protagonists sings the National Anthem as a surprise item. The presentation, according to us, is in medias res. The child actor forgets the line and utters the term "sorry". To some it may appear lapsus linguae, slip of the tongue or a natural forgetting but if the whole thing is perceived, understood and appreciated in complete scenario, it is the script writer\'s fertile imagination and the Director\'s id est. It is deliberate. A deliberate slip of the pen. It is because there is in a way, deliberation to project a dramatic effort to show that the scene depicted in the film is on an absolute terra firma. The writer and director have totally forgotten that they were portraying the National Anthem of a great country.\n\n>In \'Shashtras\' this great country has been described as under :\n\n>"ASMAD DESHA PRASUTASYA SAKASADAGRA JANMAMAH SWAM SWAM CHARITRAM SCHIKSERAN PRITHIVYAM SARVA MANAVAN."\n\n>Not for nothing, in one of the ancient epics of India it has been so said :\n\n>"API SWARNAMAYI LANKA NA ME ROCHATE LAKSHMAN JANANI JANMA-BHUMISCHA SWARGADAPI GARIYASI."\n\n>They have not kept in mind \'vox populi, vox dei\'. The producer and the director have allowed the National Anthem of Bharat, the alpha and omega of the country to the backseat.\n\n>On a first flush it may look like a magnum opus of patriotism but on a deeper probe and greater scrutiny it is a simulacrum having the semblance but sans real substance. There cannot be like Caesar\'s thrasonical brags of "veni, vidi, vici." The boy cannot be allowed to make his innocence a parents rodomontrade, at the cost of national honour. In our view it is contrary to national ethos and an anthema to the sanguinity of the national feeling. It is an exposition of ad libitum.\n\n>The national anthem is pivotal and centripodal to the basic conception of sovereignty and integrity of India. It is the marrow of nationalism, hypostasis of patriotism, nucleus of national heritage, substratum of culture and epitome of national honour. '
'This I agree with. Still not a good reason for piracy mate so with all respect get bent. :) '
"I run Netflix and Amazon Prime. Neither are censored in the slightest. I don't think HotStar is censored either so what are you referring to? \n\nEDIT: Just checked, HotStar is definitely not censored either. \n\nEDIT2: I stand corrected. Netflix and Prime do censor in India. \n\nEDIT3: As pointed out (politely and then rudely) by u/LuciferinBeastMode below Netflix and Prime are actually uncensored and HotStar just has the HBO lineup uncensored. Apparently there are hoax articles out there claiming censorship where there isn't any, don't fall for them like I did just because people on here preach it. \n\nFINAL EDIT: Not going to be replying on this topic anymore since both pro and anti piracy sides have decided to start taking shots at me. I thought a civil discussion would be possible here, it clearly isn't. \n\nThanks for your time. Just stream, it's affordable enough. "
"Piracy was a great leveler. We won that battle. There are still distribution agreements in place that make it difficult to bring all content immediately to streaming. Services are working to bring as much content to you as they can and they've already brought in a LOT. As you said the impetus is on both sides and as consumers it's time for us to show some good faith. \n\nIf there's a broadcaster/distributor quite obviously ripping you off and denying service then yeah, I can get behind your point but that really isn't the case anymore from a broader perspective. \n\nSure, if it's something like the Green Day Musical then your only option to watch it is to pirate it. I can completely understand something like that being the case but with most movies and TV shows they will soon be brought onto a streaming service so I don't really think your point holds weight anymore. \n\nIt did once but as I said I believe that fight is done. We won it. So maybe it's time for consumers to start showing a bit of good faith.\n\nPlus, a lot of people use your point as a blanket reason to pirate everything. So you miss out on one show? That's no reason not to pay for the hundreds of others you can legally access. \n\nThat said India still lacks a decent provider for anime streaming. It sucks. There are plenty of anime I wish I could rewatch but I'm still not using it as an excuse to pirate them because there's enough media out there. Say what you want but I'm going to stick to my guns on this. :) \n\nHowever, I appreciate you being civil about it so lets agree to disagree. \n\nEDIT: As a counter-point to myself, pirate the shit out of EA. They're bad and deserve to feel bad. I personally just boycott them but I'm more than happy to look the other way when they're being pirated into oblivion. "
'Any one who reaches the top tier of anything gets a lot of money. '
"He doesn't. The ball is now in the government's court. Will the government now amend the flag code to formalize what is presumably a highly popular (if legally atrocious) judgement? Or will they just let this slide and decide not to formalize it? I think they will do the former.\n\nIf they choose to avoid formalizing the judgement, will SC decide to scrap its own CJI's order? More importantly, will most theaters cease to voluntarily screen the national anthem? If they do, will mobs cease to harass people who don't stand up?\n\nFor the foreseeable future, the national anthem will probably play before movies at the cinema. And if we know what's good for us, we will have to stand too."

"It is sad that this incident happened but to tell the truth the club is elitist towards paying non members too. DGC doesn't allow non members to sit in the same clubhouse as members; let alone maids.\n\nThere was a case at one of the tournaments when a former caddy turned pro was winning and yet he chose to hang out in the caddy shack rather than the club house. \n\nDelhi golf club is one of the most difficult clubs to get into. (The waiting list is about 40 years and takes sifarish from multiple members). Even guest privileges for members are restricted- You can only invite a certain number of guests.  Being in the middle of the city means it gets all the fancy elite crowd. \n\nThe club itself is on public land and pays 1 rupee as lease per year. Memberships are expensive for non government applicants. Babus and politicians get a priority entry.  The urban development ministry gets to nominate a few members. Everyone is happy. \n\nBottomline..golf clubs are exclusive by design. As much as it is unfortunate and a sign of our classist society, nothing much is going to happen in this case.  "

'Honestly i used to hate BJP before 2014 elections but after Modi came to power i was so surprised cause of the how the younger generation supported him and i was so happy we youngsters started taking our country politics seriously\n\ni was disappointed here and there at start nothing serious but when Raghu Ram Rajan left ,i felt bad and then main issue started for me was  when Demonetization happened i did\'t feel it was wrong but i couldn\'t even open my mouth about Demonetization cause if i asked anything regarding Demonetization on online forums i was termed anti national and they gave me lessons saying  "you  should be proud to stand on queue and help India fight corruption"\n\nhow can i not speak out and ask questions about my own govt  .as a citizen of this country i have every right to ask questions or criticize the govt in a healthy manner but asking simple question like "is the govt doing well" makes one decide \n\ni can have the right to decide who comes to power but i can\'t ask about them cause its out of syllabus \n\nthis guy has made a standup regarding the same way i felt\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZHtjPlCcvg'

"Congratulations due also to Rahul Gandhi. Had met Nitish four days ago with advice not to break the 'Mahagathbandhan'. "
'Modi has tweeted about it which means BJP is going to support Nitish now. '
'So this wraps up 2019 folks.  All hopes of the left trying to launch a "mahaghatbandhan" is now down in the dumps.'
'Let me get some popcorn, this is going to be interesting  '
'Not that I care about BJP, but whatever it takes to get rid of the Lalu family from Bihar. They are the parasites that completely destroyed law and order for 15 years, and they need to be thrown out ASAP. \n\nIf that means even Nitish Kumar joining NDA, so be it. And to be honest, Nitish Kumar might be a somewhat of a Drama Queen (just like in the Manjhi incident), he is the best hope for Bihar.'
'Wonder what role did Rahul Gandhi / Congress play in this. Raga had met Nitish 4 days back. However he influenced, he clearly has a magical touch ;)'
'Great leadership by Shri. Rahul Gandhi. '
"Those who are knowledgable about Bihar politics, will this move strengthen Nitish's position in Bihar? Will he form a coalition with BJP? Is that beneficial for him?"
'Whatever happens,Atleast this decision will save democracy in Bihar from parasites of Lalu family.'
"wow. Nitish has baited the seat again. Whether it'll strengthen/Weaken his position will be quite important event for 2019 elections."
'Expected move. Nitish has been siding with bjp for quite a while now. \n\nAs i read from a post here on reddit, nitish is good guy who is more pro development than others. This move keeps his image clean and allows him to increase his chances of coming back to governance'
"Great bit of politics by BJP. Today, they have won the 2019 elections. Nitish was the only credible face that could lead a united opposition alliance against them. Not that it was very likely, but, it was the only way BJP could be threatened. Now, they've finished off that threat.\n\nLalu left with *thenga* that he deserves to. "
'Lol!!! Aur banoa Mahagathbandhan. This is surgically executed. Congress and RJD look clear villians here.\n\nAmit Shah / Modi at play.'
'It is official now. Bjp will support JDU in Bihar.'
"Someone with a clean image like him should've never been associated with the Lalu family. BJP alliance always made most sense. "
' JDU + BJP is the best combo for Bihar.  '
'TIL a few minutes is a long time in politics. BJP support on way to JDU, the last I read.'
"Now it's very easy for him to form govt with BJP. Politics at its best!"
'I was hoping that this coalition will survive till 2019. Then the assembly election could take place along with general election. '
'Smart move, nobody likes to be surrounded by the foolish people. '
'First movers advantage. Setting up for 2019 already good Mr. Nitish Kumar already?\n\n#Mahagandbandhan now as someone said!'
'Nitish to join Congress and become leader of opposition in Lok sabha. Congress to fight next elections under him. That is what Rahul promised him in their meeting.'
'Sources should consult with BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh if there was any "tantrik" involved in this!\n\nUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, can throw some more light on whether this time the tantrik was involved in "plotting against their own alliance partners"\n\nWill Lalu prove "he\'s a bigger tantrik than others…a mahatantrik"?\n\nMeanwhile Modiji congratulating his right hand man the RealTantrik for bringing in two mangoes with one stone!\n\nHowever, will Nitish ji be having the last laugh? Only time will tell.\n\n'
"Nitish 'Machiavelli' Kumar showing his true colours - turns out to be a power hungry opportunist. Anybody who thinks this is about corruption is naive - he didn't know the dirty, rotten secrets of Lalu clan, and 99% of all politicians, from all parties, before allying with them? Ha! \n\nPlayed one side against the other to win, jumped out of the boat at the first sign of a storm. \n\nGood riddance I say! At least this spineless snake will not be the 'PM candidate' any more. I can't help but think this is what it was all about. \n\nFor all you folks writing the epitaphs of the Mahagathbandhan - don't. JDU leaving the alliance is no big deal. Whatever credit they had was because of their position in the Alliance. They have no national standing - congratulations to them for becoming BJP's Bhaday ka Tatu. I'll be interested to see how their spokespersons like Pavan Verma justify this move - after years of speaking against BJP's communalism. I won't be surprised if we an exodus from JD-U. Opportunist Nitish has destroyed his party's credibility. Well done. "
"And this is how Modi wins 2019..it's sad, that the clever PM has lured away the only possible fulcrum of opposition to clear his path for saffron-populism.. "
'Modi got what he wanted, now happy as gay with reuniting with nitish'
"It's fucking embarrassing though.  \n\nPM takes weeks to issue a statement on the many ridiculous things that happen in the country where he is called out to speak/issue-statement for days before it actually happens if at all.   \n\nHere barely a few hours later he is making a clearly Political statement. Which is fair on its own but not when the pattern with other instances is on record not quite staright and honest.  \n\nOverall good development because Lalu and his kids need to suffer and be rid from politics. People of Bihar are still not learning and electing these clowns."
'And he won 2015 because of vote consolidation.'
"Keep dreaming. you think someoone who has [perfected backstabbing his allies](https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/nitish-kumar-the-rank-opportunist-who-would-do-anything-for-power) won't do it again? I am betting Nitish Kumar will suddenly realise he is a true secular politician and come back to the Congress for another baptism. "
'It anyways was a cake walk.  Lol'
'Pretty much. '
"Nope. If Priyanka Gandhi enters active politics, Congress has a chance to score 150+ seats. It's all about oratory and she is a good orator "

The feat was achieved by environmentalist and lawyer Afroz Shah and his band of volunteers, who along with the support of the BMC, have put in 85 weeks of hard work in the task. A total of five million kg of garbage was cleared from the beach.\n\nOn June 5, celebrated as World Environment Day, senior officials from UN-India will join Shah and the team in the beach clean-up drive. "We are happy to see that the efforts put by all of us have helped in making the beach completely clean. Clearing 5 million kg of garbage was no mean feat. However, the challenge now is to maintain it," said Shah, who was felicitated with the Champions of Earth Award at Cancun in Mexico in December 2016 by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In the next couple of months, Shah plans to take the initiative to other beaches in Mumbai. A move he hopes will not only keep the city clean, but conserve marine animals.\n\nThe initiative was launched by Shah and his late 84-year old neighbour Harbansh Mathur in October 2015. As weeks went by, hundreds of people voluntarily participated in the initiative. The BMC also supported the cause by supplying the machinery and workers to transport the garbage that was removed from the sea and sent to the dumping ground. "After the UN tie-up, we will do the beach clean-up activity at other beaches in Mumbai. Currently, we are in the process of chalking out a plan.\n\nThere are many people, not only India, but from across the world who are approaching us as they want to replicate the same model. We will continue with the clean up even in monsoon, and would urge more people to come forward and join us," he added. There are more than 1,000-2,000 citizens who have already taken part in the initiative started by shah along with hundreds of workers associated with BMC.\n\nThe beach clean-up activity will be carried out on Saturday and Sunday where citizens will come to the beaches and pick up the plastic.

'Just a patch. The trash will re surface again due to the very mindset. Fix the latter. In India all enforcement should start with top down instead of the other way around.'
'Trash be like: "BRB gonna be back in a week"'
'Today , I was travelling in Ahmedabad bound train, saw some Gujrati  speaking aunties, very fat around 100+ ...\n\nThey were eating burger, patties, with lots of sausage  , chips , fried potatoes,Waffles and puri. They were littering like anything, throwing used  news paper,  polythene bags on tracks, throwing water in compartment . \n\nHeaviest of them start laughing  and suddenly her disc slipped and every one stop eating .\n'
"How about you don't throw shit around in the first place ? "
'I wonder how much lost valuables were found on the cleaning day by the volunteers. Also, this is a great news. Something must be done to prevent further littering.'
'wish there was some sort of movement/ngo in Delhi too, would love to join it.'
'where was all the collected trash thrown? hopefully not into the sea'
'Install bins first. \n\nYou know I was in bangalore recently. I live in Kochi which is unlike bangalore in some respect. And my god, bangalore feels like its burning, like the city is literally on fire, why? I walked past a road and at the corner there was a pile, huge pile of smelly trash set on fire and this road had some reputed hotels and malls on the other side. I saw a person spit `paan` right in front of me. I saw another person who halted a mini traffic because he wanted to wash the road in font of a `temple`, to cleanse it. \n\nTell me, where is this coming from and how are we going to fix it? It looks like after being 1000 years a slave we have taken freedom to the real next level. '
'massive corruption in municipalities. Municipalities auction off cleaning to private players who under pay and under employ staff and bribe the inspectors. So , for example in my area the road cleaners show up once a week while the municipal corporation website proudly talks about cleaning streets every day. '
'>Beaches should be divided up into sections and assigned to schools\n\nOr we should ask for greater accountability for local municipal departments to actually do their jobs. '
'> Beaches should be divided up into sections and assigned to schools with signs posted, e.g. "this section adopted by st. Georges". Once a week, students should be brought in to clean up for extra credit on their report card.    \n\nWill the Municipal taxes & Swachh Bharat Cess go to the students or will they continue going to the Govt?'
"lel copy paste doesn't always work. We have to find new ways based on our kulcha. People from multiple fields should come together & work on acheiving a sustainable solution to our garbage & open defecation problems. Start in a small village to try out new solutions. Maybe it can be a good startup idea."
'Instead of helping out or even applauding this effort, our netizens would rather say shit like this\n\n>The advantage of being last is you have a trail set by those who lead. We just need to adopt ideas that work in the developed world. One off efforts may not have a lasting effect. A recurring permanent solution is required.\n\nPathetic.'
"Maybe the government could increase funding based on how clean the school tried to keep the nearby areas as. We'd find a lot more drives to do this stuff then..."
'We have pretty serious fines for littering here'
'You are asking good questions. '
'And here I thought Hyderabad was the most gorgeous city in this country. '
'lol parents are not paying through their nose only to have there students doing cleaning at the beaches '
'I am guessing a lot of old dirty sand would be washed away during high tides or monsoons. \n\nMaybe not pristine as some other beaches, but Sea will clean it up over time'
'This is an ideal solution. Children in Japan are raised to show concern for the state of their surroundings and for those who must perform menial labor by taking part in the maintenance of their school. They have rotating responsibilities ranging from trash cleanup to preparing food.'

'"I am still alive, if you need extra money I will give, you just focus on studies"\n\nJudging by the downvotes, seems like a lot of people on this sub haven\'t lived in India. Parents actually take offence when the kids say they want to work. And sometimes think part time jobs at low paying positions are beneath them.'

Any action undertaken has to be lawful; it has to fit in with the general provisions of the law and the Aircraft Act. We are seeing how this whole approach should work. We have to see if this action of the airlines is within the framework of law," Jayant Sinha, Union minister of state for aviation, told TOI.\n'

His honour as an MP has been hurt and he has been mistreated. We must stand by him," Thackeray apparently told MPs in New Delhi over the phone from Mumbai.'
'Serves this asshole right. Awesome responses by airlines.\n'
"This should be an open and shut case. Apart from AI staffers, shouldn't there be any video/audio evidence (black box etc - aviation enthusiasts, please confirm) against the MP? He should be getting convicted in a week.\n\nIn the absence of rule of law in the country, it's a good thing that at least the airlines association are standing up for one of their own rather than bowing down to the powers that be."

"agreed. people here are sheep, taught by gandhi worshippers who modified all history to glorify only gandhi, and not other great men who actually did fight for our freedom. gandhi is an overrated old man, without whom we could have attained independence earlier,without the partition, and gained an excellent statesman, Sardar Patel, as our prime minister.

It should be possible for us, especially responsible Ministers, to be able to tell the public that the freedom for which the Congress has started the movement, already belongs to the representatives of the people."\n\nBut Congress is supposed to be anti-national and sanghis are the proud nationalists according to the revisionist history that BJP is peddling.\n\n\n\n'
'Very true.

So naturally politicians capitalize on this and inevitably we are left with some unfortunate holes in our social fabric - whether its the fact that different people have different laws, or the fact that this situation makes people unhappy. \n   \n'

If they want to they can agree to not invite Taslima without taking the permission of some Muslim Body. That has nothing to do with FoE or FoS. Unless, of course, the Muslim group has some political power."
"Politics in India is the Art of Polarisation. All parties do it, in fact they thrive on it. Appealing to religious sentiments gives them the easy way to win votes without actually doing any work for the upliftment of the masses.\n\nAnd most people in India are too stupid, uneducated and full of 'religious sentiments' to not fall in their trap. So I would not blame the politicians alone, people get the politicians they deserve."
'Which secular party is doing it in this particular case?'
"This is a really common and irritating talking point. It really puzzles me when I hear that liberals oppose UCC. I can't seem to find a single article that names individuals who oppose UCC, except for Amnesty Internationals Aakaar Patel. I am yet to find a liberal among my colleagues, friends and relatives who is short of enthusiastically supporting UCC, even though many breathe fire and brimstone when they think of the RSS. There are tons of secular or atheists in urban India, who like the idea of separating religious and civic practices. I'm not the only one. \n\nAgain, if some people of liberal bent voice support for it, why are they being held as the 'one true liberal voice'? "

"It's a lot worse here than in any Western country. Islam doesn't exactly promote secularism and their religion already condemns polytheists so I don't understand why INC and the like continue to pander to them. It may attract more votes, but at what cost. \n\n>in muslim communities wrt women, homosexuals\n\nAlso, to be fair, while that might be in the West, I wouldn't really say Hindus by and large are that progressive about women, homosexuality etc as well. The argument against Islam is that it stifles progress (esp. wrt scientific research) and threatens secularism and peace in the country."

"The very concept of 'kafir' and the active proselytising. \n\nThe dogmatic and arcane concepts of heresy and apostasy don't exist in any Vedas or Upnishads. "
"It is a question of politics and idealogy. Just as the BJP and Sangh Parivar have to some extent usurped the 'Hindu' platform in public life, similarly left-wing political parties and establishment figures sympathizing with them(Media, academics, filmmakers, authors etc) have usurped the term 'liberal' for pushing their own agendas.\n\nBeneath their noble ideals and preaching of tolerance most of them are driven by cold political/ideological calculations. For example they will be deliberately silent on or even supportive of extremists from minority religions because such people support the 'secular' parties they are allied with. "
"Congress will start, we care about Muslims, so UCC can't be enforced on Muslims. Sonia Gandhi made it absolutely clear, Congress will always support caste system, because it's there legacy, and another reason is lower caste people will vaporize if reservation is not provided.\n\nSmall regional parties won't talk about this.\n\nMedia will jump like a whore telling everyone, this is Hindu nationalism, and should be stopped at any cost. Didn't you see how media covered award wapsi, useless writers became heros overnight. Barkha and Rajdep sardesai are still alive. Pranab Roy won't retire soon and even if he will, he will appoint someone more radical than him.\n\nNo one will oppose directly, but leftists will prefer to get some political mileage from UCC. Most Muslims are backward, and they won't allow. Because, anything against Islam is strictly prohibited and if they accept this one, BJP/RSS/Majority might enforce something more dangerous in future.\n\nCongress will eventually die, and parties like Trinamool congress will try to appease minority as much as possible. Mamata Bhattacharya won't hesitate to kill few Hundred Hindus to appease Muslims."

"Endorsing Herbalife may contravene his effort to craft a new socially conscious brand though. It's been accused of being a glorified MLM scheme that defrauds its customers. I do not know what is the state of investigations in to the company stand now, Illinois was investigating MLM claims back in 2015. Last I heard was Carl Icahn bought more Herbalife shares while Bill Ackman shorted it. Of course both are respectively vested in promoting and demeaning it. \n\n"
"I think this is a marketing ploy. Pepsi aren't a small company that can take this PR hit and not take any action.\n\nThere must be more to this gimmick. Such loud declarations against a global brand lead to lawsuits. And, at PepsiCo level brand protection is holy grail. No way Virat gets away with shaming the brand publicly without an alternate strategy. \n\nPepsi might move him towards their more perceived healthier brand like Gatorade or they might have plans to launch something new like an energy drink against Red Bull and want an ambassador for that.\n\nNo way Pepsi is going to let Virat Kohli walk away from a lucrative contract for which they outbid competitors based on a change of mood. Let's be more practical over this situation than assume a Herbalife ambassador suddenly grew a conscience.\n "

'
'However, Kohli ji promote royal challenge "sports drink"'
'It must be easy to grow a moral fibre after endoring the same products for 6 years, making the millions first.'
'Dude has an amazing PR team. They are improving his brand value by making him a more "likable" icon by pitching this as an integrity move or as an example of his social responsibility. Did he happen to stop drinking Pepsi the day the current endorsement contract ended, and hence he decided to not renew it? Did he give up any portion of his past earnings from either deal? If this is really about integrity and principle, how can he live with the guilt of having cheated the millions of people who chose the products because they were influenced by his endorsement?\n\n\nHas either PepsiCo or the makers of Fair & Whatever corroborated this story? I mean, in a very rather scenario, one could argue that it could have been any one of a possible 100 crore reasons, including, but not limited to, the number of such 100 crores that the companies were willing to pay for Kohli\'s services.

'he\'s making an ad. he\'s getting paid crores for the ad, which people say is insane, because our perception of fairness is that two days of work should not gain him crores in compensation. but clearly, the ad is worth a lot more than kohli is paid, otherwise they wouldn\'t pay him. why is it worth so much? because it contributes to increased profits. who do the profits go to? in most companies, they go to the owners or majority shareholders. and in a lot of cases, the owners are the owners because they had the money to set up the business, and then the leverage to hire other people and pay them as little as they could, keeping the rest as profit.\n\nan even more streamlined case is when athletes get paid crores for just playing (or singers for singing, or actors for acting), and everyone says that\'s a sign of society being fucked up. but think about all the money being generated by having that athlete out on the field in the first place. where does the bulk of it go? almost certainly to the team owner, the stadium owner, and a lot of other people with "owner" in their name.\n\nthe thing is, no one gets indignant about how much money you make from owning something. somehow the rich-get-richer effect is seen as right and proper; it is just when labour gets an unusually large cut that it looks "insane".'

'I see your question, and the Video Links provided by you - both the CM full speech (watched 2 times on my own, and another 2 times with group of two separate Delhites), and the AajTak local Video - watched once on my own, and it is ridiculous to give it more views. And STILL came up short on answers to some very basic questions.\n\nDisclaimer: as an ex Delhite, and involved administration of Institutes - I\'ve some skin in the game, even though I\'ve since left Delhi and no longer personally affected. But anyways, the two groups I mentioned above, who I called and sat through as we listened to CM\'s speech to make sure we get the answers for the concerns that are in play - at least for the limited demographic that constitutes the temp. teachers and the once that hope to be regularized.\n\n\nWith that introduction, here are the questions that remain unanswered from the CMs speech\n\n* What is the stand of this bill on the open competitive recruitment of teachers? \n* What is govt\'s action or stand on the 2001 HC directive to DSSSB to have no open vacancies at the start of academic year. Is that order to be implemented, or not?\n* LG has asked, or advised, or threatened - whatever version you may pick up from CM speech - to treat this matter under the "services" sector and not education sector. In the past Delhi CM has advised lot of teachers to approach the LG for their grievances. Now, where do these teachers go? to CM, or to LG? or we find some independent MLA to present a private bill on our behalf?\n\n\nI see lot of anti-BJP, anti=LG posturing in the videos presented- and from the news.\n\nBut honestly, if there are answers to the aforementioned questions, it\'d of of help and actual work and not theatrics.\n\n'

By doing what they are doing, they are showing the whole nation what they truly are and I'm sure there are a lot of votes that will go to the Congress even where there is no AAP, because we can see that they are blocking good work and playing dirty politics.\n\nSo insecure, BJP."

">A lifecycle analysis conducted by EWG that took into account the production and distribution of 20 common agricultural products found that red meat such as beef and lamb is responsible for 10 to 40 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as common vegetables and grains.\n\n>Livestock are typically fed corn, soybean meal and other grains which have to first be grown using large amounts of fertilizer, fuel, pesticides, water and land. EWG estimates that growing livestock feed in the U.S. alone requires 167 million pounds of pesticides and 17 billion pounds of nitrogen fertilizer each year across some 149 million acres of cropland. The process generates copious amounts of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide, while the output of methane—another potent greenhouse gas—from cattle is estimated to generate some 20 percent of overall U.S. methane emissions.\n\n>“If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,” reports ecologist David Pimentel of Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. He adds that the seven billion livestock in the U.S. consume five times as much grain as is consumed directly by the entire U.S. population.\n\n>Our meat consumption habits also cause other environmental problems. A 2009 study found that four-fifths of the deforestation across the Amazon rainforest could be linked to cattle ranching. And the water pollution from factory farms (also called concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs)—whereby pigs and other livestock are contained in tight quarters—can produce as much sewage waste as a small city, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Further, the widespread use of antibiotics to keep livestock healthy on those overcrowded CAFOs has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that threaten human health and the environment in their own right.\n\n-Scientific American, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meat-and-environment/\n\nAlso, Dairy is not great either tbh. Yes it is less harmful than beef production, given that different breeds and diet result in less methane and nitrous, but it's not a necessary food and it is still pretty harmful."
"Well you try to fatten the cow more - meaning more water. It's going to let out more methane in the process. The quantity, sureity of out put will automatically make it the meat of choice and fast replace other meat in production etc.. "
'Yup. TN might not have religious fights but it sure does have caste related fights. :('
'i dont know what place you come from, but my favorite evening snacks is beef fry and is sold quite common in TN towns and cities.  \n\nand dont get confused with maatu pongal and eating beef, most of educated tamils do understand life cycle of cow.'
'If you knew anything about domestic beef consumption you would know that domestically we consume mainly tough meat of old cattle, not tender meat of cattle raised specifically for consumption. If you are so concerned about the environment, banning beef export will help far more than banning domestic consumption. Domestic consumption fades in comparison to the amount of beef exported. '

Being the wife of most powerful man during emergency is probably not a bad position. If questions need be asked about it, the ideal person to direct them to is Maneka. The fact that she consistently gets some post in govt who ever be in power is consistent with nepotism against which BJP stood(or at least appeared to stand). BJP never fails to deride congress(quite rightly) for emergency but its hypocrisy is that it has given room to Maneka Gandhi who's only qualifying factor is that she is the wife of  Sanjay Gandhi.

It is predominantly security as a lot of vital identifying info are lying around with god knows what encryption. That's why I said the execution is the problem. If the govt had the infrastructure and technology to have properly executed it, there would not have been any issue. The govt already holds record of all our identity, it is just that Aadhar is linking them - which is good for a country like India."

"I was that someone who wished Amazon would change their ways when it comes to their video content. \n\nThis is a bit more complicated. Denigrating national symbols is a criminal offense and the language is deliberately left vague so that the government can target pretty much anyone they don't like. The Supreme court has a much narrow interpretation but we all know that for most going through the court system to get to a trial is an ordeal in itself. \n\nThese leaders know clearly that mere threats would make most of the population back down and comply because no one wants to deal with our courts. \n\nMy intention to pressure Amazon is born out of the belief that they can take on our government and win very easily because the law is on their side and yet Amazon chose the easy way out."

"all you guys are morons. if you are opposing sushma swaraj because you think flags are silly or that it is silly to have rules like the indian flag shouldn't be on door mats or on chaddis, then I am with you.\n\nbut like it or not india has strict rules related to its flag. as a minister of  the GoI, sushma is supposed to uphold those laws. yes, this is happening in another country. but GoI must do anything within its capabilities and which is reasonable to address the issue. The western countries, like US and Canada go to far more extremes if something that irks them happens anywhere in the world."
">A) Amazon is not producing the flag doormats \n\nRight if i host a website that allows users to sell sex slaves , guns and drugs even then I'm totally innocent. Selling footware and doormats with national flag has been banned for a long time in India , every country has its own laws example you can't find sex toys in Amazon.in but hundreds in Amazon.uk\n\n>B) It's not just the Indian flag \n\nSo ?  That logic is like saying those terrorists aren't attacking hindus they are attacking multiple religion .my examples maybe extreme but it paints a clear picture of the circumstance.\n\n\n\n>C) Random foreign flag doormat company not worth outrage \n\n\nNo, its offensive in indian subcontinent unlike the west , we find it it extremely offensive if people even touch stuff from their feet . That's like comparing selling pork in Arabiab and USA.\n\n\n>D) It is not even on Amazon India \n\nGood point. Non the less its accessible by India meaning Indians . If they don't comply the .com site will be blocked.\n\n>E) Will hit nothing but investment climate in India.\n\nThis is nothing new and require mediocre tinkering , it's affecting no one  in India. "
">E) Will hit nothing but investment climate in India.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with you, but think of the hurdles and hardcore censorship investors deal with in China. We can criticise Swaraj and Modi and anyone else on fair grounds but not draw doomsday predictions into this."
"Very surprised to see shocking, stupid and half-baked arguments over here that this will affect investment environment in India. For records, India is perhaps the only option for global co to chase their double digit growth target. \nChina has been arm twisting global companies for a while (patent sharing with local companies, censorship) but dare a global company say they do not want to invest in China given an opportunity. Amazon has been cornered to a petty seller on Alibaba's platform in China and India seems to be the last battleground to win where Amazon can expect double digit growth, lest it wins over local competition. \nDo you think it will ever affect Amazon's decision or for that matter any global companies decision to not invest in India?\n\nAs for this matter, I feel MEA definitely went too far but Amazon needs to get its act together and avoid such issues with more sincerity if it has to do business in India and if it harbours any ambition of winning the e-commerce market in India. \n\nIt's a stupid product to be sold anyways irrespective of the fact whether it was sold in India or outside and Amazon should acknowledge and put in place mechanisms to ban such lame products. As for the people here who are criticising the Govt.'s reaction and complaining that it will affect the investment climate in India, let me tell you that Indian market is so lucrative that global companies need to amend their ways to do business here and not the other way around."
"The excitement of upholding the right to sell doormats 'irrespective' is curious in this thread...\n\n The Indian flag is a symbol of our country. It symbolises India. We celebrate it and revere it. Some idiot decided that it would be a good idea to make a doormat out of this.. And the arguments are 'Amazon is not producing it but only selling it' ...  Amazon is not selling it in India'.. ' Its not the only flag doormat', so its somehow OK to do it. I am genuinely surprised at the vehemence of the comments ITT \n\n\nThe reverse outrage is outrageous in my opinion. "

'That is not the crux of the issue. The issue is the difference between "Bringing it to Amazon\'s attention" versus saying "Do this or I will rescind your visas", basically giving them mafia-like threats, with full knowledge that Amazon has a giant market and creates jobs in the country as well as hires many people in USA.\n\nIf Amazon has an equally provocative CEO, they can easily tweet back, "Okay fine, All Indian jobs are going to China. We are shutting down all Amazon offices in India and firing everyone tomorrow." '
'> My intention to pressure Amazon is born out of the belief that they can take on our government and win very easily because the law is on their side and yet Amazon chose the easy way out\n\nReminds me of the effort the Italian (or perhaps it was German or both?) print media tried to force on google where they said Google had to pay them if it linked any news articles found in searches by its engine. Long story made short..Google delisted the whole bunch and print media cried it was unfair as they lost even MORE revenue.\n'
">  out of the belief that they can take on our government and win very easily because the law is on their side\n\nAfter Amazon launched, our 'government', that too a state one, refused to authorize their second warehouse (in Bangalore) for no particular reason using random grey area loopholes\n\nhttps://www.nextbigwhat.com/karnataka-government-bans-amazon-selling-product-bangalore-warehouse-297/\n\nIt seems like a small deal now, but back then Amazon had just one warehouse in India, and this warehouse was supposed to handle more than 50% of the country's demand at the time for a few months, and our government apparatus refused to let it be used for months. Eventually only 1 seller was given permission to use the warehouse.\n\nAmazon clearly knew the law was on their side, they don't invest millions of dollars on such properties without due diligence, but were still rendered helpless."

The mafia doesn't do that, Mumbai police ensures smooth day to day transaction of Mafia business and gets paid by the Mafia. A win win for every one including the public. Public doesnt need worry about shoot outs. Mafia doesnt worry about police and police doesnt worry about public outcry due to mafia shootouts and also both Mafia and police get rich."

So, BJP with 0.8% is in-fact better than the general population.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: In fact, let's take out BJP's legislators from the pool completely. For the non-BJP crowd, (51-14)/(4896-1750) = ~1.18% face cases related to crimes against women. Therefore, relative to a BJP legislator, a non-BJP legislator is 47.5% more likely of committing a crime against women."

'The point here is that the BJP was elected for a platform claiming it is different from other parties, and it takes corruption seriously.

The current BJP, however, as spoken at length about cronyism within the Congress party and how the part shields members who are corrupt and have committed crimes.\n\nIn that regards, one would expect the BJP to boot any such members from its party immediately, regardless of what percentage of its party is made of such people.'

A lot of American parents are quicker to blame the teachers rather than admit their kids' shortcomings.\n\nI disagree pretty strongly with OP on the issue of visas though, especially H-1B visas. My parents have been IT recruiters for major companies for 20+ years now. They have discussed their experience with many companies using cheaper Indian IT folks to undercut American labor. H-1B visas are supposed to be used to address talent shortages. Tech companies always use the line that there aren't enough competent STEM graduates for their needs; the reality is that they aren't willing to pay market rates for US tech people when they can use a loophole to get around that market instead. "
"That was an interesting read. You're a good guy OP. \n\nIndian parents in general are very invested in their kid's education and the kids growing up have very little personal freedom. Kids tend not to have an individual identity I feel by being mollycoddled all the time. I just wish the parents would give their kid's a chance to pursue their lives/education on their own. This is the only issue I find with Indian parents in US. "
"You don't have to put down one group to praise some aspects of another. I realize that this is your personal perspective and i thank you for sharing it though."
"> On average, if something had an educational purpose, like a national/international science or humanities competition or an academic text, the Indian parents would be far more willing to spend money on it than the white American ones. \n\nThanks for being a good human being.\n\nEven poor parents go beyond their means in supporting their child's education.  That is how most parents who want to uplift their families are.  And for decent Indians, they are selfish about their children and families, because they have nothing else in their life than their children and family's well being, as their legacy to look back."
"Western : 'ignorance is bliss' \nEastern : 'you are stuck in ignorance because of maya(illusion) go beyond maya and experience bliss' "
">I also learned, even though I had previously studied philosophy extensively, that clear antecedents of many important concepts in western philosophy can be found in various Hindu texts, which western authors typically don't credit. \n\nDid you read the actual Hindu texts, or were you informed this by some of the Indian parents and took their word for it?"
"> So many people are so quick to demand visa cuts and some are even quick to pull a trigger, but if they tried to learn something from the people they want to go away, maybe they might find a real solution to their problems. \n\nWe've had another recent white American creating a very similar type thread a week ago or so, and while he made a lot of crowd-pleasing points, he also exposed a lot of ignorance of his own ignornace, so I had mixed feelings about that thread. I'm seeing a pattern here. H1B is deeply broken and it's being used to undercut labour. To rant against the American native population is probably a cathartic experience for you OP, since the election, but it doesn't change the fact that the program is not about skills and more about wagecosts. Many H1B visa workers work for Disney or utility companies. H1B was created for *top tier* talent, and top tier talent is today paid 100K or more. H1B is at 60K, which tells you everything you need to know. \n\nThe other American poster ranted a lot about excessive American individualism and praised Indian collectivism. I pointed out that only [5% of Indian women](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/65-indian-women-literate-5-have-sole-control-over-choosing-their-husband-71113) have sole control over their choice of husband. What you're experiencing is the most Westernised elite of the Indian population. You're *supposed* to get along with them and I'm genuinely happy that you did. \n\nBut my advice to you is the same I gave to him: in your rush to condemn your fellow Americans, keep in mind that you're experiencing some of the best and well-adapted people Indians(albeit being 2nd generation). The average Indian is nothing like them and they are voting for a Hindu nationalist party is record numbers. I have a feeling that you're not big on right-wing politics nor on nationalism and if you were a minority in India, you would probably be a bit more balanced in your assessment. \n\nThe point here is to add nuance to your rant. Indian-Americans have an excellent reputation (by and large) in the US and for very good reasons. You just gave us some of them. But I'd also caution you to draw too many conclusions and remind you to guard yourself against myopia, in your rush to condemn your own nation. "
"And also a good teacher. That's why they respect him and like him."

'There are certainly things about a more individualistic society that I prefer as well. But, I think there is potentially a lot of room for finding some sort of compromise or happy medium between the two. \n\n'
'>do you think that most Americans (Maybe most White Americans) \n\nObviously not white, but based on what I have seen, it really depends on location. If they live in a more diverse suburb/city and are exposed to other cultures, then no, they tend to be more open-minded. \n\nThe ignorant ones are usually from the Midwest/South. They\'re not necessarily bad people (in fact, I\'ve found people in Kansas to be a bit more hospitable than in California) but they live in mostly homogeneous and closed off communities. Most of what they know about minorities come from the news so it\'s usually not that favorable. \n\nThen there\'re the rich white liberals of New England. They live in homogeneous communities as well but they\'re more the "champagne socialist" types that preach one thing but live another.'
"As the OP mentioned a lot of Americans have a sense of entitlement which makes them less willing to work harder and hence the need for Indian workers - the fact that they would happily work for less pay is an additional benefit. \n\nI work with an Indian service company and most of my staff gets paid three times the normal rate for locals in South East Asia. However, we are forced to recruit from India. It's not about money, but about skills and competitiveness."
"There were a couple issues where I found myself pushing back against the culture and encouraging kids to think about their options. The two big ones were gender and career choices. A lot of people do push their kids to be Medical Doctors especially, and I did tell some kids that they carefully consider whether they actually want to practice medicine, because an MD probably isn't worthwhile if you don't want to practice medicine and there are lots of other excellent careers in the world. "
'I understand this. But I am a patriot, which means there are a lot of issues within my own culture and national politics I would like to see rectified in my lifetime. '
'sounds like midwest'
'Thanks for your perspective. What you are saying makes a lot of sense. I wanted to focus on the positive here because most of the people in this subreddit are already very clearly aware of many of the negatives and things are evolving. \n\nBut, I do believe right wing nationalism and gender issues are huge problems. I had a student tell me that her mother said she had to be married by 22 or she would be too old and a parent scream at her daughter for saying "I love you" to a boy. I thought this was absurd and I can imagine things are far worse in more undeveloped/rural areas. But I think most of the people on this sub recognize this as a problem.\n\nI also don\'t condemn America. I love my country and have good reasons for choosing to live here - I firmly believe the people I am complaining about are not the majority here. And why some people are ignorant is not sort of any inborn genetic defect or permanent problem, but rather fixable issues with the culture and education system.'

'You, me and anyone who ever loved someone from a different community.'
'Yea, that makes sense. But I have felt that even the city bred folk are still only concerned about what happens within their immediate surroundings. \n\nThe only awareness of other cultures they might have is trying out yoga, naan *bread*, chai *tea*, ramen, pho - Hope you get my point.'
"That wasn't my point. But yes, many Indians might live in a bubble - but they are at least aware of a lot more than Americans maybe, considering that Indians living in the US in this case are exposed to different cultures from a very small age.\n\nOP is talking about the Indian diaspora in the US - that's a HUGE and mostly successful community. I don't think it's really special to get to the US these days IFF you have the money - Tons of Indians move to do Masters programs (staying back post studies is a different issue). Nowadays getting a tourist visa is not that hard btw."
'Not necessarily.... It\'s about paying someone "American wage" vis a vis outsourcing or being less competitive. Most Indian companies are saying that they only make US businesses competitive. \n\nDon\'t conflate IT recruitment experience with outsourcing - which is still a very rewarding exercise.'
'>But I am a patriot, which means there are a lot of issues within my own culture and national politics I would like to see rectified in my lifetime.\n\nWe need this definition of a patriot in our country/everywhere.

"I am from the Southern US where most women and men still marry in their 20s, so marrying in your thirties is not really something I saw happening very often around or have a strong opinion on. But I do think women and men can have full and complete lives without marrying or by marrying the same sex, depending on what their goals, values, and sexual orientation is. I also do not think premarital sex and dating are necessarily bad things for 20somethings to participate in if they are safe and careful. I certainly don't think they are things to which they should be subjected to harassment for by their community. But I understand that I reflect the views of my own culture and upbringing on this matter and don't try to directly impose them on anyone. \n\nI don't support US military aid to Pakistan or think that Hindus have no morality.

Yeah, the soldiers and cooks will readily admit to food quality if their superior officer questions them, knowing full well their job might be on the guillotine if they were to spill any beans!\n\n\n> The officer said Yadav had in the past been accused of insubordination and faced court martial in 2010 on charges of pointing a gun to an officer.\n\nI want to question what made Tej Bahadur, the BSF Jawan to point a gun to an officer. Why did the 'officer' not specify that part of the story?\n\n>\n> “Considering the situation of his family and children, the force took a lenient view in Yadav’s case. Despite dismissing him, Yadav’s service was continued only after giving him 89 days RI (rigorous imprisonment).\n> \n> “Since then he was kept in the headquarters so that he can work under supervision and could not repeat such an act again.”As he submitted a letter for voluntary retirement from January 31 and it has been accepted, he was sent to the post on December 28. He was sent there 15 days ago as some soldiers were on leave.”\n\nSo you deemed him fit to go ahead with regular job and sent him to the post, so it just points to your shitty analysis of his mental ability (if he was really 'insubordinate' as you claim)"

(file photo)\n\nAn Ahmedabad court last week passed an order barring The Wire from publishing any further report on BJP president Amit Shah’s son Jay Shah’s business turnover “so that the right to live with dignity of the plaintiff (Jay) may be protected”.\n\nAdditional Senior Civil Judge B K Dasondi of Ahmedabad rural court observed that the “injunction should be granted to applicant/plaintiff (Jay)” even though notice was not served upon the opposite parties (The Wire, its editor, the writer of the article, and others).\n\nAbout not hearing arguments of the website before issuing the injunction, the order said, “…it is mandatory for this court to issue notice of such application to the opposite party (The Wire). But in the present case, it appears that if an immediate remedy is not given to the applicant, there is a chance of publishing the news, for which the present plaintiff has filed the suit.”\n\nOn October 8, The Wire had published a report stating, among other things, that the turnover of a company owned by (Amit) Shah’s son increased 16,000 times in the year following election of Narendra Modi.\n\nThe order stated, “This court is of the opinion that if the application (of Jay) is not allowed, then it may lead to prejudice with the rights and interest of the applicant.”\n\nIn his order, the judge prohibited the website from “using and publishing or printing in any electronic, print, digital or any other media, or broadcast, telecast, print and publish… in any language on the basis of article published in “The Wire” dated 8/10/17 either directly or indirectly on the subject matter with respect to plaintiff in any manner whatsoever”.\n\nThe court directed Jay to “deliver to the opposite parties (The Wire) a copy of application”.\n\nThe order was passed on October 12 on a civil suit and damage for Rs 100 crore, filed by Jay against The Wire.\n\nThe order mentions that although notice to appear has not been served to the defendants (The Wire), Jay’s advocates sought grant of “interim injunction, as serving notice to the defendants would tantamount to cause injury to the immediate legal rights of the applicants”.\n\nSenior counsel Nirupam Nanavati, who appeared for Jay, submitted, “If ad-interim injunction will not be granted, then the defendants may tarnish the reputation and dignity of the plaintiff.” He also submitted, according to the court’s order, that “procedure of serving notice for the present application would result in delay, and such delay would defeat the purpose of granting injunction…”\n\nCiting two judgments of the Delhi HC, judge Dasondi wrote, “…this court has discretionary power to grant interim relief in case where the defendants no-1 to 7 has published online news, for which the present suit has been filed by the plaintiff.

'> Bijness\n\n\nSince long, dude, since very long. How we keep falling prey to the machinations of the cunning! This is how it goes:\n\n> The creditors are for the most part Goozerat^1 waneeo^2 of the Meshree (Vaishnavite) or Shrawuk (Jain) classes. A waneeo commencing life spends his time partly in a large town and partly in some remote country village. He borrows a few rupees at interest in the town, with which he purchases small supplies of clarified butter, oil, molasses, and other such articles, and thus stocks his village shop. The cultivators having no money at hand, barter small quantities of their grain or cotton for as much oil as will keep their evening lamp burning for an hour, or for little supplies of groceries. They are perfectly unaware of the market value of their raw produce, and are quite satisfied that they have made a bargain if the waneeo, with a politic show of liberality, throws in a little more of the article he is selling under the name of a bonus. Having collected a sufficient quantity of raw produce, the trader carries it to the town, and sells it there at a favorable rate, and his capital thus augmented, he returns to the village to commence operations on a larger scale. A cultivator, perhaps, has lost his bullock ; the waneeo steps forward immediately to lend him money, at interest, to supply his loss. Or, perhaps, the Koonbee^3 is engaged in marrying his child, or in performing the funeral rites of his parent; the trader will advance him money to supply him with the clarified butter, molasses, clothes, or other articles which are indispensable on these occasions, charging for them twice their value. Sometimes the cultivator prefers to make his own purchases in the town, but he must then take the waneeo with him to act as broker between him and the town dealer, for he feels that the latter will otherwise charge him anything he pleases, and besides he has no money, and cannot borrow it except from the village lender, for the curious feeling in regard to rights, which is so prevalent among the Hindoos, applies here, and the village waneeo will consider his property invaded if any other trader propose to deal with his constituents. On these transactions the waneeo of course gains largely. Sometimes, however, he will say to the cultivator, "I have no ready money, but if you will tell me what you want we will go together and purchase it, and it shall be put down to my account,". He takes care, moreover, to hint to his victim what praises he has heard of the liberality of the family, and how necessary it is that their honor should be maintained by a large expenditure on the present occasion. He adds, that such celebrations do not happen every day, but only once or twice in a lifetime, that the money will not be thrown away, and that nothing is easier than to make it up again. He will also say, "I have every confidence in you, and am ready to advance you any sum you wish." In this way, flattering his pride, he easily plunges him deeply into debt. \n\n> There is nothing more adverse to the prosperity of the Hindoos than this unfortunate feeling of theirs in regard to money and expenditure. With them a mercantile man has "abroo " (honor), he is a respectable man, nay, a great man — " a muhajun " — by which they merely mean that he is wealthy, though he may be, indeed he too frequently is, selfish meanness itself. Similarly, a landowner or cultivator is " dheerujwalo " — a courageous, high-spirited man — that is to say, he plunges himself into irretrievable difficulties, merely because he has not strength of mind sufficient to enable him to despise the tittle-tattle of his neighbourhood. \n\n> But, to return to our waneeo :— When the occasion for all this extravagant expenditure has passed away, the waneeo demands his bond. He tells the cultivator, " You have so much to pay to the ghee-dealer, so much to the cloth-seller," and so on, to all of which the cultivator assents. The waneeo says, " Now give me my kothulee  choramun," meaning a fee for loosening the purse-strings, which must be paid in ready money, for luck, or as a good omen. The cultivator procures one per cent, in ready money, from wherever he can, and pays it. He has further, also, to make a present, not only to the person who writes, but also to those who attest the bond. Interest is stipulated for at two per cent, per mensem, or, if the terms are unusually moderate, at one. The bond prepared, the cultivator scrawls beneath it his mark — a rude representation of a plough. When the next crop is ready, and the government share has been paid, the creditor exerts himself to carry off all that remains; the cultivator, with much entreaty, obtains enough to subsist upon for a short time, and he is credited on account of the remainder with whatever the waneeo may be pleased to allow him. Sometimes the trader carries off nearly the whole, and, when the cultivator talks about a subsistence, says, "What need you care? When yours is done you can have as much as you like from my shop." Thus the cultivator is driven to the waneeo\'s shop for grain to eat, and grain to sow his field with. The terms of lending are, that the borrower shall repay twice the quantity of grain he takes away, when his crop ripens. The next harvest comes round, but now all the grain which is left, after the payment of the government demands, goes to pay for that which was borrowed last year, and there is nothing left to pay the interest of the bond. This, then, must be added to the principal, and so the bond goes on swelling year by year— the trader (who is well aware of the practice of the courts of justice) taking care to have it periodically renewed, and carefully closing every loop-hole through which his victim might escape. \n\n> The creditor will now probably reside principally in the town, and on his occasional visits to the village he puts up at the house of his debtor, who is obliged to maintain him as long as he remains there. If the waneeo have a son to many, or a pilgrimage to perform, the debtor is obliged to lend him his cart and bullocks, and on such occasions he must also come forward with the usual present. The money-lender has by this time begun to assume a very high tone, and to demand payment, threatening to sell the cultivator\'s house or his bullocks; in fact, as a villager would say, "He becomes more oppressive than a raja."\n\n> In a few years the waneeo, having thus made himself the master of numerous cultivators, amasses a large sum of money. He now turns his attention to a higher prey, and seeks to become the creditor of local chiefs and landowners. His first step is to get himself introduced to the chiefs man of business, whom he gains over by gifts and promises. This agent accordingly takes the first opportunity of praising the trader in the chief’s presence, and intimating his readiness to advance as much money as may be wished for. When occasion arrives, money is accordingly borrowed from the Sowkar^4 or Shet (at which dignity the waneeo has now arrived), and the man of business prepares a bond, and brings it to the landowner for his signature. The chief haggles like a child for a sum of ready money to be presented to him as the price of his affixing his seal, but cares little or nothing about what there is in the bond, never reflecting for a moment that he is likely to be called upon to fulfil his agreement. A few transactions of this kind lead to the inevitable termination. The Sowkar sues in the Court of Justice; the man of business (who has carefully abstained from keeping any account, lest his own peculations should be exposed) deserts his master in the hour of need ; the chief attempts to defend the suit, and while he admits that he has signed the bond, urges that he is not really indebted to one-tenth of the extent asserted ; he is informed that he must produce his accounts in order to prove his defence, and when he states that his agent never kept any, is told further that this is merely a false statement, made because the production of the books called for would prove the validity of the plaintiff\'s claim. The chief has, of course, no further defence; a decree is therefore passed, and his estate is attached. \n\n[Source]( https://archive.org/stream/rsmlrsamlorhind00forbgoog#page/n580/mode/2up/search/commencing+life)\n\n\n1: Gujarat\n\n2: Bania\n\n3: [Kunbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunbi#Etymology) (Maratha, farmer)\n\n4: Sahukar (money lender)'

"Fuck. I just saw this and scrolled over after briefly reading it. Then it appeared on my FB feed, and I realised this guy used to teach me in my first year. Fuuuck. He really did have very radical views about a lot of things, but that's the point of an educational institute!\n\nHe really is a great professor, but faces a lot of troubles only because of the fact that he expects logic to prevail."
"So where's he going to work now? Hey OP, if you can get in touch with him, then recommend either EFL University or the University of Hyderabad. Both of these are excellent for English. EFL also has a campus in Shillong, so he can always chill there if he wants\n to."
"The only way this will work out for the teacher is if he says his religion believes in homosexuality, and this is discriminatory. He should then threaten to burn the school owner's precious audi/volvo/rolls royce until he gets reservation for his religious type in the school."
'Holy shit! I saw a post on FB about this just now. These are the top two comments:\n\n"I really have no clue about the facts of the case. But I am sure that the Jesuits won\'t take nonsense from anyone. This is an institution with time tested values and systems in place."\n\n"St. JOSEPH COLLEGE IS A RESPECTABLE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. NO PLACE FOR GAYS AND LESBIANS IN TEACHING. LET THEM SHOUT FROM THE ROOF TOP."\n\nSo far every comment is in favour of the college. \n\nWhy is it always one step forward and two steps backwards with this country man?'
"In a report I read yesterday, the Principal said that the college itself is pro-LGBT rights, but that the said teacher was encouraging students to break rules. If this is the case, I am okay with Principal's decision."
"> This is the network of family, school, college and institutions in general that stymie the growth of young minds.\n\nThis sums up most of the education system very well. People don't want risks, they don't want their children to wander untrodden paths, supreme obligation to parental and other authorities"
'>As a student I can vouch for everything he said about our college and the Principal, Victor Lobo\n\nThis. Thank you for this'
'Downvoted because you hid the fact that this guy promotes paedophilia.'
'Wow, this comes as a surprise to me. I used to think that christian colleges were free places with little restrictions. \n\nI too, was in a reputed ~~christian~~ religious minority institution for a couple of years; we did have great competent faculty (english especially), but chutiyapa and bakchodi was universal as in every other college. \n\nGoing by my experience, I thought of these kind of places to be a fun institution for overall development, I never thought such horrors and insanity could take place there. '
">Yet their parents love this happening to their kids. **They agree to an SMS being sent to them every time their kids bunk one class.** \n\nWhat's wrong with this?"
"Don't know the people involved, but he seems to have some pretty strong views about the college... Why did he join/ has he been involved in speaking out against these issues until the college gave him the boot? Or was it all fine as long as the cash kept coming each month?"
"Freedom and everything is outside the college premises. Once you're in their campus, you've got to abide by their rules.\n\nThe college as an employer has every right to hire or fire someone."
"It's not that..the social climate has shifted not just in India but all around the world. We have gone from radical ideas and debates to conformity and being agreeable. "
"> These fucking religious conservatives need to realize that people who moved on from their fucking insane customs and entered the age of reason.\n\nAnd all the advancement we see nowadays that makes our lives so much more comfortable than those living in medieval periods is a resultant of people moving away from the religious-monarchical hegemony where kings/nobles and religion used to be the guiding light of everyone's personal and professional life.\n\nThe benefits of post-industrialization period have come in precisely because we have moved on from a religio-centric to a reason-centric world. And these nitwits are trying to take us back to middle ages."
'I studied in a school run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, the principal there was the most gentle human I have ever seen. He was adored by everybody and it makes me sad to hear that you had such a principal as  a kid.'

( I know you're not bracketing them - but some people might start stereotyping based on your post)\n\nI've studied in a missionary school as well and we had some of the most wonderful teachers and Principals.\n\nSo there let's not make this a religion bashing thingy. \n\nIm not a pro religion guy by any means but that doesn't discount the fact that some of them ( people / institutions ) do good work."
"Didn't directly teach me, but was brilliant to have conversation with. He was involved in a lot of extra curriculars as well. Didn't know he was gay. Maybe we should get more gay people teaching. \n\nedit: a word."

"In a democracy, people are allowed to express their opinions on any topic that concerns them. It is also entirely possible to be concerned about more than one topic at a time. I'm sure that all of us here are capable of supporting both the LGBT cause, the dwindling workforce cause, and even other causes. "
"Oh, I don't know. The fact that these students are adults, deemed by the government to be capable of voting, driving, and paying income taxes? The fact that this isn't a school and you shouldn't be forced to show up for class in college.\n\nMany Indian parents have trouble with the idea of giving their children independence and won't teach them personal responsibility. But that doesn't mean colleges have to indulge the parents' attitude of stifling their children's personal growth."
"You might not find anything wrong, but I'm sure the adult students are in disfavour."
"As a former student of his, I can assure you he doesn't care much about the cash or the job. He really, really cares about teaching though. One of the best professors I have ever had (and I have been taught by some of the best professors in this country)."

'That is not the context. The context for update #2 is this response that the guy made to the one you posted. \nThis is it word for word:\n" There seems to be a trend being spread by the likes of The New Indian Express, The Times of India and The Hindu (surprisingly) that a certain professor was sacked from St. Joseph\'s College on grounds of being a homosexual.\n\nTo start off, this is complete hogwash, untrue and a biased opinion likely leaked to the press by the affected individual in question.\n\nThe articles are vague when it comes to counter claims made by the college and the individuals who were responsible in the hiring of said individual. This shows a complete lack of investigative journalism on the parts of the above media firms, apart from their inability to find interesting things to write about.\n\nDo not spread information that isn\'t verified by sources other than the one who is afflicted. Allow me to tell you why:\n\nThe English Department and the Institution of St. Joseph\'s regularly organise talks by notable transgender people like Akkai Padmashali and have other openly gay and qualified individuals who are social and legal activists, lecture and conduct talks on the college premesis.\n\nThe termination of the former teacher in question, was strictly not on grounds of homosexuality but rather because of the way said person conducted himself, treated other individuals who are employed in the institution and the way he behaved with students, much younger than him in terms of age. \n\nAnd I\'ll tell you this much, the individual in question was very aware of my knowledge about his past and not once, being a professor in my class, not once did he engage in a conversation with me let alone even make eye contact. And I happen to sit in the front bench every single class.\n\nPlease get your facts right and consider the damages that can be created without an informed and with a doctored opinion.\n\nAnyone who attempts to defame my department will have to go through me, and believe me my words aren\'t all you\'ll have to contend with. \n\nThe English Department of St. Joseph\'s College is the most liberal, well informed, politically active, center and left wing organisation I know, to date. I deplore any outsiders who haven\'t experienced it and say otherwise in a phoney attempt to create sensational news.\n\nWhile there are other issues which St. Joseph\'s College can be questioned about, being homophobic is not one of them. It\'s actually a remarkable fact and applaudable that a religious institution is so encouraging of alternate lifestyles and worldviews.\n\nI get that Modi hasn\'t done anything stupid in almost a month, but that\'s no excuse to fill pages with grandoise lies of someone who happens to have press connections. He isn\'t the only one who does.\n\nWhile I admire the individuals\' tenacity to write an open letter in which he lists many of the problems students and staff of St. Joseph\'s face under the administration, he had no right to use them in defense of his termination, which he feels was unfair. This is my response to his silly open letter (If anyone knows where he\'s posted it, please share this with him); \n\n"Your open letter does not justify your actions against students 15-20 years younger than you, it does not justify your brashness and the pitiable language which you feel you merit by your educational qualifications, it does not justify your overt and open sex obsession(s), it does not justify your incapability of holding a job and it does not justify your open abandoning of your guidees and the class you were assigned to because they complained that you are creepily sexual with them and interfered with their private lives. You are wrong in your admonishing of the institution that hired you knowing full well you were gay as well as sacked in the past for similar conduct and then finally sacking you because of your unchanging abhorrent behaviour. People like you are the reason why the LGBT community is misunderstood. Stop your heehawing and grow up."\n\nPlease share this post so that the truth is made visible from under the blanket of lies this individual has shabbily woven. Thank you."'

'I can venture a guess as to why this happens. It\'s not that we\'re inherently bad people or anything. \n\nMost Indians don\'t pay direct income taxes (for obvious reasons of course, that\'s why I propose that we make every Indian regardless of age, outside the tax net pay a tax, even if it is ₹10 a year). Because of this, a large group of people don\'t feel a sense of ownership when it comes to government property. The feeling that this is "our" money which has been put to good use, is entire lacking in a large section of the populace, which is no surprise because a lot of them don\'t pay direct taxes at all.\n\nAdd to that the nepotism and haughtiness of our politicians, and you have the perfect recipe for a large section of citizens to feel alienated from the government. Although I believe in free markets, I think in certain circumstances, it\'s important for people to feel an attachment to certain government properties and institutions (and not necessarily the government) more than private ones.'

There was lot of outrage when the Govt. first introduced it, but it was forced, so everyone had to accept it. People were already of the mindset to litter the streets and public places without facing action, so now they thought, "I\'m paying an extra cess, why do I need to pick up my own shit ?" A friend who is a staunch BJP supporter, once tried to throw garbage from a moving car. The govt. can only do so much. If there isn\'t a dustbin nearby, pack the litter and throw it when you see one. If you are using a public toilet, flush it so that the next person can use it.

I considered flicking it for a moment. Guess same goes with people in that train. First time. \n\nAlso, we have two Indias. People like us for whom those low quality headphones and cheap led screens are already passé. And those who buy A/c class tickets only once in their lives for the experience. The problem is that government services can't be designed to be used only for one India and not the other.  So either we keep the quality low uniformly or we experiment, educate and let such losses not dampen the spirit. "

One nation, One law, One tax. India is dozen nations within itself that can merrily coexist. No need to mess with it. If only Indian institutions were strong and independent, probably UCC might have been success. This will just be a tool for majority assertion on minority. Christians are any ways being targeted increasingly all over. It's just they are too small in number so it rarely makes to news.\n\n>UCC may rile muslims, sikhs and other minorities. In an age where India should focus on labour reforms, job creation, making Indian youngsters skilled to take work - UCC is a tool from govt to escape from it's apparent failures. You would not want internal disturbances and business turning away from India at the cost of UCC.\n\n>Bear in mind overwhelming muslims fall in same income bracket, prosperity zone as SC's or Dalits.

'Didn\'t they represent in court that they are against triple talaq?\n\n[Source](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/triple-talaq-not-case-of-majority-vs-minority-centre-to-supreme-court-after-kapil-sibals-all-india-m-1694770)\n\n> Making its strongest pitch against triple talaq in the Supreme Court, the Centre on Wednesday brushed aside the argument that triple talaq should be allowed because it had been in practice for centuries. The Centre\'s top law officer Mukul Rohatgi said instant divorce was certainly not an essential part of Islam and it could not be allowed to continue by the court,\xa0just because it had been in practice for 1,400 years.\n\n> "Can anyone say that we allow human sacrifice just because it was practised earlier," Mr Rohatgi argued before the country\'s five top judges hearing the triple talaq case.\n\n\n> Attorney General Rohatgi rejected suggestions, also from Mr Kapil Sibal, that the court should adopt a hands-off approach because enacting a law would amount to the majority community forcing its views on the minority community.\n\n> "It is not a majority versus minority issue.... It is a tussle between haves and have-nots within the system. It is intra-community struggle between men and women because men are more resourceful, earner and educated," he said, pleading with the top court to put a final end to the practice that the court too had called\xa0the "worst form" of dissolution of marriage.\n\n> The Supreme Court must step in and remove triple talaq," Mr Rohatgi said, going on to elaborate that old practices among Hindus such as Sati and untouchability had also been outlawed. But the court promptly shot back: "All these issues were addressed by the legislature which removed it. If we (court) enter, you will say the judiciary usurped powers of the legislature."\n\n> The constitution bench comprising\xa0five judges, all of different faiths, started daily hearings of the triple talaq case last week after the courts closed for summer vacations. The judges said they would determine if triple talaq, the practice of Muslim men getting instant divorce by saying "talaq" three times, was fundamental to religion. They had, however, indicated that they would not rule on polygamy among Muslims.\n\n> One of the strongest votary of continuing with the practice has been the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) represented by Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who had called triple talaq a matter of faith that had been practised for 1,400 years. "Who are we to say that this is un-Islamic," he had asked. In an attempt to link the practice to religion, he added that the source of triple talaq can be found in Hadith and it came into being after the time of Prophet Muhammad.\n\n> Much of Mr Rohatgi\'s focus today was to rebut such arguments, trying to delink the practice from Islam and insisting that it had to pass the constitutional test of right to equality for women. The top law officer said religion was protected under the right to religion, not religious practices. In any case, he said,\xa0the right to religion was not absolute.\n'
"> the PM came forward and said that Muslims have to resolve the issue among themselves.\n\nDouble speak is the name of the game in today's politics, everyone does it. I think muslims will support BJP and vote for them only as long as they don't interfere in their way of life. Whatever we debate about the rights and wrongs here, at the end of the day, a politician is only interested in votes (just as a businessman is more interested in money, rather than business ethics or professionalism).\n\nSo, it all depends on what BJP thinks the majority or average muslim in the country wants. And to be honest, we have a good mix of both modern muslims who don't support triple talaq, and also conservative muslims who actually want triple talaq to stay. So, in order to get the support of maximum populace, the BJP will support the majority's cause. They might also try and send mix signals - so the urban or well educated muslim gets the message that they are abolishing TT, whereas the rural conservative mindset muslim understands that they'd allow the old ways to continue. Ultimately, vote maximization is what they are interested in.\n\nIf you were the politician, what you would have done? Just ensure that you are supporting the cause of the majority of the populace, right? (as long as its not a national security issue or something)."
'According to Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, personal religious inclinations was not considered in the matters of the state. If you want to practice pure religion, step down from the throne and pursue accordingly. That was how the 3 generations of Mauryan dynasty went.

'Yes, indeed. But it is fair enough to start from Laws like polygamy and triple talaq, that are reasons for oppression of human rights.\n\n'

'That doesn\'t mean resolve the issue among themselves (muslims). In fact, his [actual words](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/dont-allow-issue-to-be-politicised-enlightened-muslims-will-lead-fight-against-triple-talaq-says-pm-narendra-modi-4633739/) are below and Modi also asked for more participation from muslim community. \n\n>  Modi said: “Teen talaq ko lekar aaj yeh ek bahut badi behes chal rahi hai. Bharat ke mahan parampara ko dekhte hue, mere bheetar ek aasha ka sanchaar ho raha hai… ki is desh me samaj ke bheetar se hi taqatwar log nikalte hain, jo paramparon ko todte hain, nasht karte hain, aadhunik vyavasthaon ko viksit karte hain… Musalman samaj mein se bhi aise prabuddh log paida honge, aage aayenge, aur Muslim betiyon ko, unke saath jo gujar rahi hai, jo beet rahi hai, unke khilaf wo khud ladai ladenge, aur kabhi na kabhi raasta nikalenge.”(“There is a debate about triple talaq. **Looking at the great traditions of our nation, a hope is rising within me**… that powerful people will emerge from within the community who will break the traditions, demolish them and develop a modern system… Enlightened people from within the Muslim community will emerge and come forward to fight against all that Muslim daughters have to undergo… They will find a way out.”)\n\nThe supreme Court set up bench to hear triple talaq on Feb 16, 2017. In the court, the government has represented that "practices of triple talaq, nikah halala and polygamy impact the social status and dignity of Muslim women and deny them fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution." and that they would bring in [legislation if the SC bans(rules it unconstitutional) triple talaq](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/triple-talaq-sc-says-cant-hear-nikah-halala-polygamy-have-limited-time/). Even in the independence day speech, Modi referred to triple talaq issue and voiced support for the women suffering because of triple talaq.\n\nIn fact, it is the [congress which is telling BJP to let muslims solve the problem themselves and not to bring it to court](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/muslims-can-solve-triple-talaq-issue-by-their-own-says-digvijay-singh-117041700284_1.html).'
'No, you should always care about what the agenda is, whether it is any political party and their decisions. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.'
"Loopholes aren't ant-constitutional par se. I think the Finance Bill changes are justified, and will enable transitioning political contributions away from black money generation."
"there is a difference, a huge one. Congress is built from ground up, nepotism, family control etc yes but still from ground up. They too have ministers who take funding from corporates and siphon large amounts of public money. But the reason they get elected is not because some big crorepati has paid a lot of people to give whatsapp forwards or publish news favoring them. Its because of dada giri at the ground level and a lot of greedy public which elects them for getting benefit of one scheme or another. BJP on the other hand follows the top down model. Its entire basis is corporate funding, it can exist without a lot of leaders and even without a lot its cabinet ministers. But it will cease to function when corporates don't fund it or when corporate funding becomes illegal. It won't be wrong to call BJP, the political department of a specific company. In fact that is the reason why many of the congress gaffe's come out as *scams* but BJP's day light robbery will be hidden from public view. That is also the reason why media campaigns and bad publicity can bring down the congress govt but not affect the BJP in any way at all."
"I don't quite agree. What I meant was that although it might be that BJP (or RSS, whatever) supports UCC more because they get to attack Muslims and please their fan base, they will still have my support simply because I view *Triple Talaq*, *Nikah Halala* and *Polygyny* as a socially regressive and sexist practice.\n\nThey might have a different motives and implementing UCC will probably pleasure them in some different way, but if the outcome is same then that's what it really matters."
'I agree with that! One should always care about what the ultimate agenda is. But you\'re missing the point when you use "the road to hell is paved with good intention" what it means that you\'ve sat on good intention,without taking any definitive steps. Just having good intention without doing anything won\'t take you to heaven.\nThe best that can be said about government\'s opposition to triple talak is that it is genuinely concerned about the welfare of Muslim women, genuinely concerned about human rights. The worst that can be said about the government\'s stand is that BJP has an ulterior motive to bag the muslims women\'s votes by doin something for them.'

O slayer of Madhu, who else is there than thee, who regarding himself a man would say in the midst of respectable men that his wife had been intended for some body else? O Krishna, pardon me if thou pleasest, or pardon me not. But angry or friendly, what canst thou do unto me?\'\n\n>"And while Sisupala was speaking thus, the exalted slayer of Madhu thought in his mind of the discus that humbleth the pride of the Asuras. And as soon as the discus came into his hands, skilled in speech the illustrious one loudly uttered these words,--\'Listen ye lords of earth, why this one had hitherto been pardoned by me. As asked by his mother, a hundred offences (of his) were to be pardoned by me. Even this was the boon she had asked, and even this I granted her. That number, ye kings, hath become full. I shall now slay him in your presence, ye monarchs.\' \n\n>Having said this, the chief of the Yadus, that slayer of all foes, in anger, instantly cut off the head of the ruler of Chedi by means of his discus.

"**Religion should be confined to museums, says Javed Akhtar**\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/03/javed-akhtar-480.jpg?w=480)\n\n___\n\nLyricist and Rajya Sabha MP Javed Akhtar. (File Photo) Lyricist and Rajya Sabha MP Javed Akhtar. (File Photo)\n\nRenowned writer and lyricist Javed Akhtar hinted at the growing intolerance within the society, where any criticism against the Prime Minister’s policies invite the tag of “anti-national”.\n\n“In the past, humour against a Prime Minister was passable. But today, if you criticise the Prime Minister’s policies it is deemed as anti-national,” he said. Attending the Loksatta Gappa (interaction) on Saturday, Akhtar held a freewheeling discussion on wide-ranging subjects — from society to politics and religion. Noted actor and poet Kishore Kadam (Soumitra) anchored the discussion and asked various questions that unveiled Akhtar’s versatile personality.\n\n\n\nWatch What Else Is Making News\n\nFaith and belief are two different things. What can be substantiated is belief. Whereas, it is difficult to prove or establish the matters of faith. The premises of religion is founded on faith, which cannot be ascertained or substantiated. And it is a matter of individual’s faith. Therefore, we must have religion. But it should be confined to a museum — these were some of the assertions by Akhtar.\n\nKnown for his progressive work and outlook in public life and Bollywood, where he has served for more than 50 years, first question to Akhtar was: should there be religion?\n\nLetting out a smile and gazing at the audience, Akhkar said, “Religion should be there definitely. But it should be in the museum.” Taking the discussion to higher levels, he said, “Atrocities against women are often defined as ‘family honour’. When nations engage in war for oil, we describe it as ‘war on terror’. We undermine the pains of privatisation by calling it liberalisation. Similarly, religion often plays a significant role in covering up many intolerant aspects of the society.”\n\nResponding to a question on whether there has been a rise in intolerance in the society, he said, “It is not as if everything has gone wrong now or everything is getting right now. But today, if we were to enact the episode of Mahabharata as shown in the film Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, it would lead to protest.” “In the past, humour against a Prime Minister was passable. But now if we criticise the policies of the present Prime Minister, it would perceived as anti-national,” he added. Reflecting on the ongoing changes in the society and politics, he also expressed his views on Uniform Civil Code and Bollywood item songs. Throughout the discussion, Akhtar regaled the audience with his unique wit and humour.\n\nThe Loksatta Gappa is organised by popular Marathi daily Loksatta, which is a part of the Indian Express Group.

'Love Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi for speaking out their minds without taking any political sides. We need more celebrities like them.\n\nI remember sometime back he criticized some Hindu tradition, and Kulcha friends of mine immediately branded him a "Muslim Agent" or some such shit. Then I pointed out that not only is he an Atheist, he also runs charities to support Ex-Muslims abroad. '
'I disagree in reality but I appreciate the sentiment. I would rather support is a drastic reformation of religion. '
"You, Sir, have my utmost respect. As an atheist in India, who would have to fear for his life on expressing such a remark in public, you've done a great service to me. Thank you, Sir."
"So brave!!!1 \n\nBut seriously, religion is fine and dandy as long as it does not interfere with others' freedom. Also, it has no place in the ruling of a country. "
'What is his Reddit ID? \n\nI am sure he visits r/India often...'
'Not all beliefs are equally defensible. '
"Museum is the window to the past and what better way to teach/inform people about the things that religion has done from it's inception in the name of their God. The people who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it therefore everyone should know about the Conquests, Jihad, Caste, Communism, Nazis etc."
'Not unintelligent. But dicks... On high horses '
"Don't you know? We on Reddit are very smart and intelligent. We can even speak English! We're so far ahead of the mango Indian in our sophistication and liberal outlook that's make Tagore and Raja Ram Mohan Roy look like conservative barbarians. "

'Was it the same clowns that wanted the anthem to be played before "Laila maal ba chaila kamaal ba"?'
'Apparently its more important to teach nationalism to people going to movies than at courts.'
'Oh, cool! Do as I say, not as I do.'
'In other news, the SC just furthered its own moral and intellectual decline. Its authority, such as it was, is now even more of a laughable joke. \n\nThis is actually significant. Nobody is going to take these morons seriously anymore. Why would they? The level of hypocrisy has gutted them. '
'I think if someone is going to Supreme court for hearing then they need to carry their mobile and a bluetooth speaker and before the proceedings starts one should play the National Anthem so that all of them even the judges should stand in the court. '
'Korean Air Lines flight KE007 was shot down by Soviet fighter-jets on September 1, 1983. On that fateful night, 240 unsuspecting passengers and crew members were shot down like an innocent sparrow in flight. The trigger-man for the Soviet Union was Major Osipovich, a pilot who wasn’t originally scheduled to be in the air during this international travesty.\n\nThe Major was slated to give a talk about peace at his daughter’s school so he volunteered for night duty to free up enough time to speak during school hours. This adjustment in flight time put him in the position of patrolling the eastern skies when that Korean passenger-jet strayed into Soviet air space. In the end, Major Osipovich followed orders and shot down the commercial airliner. How tragic that 240 lives were lost, and world powers were pushed dangerously close to catastrophic results because military missiles were fired at a civilian airplane by a pilot who was preparing to teach children about peace. \n\nCharacter can only be supported by actions, not merely words.'
'Thank you, "Supreme Court". You have lost whatever little faith I had left in you. What a bunch of fucking hypocrites.\n\nIf the highest legal institution of this country has become so laughably crap, no wonder our once-glorious nation is slowly going down the drain.'
'Given that this decision of the Supreme Court of India can be interpreted as an active violation of the "The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971", the judges should find themselves guilty, and ban the Supreme Court.'

'This is sensible on part of court -- imposing nationalism on people does not create the inherent love which they should have anyway for the country.\n'
'Why is the Supreme Court acting like this? There must be more to the story right? How can the SC be so immature'
'Why am i not surprised by the supremely corrupt organization'
'Supreme court bench members are so patriotic that they sing the national anthem when they orgasm.. \n\nListening to it at work will give them an awkward boner.. '
"I think the SC order was pointless and regressive, but playing Devil's advocate the two are different cases. One is related to the workplace and the other to entertainment. \n\nSupreme Court judges are not exempting themselves; they would also have to stand for the national anthem when they go to movie theaters with their families."
'Just wondering - if someone plays the national anthem on his cell in a movie theater, is everyone required to immediately stand up and show respect? What if a student plays it in a class or say I play it in the middle of a job interview? '
'Ah, glorious Bhojpuri movie titles...'
'I say a law should be passed making all ATMs sing. Instead of the lady saying useless things like *Please insert your card, please enter your pin* etc, she rather use her melodious voice to sing our glorious national anthem. '
'I know you are joking but when exactly will it play? Queues will not be there always. Will it play as soon as >5 people line up? Is there technology for that.'
'Supreme Chutiyas.\n\nVary naice.'
'Woaah, thanks for clearing up the air. It would also help if you elaborate for plebs on the why a petition is required amongst other things like ELI5.'
'Who cares what Britons do though? They were a mess of a country since past 800 years in terms of human rights, massacring French and Irish and Scottish people at every chance...and their shitty atrocious tendencies were let loose on shameful levels in their brief period of world domination. They have always been like that, although staying in EU meant decent, more civilized countries kept their wild urges on a leash. Now that the EU restriction is gone, they are back where they always were.\n\nOn the other hand in India, we actually used to have a great Supreme court in the past. And politicians right after independence were decent too. Today, however, politicians with even a sanity of a 3 year old are non-existent here, and Supreme court has turned to shit.\n\nI wonder how long such things will go on.'
'You will happily sell us for mere 50 bucks.'
'Or his movies to be played before the national anthem.'
'Sahi baat hai. Hum toh chutiye hai ki national anthem gayenge. SC has better things to do. '
"You can not do that, afaik. Playing it without announcing isn't allowed. "
'I will ask better what if- someone plays it when the court proceedings are on'
'True Kulcha.'
"You missed the point being conveyed. \n\nIn the end, the pilot would be remembered for his action of having shot down the plane rather than his noble thought of giving a peace talk at his daughter's school.\n\nSame goes with SC, yeah you gave orders to uphold Patriotic feelings (assuming best case scenario) but when you don't follow it up with actions yourself, its a futile exercise.\n\nCharacter can only be supported by actions, not merely words."
"So you're ridding us of our happy high on SC's hypocrisy that technically doesn't exist?\n\nFUCK YOU REALITY-MAN!"
"Step 1: Enter Justice Mishra's court                                        \nStep 2: Stand up and shout: Please stand for the national anthem.                    \nStep 3: Play the National Anthem on 10 hour loop.                          \nResult: Watch the Supreme Court Justice's stand for 10 hours."
'PSA. All those who sat while reading this, get ready to get arrested.'
'Scanning the comments, all my stereotypes proved to be correct. The defensive and passive-aggressive tone is flowing. OP definitely hit a nerve. '
"Have the exact same thoughts on r/India, the conduct of most of the people is plain disgusting. They have no other work than berating India and certain states like Bihar specially. I am not from Bihar but seriously it feels irritating now. Every single place may not be that developed and prospering but people do have sentiments and attachments with wherever they are from. Being a bit more civil and respectful won't hurt. A line needs to be drawn. Just because it's social media, that doesn't mean one can say anything. Just my personal thoughts, anyone is free to disagree. "
"It doesn't matter OP. To each his own. He says it like he sees it.  \n\nBut if he is directing it at you and you want some reprieve ask him why Indians are getting shot in US and does he really feel safe there. Tell him that everyone you are meeting is scared and is contemplating of going back. Would be fun. "
"OP macha,\n\nInstead of ranting about this on Randia where you will invite only circlejerking from both sides of the spectrum, why don't you just tell your client exactly what you think?\n\nIf he expects you to listen to his views on what is wrong with the country he chose to leave behind, I am sure you can expect him to hear your views on what you think of people like him.\n\nIF you are afraid of telling your client this directly, then it makes you as much a hypocrite as you accuse him of being.\n\nP.S: I mostly agree with your opinion."
'Well they are hunting them down....one at a time.'
"I have not exclusively met indians who have up Indian citizenship, but met those who didn't and all of them unanimously agreed that India can offer better life if you have more money in India. A lot of them are simply trying to accumulate more money in hopes of comfortablr life back home.\n\nSo that does not represent the whole bunch for sure."
"Aarey, chhodo. Let it go.\n\nDon't worry about the worries and points of view of other people. Listen, for what it's worth, and move on. He may have issues with india but, honestly, who doesn't? It's all about a cost-benefit analysis and what works for you. If India doesn't work for you, then leave and find a place that does. If india works for you, then great, you've found home."
'You are bang on OP! And the fake accent thing is just so true (check for e.g. Sunil Khilnani among many others). These guys are in a shithole with being half-Indian, half-American -- trying to be American but facing obstacles due to their ingrained Indian identity. Ha! Haha! Hahaha! Hahahaha!'
'Lol. Wrong place buddy. Most of the people here are like that only.\n\nBe the change you want to see, not just cry about it. Hope those rednecks will get these things in their minds.'
'Some observations on the extreme behavior on both sides of the spectrum.\n\nYes, lots of NRIs unfortunately have this superior snobbish attitude towards India. I find it especially shameful when they bring this up at every chance, especially in front of other goras. Like wtf dude, even if you have issues, keep them to yourself. Have some pride about your roots as well. And don\'t open your kimono at every chance. People have issues with their family life too. Doesn\'t mean they berate their spouses at every given chance for everyone to hear.\n\nFor what it is worth, i find this attitude less and less in the more recent immigrants. In fact, the newer immigrants, especially those who have lived in big Indian cities in the last few years, tend to have a fairly balanced perspective. Idk what the reason is with the older immigrants is, maybe they have an outdated notion of what India really is, or have brainwashed themselves.\n\nBut to call a spade a spade, the reverse is equally true. Even OP posted about NRIs having fake accents. Dude, that is not a fake accent. That is people trying to adopt aspects of a different culture. And people trying to talk more like the way locals talk so they can communicate more effectively.\n\nIf you are going to call that out, you are no better than the comedy shows that make caricatures of madrasis and sardars and use their accents to get some cheap laughs. Fake accent is when you have snooty college kids who develop an American accent based solely on movies and TV shows while never having been to America.\n\nAnd in India, corporate life has its own set of problems and biases hidden under the chaddi. In most larger IT organizations, i find extreme levels of groupism and regionalism. If you happen to work in Hyderabad or Pune for exampele, everyone will keep talking in Telugu or Marathi even when they know there are others who do not understand. And if you are an outsider, you will indeed find your career growth much slower and find yourself being "out of the loop".\n\nSo calling a spade a spade, OP in the process of (rightfully) calling the NRIs holier than thou, is ironically being holier than thou himself. Which is also you see this thread rapidly devolving into two camps, two circlejerks if you will.\n\nLet us just stop doing this. Seriously. This is a complex subject and honestly, we suck at it. All of us. In any crowd, Indians are the only ones who will "anjaan maro" when they see another Indian. And god forbid, if a random Indian girl sees you on the street (in another country) when walking. She will deliberately turn her head as far away from you as possible, to avoid the fleeting chance of eye contact or something.\n\nLet\'s just have quiet pride about our roots and our country and our culture, but let us also have quiet shame about how we also treat each other badly and about how biased we are. And let\'s just try to improve ourselves instead of just pointing fingers. Leading by example is almost always the best way to effect change.\n\nI realize this ended up being a bit preachy and for that, i apologize. My intention was not that. '
'My dad used to call them Donuts brown on the outside, more white inside. Best case try and avoid these individuals as they have a fixed agenda in their heads and rarely can be convinced otherwise. \n\nMore difficult for these folks sometimes is to admit that India does have its advantages and use the existing social/economics reasons to justify their attitude.\n\nOP only advice, if you are in a office setting, document everything if anything serious is directed towards you. You need proof to HR /company representative if anything untoward happens '
'OP - You do this.\n\nBeat the shit out of him and make this bastard chant "Bharat mata ki jai"\n\nHow dare he talk shit about world\'s best country - certified by UNSECO !!'
"Let's suppose a guy from South India moves to Delhi and he has thick South Indian accent when he communicates in Hindi. Now after living in Delhi for many years, if he still speaks Hindi like he just came from South India, then either he has only been living in South Indian community or hasn't really tried to assimilate. \n**I get that you're angry at some douchebag talking shit about India, but don't make accent a reason for your hate.** Don't hate on Indians who have been living in US/UK for years and their accents have changed for better.  \nI really don't get why many Indians are so adamant that anyone who was born in India must speak with Indian accent for his entire life. "
"They gave up their citizenship for their career. If they had the choice of dual citizenship I'm sure most of them would have taken it.\n\nThese people are still Indians with family and cultural ties to India, so why shouldn't they be concerned about what happens here?"

"Can we get tax-payers money back for IIT's if the graduate emigrates from India?Not hating but they took the money away and are not contributing it back.Would save alot of money."
"It's a free country. Say what you want, believe what you want to believe. \n\nAlso, there's a ton of things wrong with India. Can't a man complain if he has chosen to emigrate? What kind of logic is that?"
'Lol, I hear you! And apologies in advance, if this sounds like some long winded rant/"gyan" - I just needed to get it off my chest too :-D. Here it comes...\n\nGet used to hearing that kind of talk from a majority of long-time immigrants in the US, if you have any intentions of staying here for a while without being irritated. He\'s just exhibiting normal behaviour of digging for validation of his decision of buying into "the dream", by trying get you to want what he has (... while alluding that you can have it too, if you pay your "dues"). They just love hearing people taking a shit on their home country and culture.\n\nMay be he really had experienced bad times back home and may be he really means well, but it\'s usually just that misery loves company. It\'s just that it\'s a commonly used way of finding a support group for appropriating one\'s own living like a refugee (obviously I\'m exaggerating a little when I say \'refugee\', but he\'s probably missing life/culture in India badly). They all just regurgitate the same \'nation of immigrants\' propaganda over and over again - it\'s always the same old ponzi scheme. \n\nIMO, the real problem is that many continue to buy into it. But, when you\'ve debated long enough and all else fails, what it boils down to as I\'ve observed, i.e., the lowest common denominator (at least for Indians who still have connections to India via family/property/investments/loans), is the foreign exchange rate. If not for which, a whole lot would move back very quickly. It\'s not as much about the clean air, "no corruption", etc., as much as it is about the money that they can get to save and send back (for investments or otherwise) with a big multiplying factor. The "clean air, no corruption" is just the broken tape recorder that they keep playing to help them "keep on keeping on", while they do their money thing.\n\nI\'m not in any way saying America is a terrible place to live (it\'s actually ok); just saying there are pros and cons, and IMO the pros and cons are mostly related to the abundance of natural resources as opposed to the inherent quality/soundness of the government/system. In other words, if the system screws up in America, there\'s usually so much more room for error, than in India (e.g., India has 4 times the population and 1/3 the land). The magnitude of the organizational challenges will always be higher in India due to the much greater population-density, but fortunately given the direction we\'re heading in, so also will the magnitude of opportunities be greater due to the potential size of our economy. Hopefully, starting soon enough we\'ll not have to keep listening to these Bobby Jindal types.'
'If what he is saying is correct, then you better digest it. '
'Criticise the country he loves. Nitpick and then keep on drilling on those points.\n\nEdit: Or tell him that he was born in this country, and hence should feel lucky. Butterfly effect, and he could have been born in Iraq, Syria, Somalia or a village in Africa asking for Facebook likes. '

'> How would you like it if a foreigner even after living in India for a long time speaks pronounces "Himalaya" as "Himulya" even after hearing it day in and day out?\n\nI don\'t think anybody in India would lose their shit over it. We realize that he will have a hard time correctly pronouncing certain words because he is not a native and we can live by that. \n\nI have been living outside India since 2008 and I am happy to say that I haven\'t developed an accent. I still speak English like the way I used to back in 2008. Yes, I do get the "pardon me" and "could you say that again" and I oblige. I do the same thing too when I don\'t understand what they are saying and nobody here gets pissed off because they have to repeat whatever they said.'

The oppressors are vanniyars who are themselves  landless labor community, after their tree-felling agitation(their caste job) across the state they got themselves MBC status ! apparently, their most backward status takes a leave whenever they want to establish their supremacy over dalits. \n\n\nIn another similar incident, in TN, the festivities in this village was cancelled after a clash between dalits and an OBC community.The issue was sorted out after the dalits threatened to [convert to Islam](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/Dalits-of-Pazhag-Kallimedu-threaten-to-embrace-Islam/article14513106.ece).\n\nyour village is not an exception.

"Bhai - you should create a throwaway account and put the actual name of the temple here. Otherwise it's just another unverified account on the internet.

There's a lot of people in India, and we love bribing. God is our favourite bribee."
'Is the temple public property? If it is, then Article 15 applies. If it is private property, they can do whatever they want. \n\nSidenote: Temples are not magical places, nobody should be encouraged to visit there or donate money to false gods. If someone is denied admission, they are better off, because nothing magical happens at temples, they have no special powers. To base an argument on admission to temples is in itself an exercise in degeneracy. \n\nWe are effectively saying that people who believe in the magical powers of a temple devoted to a half man, half monkey who flew around carrying a mountain, should be thought policed over discriminating against others who want to donate money in the name of this divine entity. If we are to thought police at all, discrimination is the least objectionable thought in this spaghetti of nonsense.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this only really becomes a debatable issue at all if the temple is private property. If it is public property then the law is pretty clear, everyone is allowed, and if disallowed, can seek relief from a court. '

'Race is a social construct. Caste is one that plays a very similar role. This is just being nitpicky.'
">There is something in caste, so far as it means blood; such a thing as heredity there is, certainly. Now try to [understand] — why do you not mix your blood with the Negroes, the American Indians? Nature will not allow you. Nature does not allow you to mix your blood with them. There is the unconscious working that saves the race. That was the Aryan's caste. Mind you, I do not say that they are not equal to us. They must have the same privileges and advantages, and everything; but we know that if certain races mix up, they become degraded. With all the strict caste of the Aryan and non-Aryan, that wall was thrown down to a certain extent, and hordes of these outlandish races came in with all their queer superstitions and manners and customs. Think of this: not decency enough to wear clothes, eating carrion, etc. But behind him came his fetish, his human sacrifice, his superstition, his diabolism. He kept it behind, [he remained] decent for a few years. After that he brought all [these] things out in front. And that was degrading to the whole race. And then the blood mixed; [intermarriages] took place with all sorts of unmixable races. The race fell down. But, in the long run it proved good. If you mix up with Negroes and American Indians, surely this civilisation will fall down. But hundreds and hundreds years after, out of this mixture will come a gigantic race once more, stronger than ever; but, for the time being, you have to suffer. The Hindus believe — that is a peculiar belief, I think; and I do not know, I have nothing to say to the contrary, I have not found anything to the contrary — they believe there was only one civilised race: the Aryan. Until he gives his blood, no other race can be civilised. No teaching will do. The Aryan gives his blood to a race, and then it becomes civilised. Teaching alone will not do. He would be an example in your country: would you give your blood to the Negro race? Then he would get higher culture.\n\n>The Hindu loves caste. I may have little taint of that superstition — I do not know. I love the Master's ideal. Great! But, for me, I do not think that the working was very practical; and that was one of the great causes that led to the downfall of the Indian nation, in the long run. But then it brought about this tremendous fusion. Where so many different races are all fusing, mingling — one man white like you, or yellow, while another man as black as I am, and all grades between these two extremes, and each race keeping their customs, manners, and everything — in the long run a fusion is taking place, and out of this fusion surely will come a tremendous upheaval; but, for the time being, the giant must sleep. That is the effect of all such fusion."

It is also why reservations are such a RSS supporters (mostly upper caste or people who are from urban populations) go to cause, as it is a pretty simple way to uplift those traumatized communities.\n\nIts a sophisticated form of slavery, you see we indians are so much better and intellectual that we built slavery right into our belief system, and heres the best part- even if you dont follow the caste system or believe in it you still will be treated as your Imagined caste as most of the government servants, judges, corporations, etc are run by upper castes.'

Ever since BJP has come, we could see the uprising of right wing trolls, Hindus-playing-victim-card, Hindu Rashtra, and a lot of bullshits. BJP supporters think anyone who isn't a rabid nationalist is an anti-national. Supporting the soliders and respecting the cows have become a necessary trait for someone to be an Indian. I just can't. Bhakts are the people who want war with Pakistan, and are agains those who want peace with neighboring nations; yet, when soliders get killed in the war, Bhakts blame liberals for wanting peace with those nations, as if liberals had wanted war. Right wing channels like Republic, Times now, are feeding those Bhakts with the news they want to see. Sad state of affairs."

This is not the first time.” (Source: ANI photo) Amit Shah said, “In a big country like India, there have been many such incidents in the past. This is not the first time.” (Source: ANI photo)\n\nBJP chief Amit Shah on Monday rejected the Congress’s demand for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation over the Gorakhpur hospital tragedy, saying incidents like these happen in a big country like India. “Congress ka kaam hai isteefa maangna. Itne bade desh mein bahut saare haadse hue, pehli baar aisa haadsa nahi hua hai. (It is Congress’s job to ask for resignation. In a big country like India, there have been many such incidents in the past. This is not the first time),” said Shah. Over 70 children have died at BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, since August 7 allegedly over lack of oxygen supply. The National Human Rights Commission has sent a notice to the state government over the deaths.\n\nAdityanath, meanwhile, has ordered the state authorities to celebrate the festival of Krishna Janmashtami that falls on Tuesday in a “grand” way. In a communique issued late on Sunday to the Director General of Police (DGP) Sulkhan Singh, the CM has written: “Krishna Janmashtami is an important festival and the police should organise it in a traditional and grand way.”\n\nDefending Adityanath’s direction on Janmashthami celebrations, Shah said the festival is about people’s personal belief. “Janmashtami apni jagah hai, jaise desh mein hogi, waise UP mein logon ke personal belief ke aadhar par hogi, yeh govt festival nahi. (Janmashtami is at its own place. People of UP will also celebrate the way it will be celebrated in other states.

"Unpopular opinion here - while most of Saif's open letter was /r/cringe material, he is correct that the media (and by extension the people as media is only a mirror) rather than the industry should be blamed for nepotism. From the day these film kids are born, media shines the spotlight on them. \n\nAlmost every movie in India is successful because of the actors pulling power rather than the storyline or direction or performance. Producers such as Johar are smart and know this. So he does the smart thing and focuses on getting stars in his films instead of spending money on hiring good script writers or directors.\n\nLook at how much free publicity Bachchan Jr's first movie got. They were basically entire news primetime segments devoted to comparing his and his dad's dance steps to see the similarities. You can't write a script or perform to match something like that. "
"Amidst all this controversy, I'm finally happy that this issue is being talked about. All this time I used to cringe whenever a new movie starring some star kid used to premiere on Fridays.

"That's true. But my point was that if a star's son was genuinely talented and had the acting chops then he or she is as good as anyone else, even without any godfather in the industry. But the problem with nepotism in Bollywood is that talentless hacks keep trying over and over again even when they know that they lack talent, which blocks others from getting into the industry.\n\nLike for example: Ranbir Kapoor is a star's son but he's got the talent whereas Abhishek Bachchan, Uday Chopra, Sonam Kapoor have none of it and they are the biggest culprits who are hogging all the PR and films."
'Ranbir , yes.  '

"This will slowdown the new investment in the movie theathers.

"I don't know about TN industry, but there are many ways for people to make money in spite of price caps. \n\n- Reduce cost (remove luxury services and pricey options)\n- Offer additional product/services that aren't controlled by govt (food, beverages, parking, online/phone booking)\n- Turn theatre into TVs - Use your dedicated audiences to sell Ads and promotions. \n\nAlso, the theater business is investment intensive. Once you have put in money then it make sense to run it (even at small profit). But the price control will reduce future investments and growth.

'Hey OP, I collect artifacts from the time of Indian independence. Do you have any items from your dad related to Indian independence that you would wish to sell to a collector? I would be interested '
"Nice post, OP. These pics give a completely different perspective about the city to someone like me who considers Calcutta as his second mistress. \n\nNot much has changed though in all these years. All the buildings and business establishments in the pics still stand except Firpo's. Sealdah station and Esplanade/Chowringhee is dingier and dirtier than in these pics."

'Travelling in footboards.. cool since 1945!'
'OP. Thanks for these incredible pictures\n\nMy grandfather worked as an engineer for the Indian Railways in Calcutta from 1944 to 1947.\n\nHe was there during Direct Action Day and still tells me stories about how about how bad it was. \n\nWhen India got Independence, His superiors (a British Officer) finally had my Grandfather and his team escorted out of Calcutta by the Army as it felt like the riots were going to kick off again.\n\nHe saw these pictures and reminisced about the Grand Hotel and the Metro and a friend he lost during Direct Action Day.\n\nThank you for making his day - bringing back some good and some sad memories.'

"> I'm British, my father was in the British Army and posted to Kolkata between 1945 and 1947.\n\nI am curious as to what his perspective was of the British empire leaving India. Did he ever talk to you about it?"
"This is absolutely beautiful! I'm in Calcutta right now and looking at all these familiar places look surreal, especially since there are very few pictures remaining.\n\nAlso, Sealdah station has so become so much grungy and dirty these days."
'Can you please request your father to do an AMA ? Should be interesting. '
'This is amazing! Thank you so much for sharing.'
'Real treasure! Thanks a lot for sharing :)'
'Great idea'
"Nothing that would interest a collector, and to be honest nothing I would want to part with. All I have is his Dragoons cap badge, medals, national service card and a regimental Christmas card he sent home in 1946, and these photos. He was an ordinary private soldier so never collected anything unique or interesting. Also, I don't think those guys really knew they were living through history, so to speak. I would be fascinated to learn about your collection, though."
'Thanks for sharing that. Please say hello from me. Maybe you could help him do an AMA, that would be fantastic!'
"He talked a lot about India, but I don't think he had a perspective on the end of Empire, to be honest. He was an ordinary, working class man; and Welsh, not English. So - not do diminish the injustices of the Raj, but I think he seemed to come from the standpoint that the Empire was basically a mechanism for exploitation and we were better off without it. I never, ever heard him express any wistful regret for the loss of Empire. "
'Yeah seriously, this is a very fascinating snapshot into the past, especially for those of us with family from Calcutta. Cheers OP! '
"Not in Cal atm. But you can google. The only missing description of a building is in the 7th photo. That's the Grand hotel, now run by Oberoi hotels. "
"I would have loved to. But I don't have the now photos. Post to /r/kolkata  and maybe someone over there will. "
'Awesome. The Grand Hotel looks pretty damn magnificent. Metro Cinema has seen better days though...'

'No surprise. I\'ve come across my share of "senior" people in science,technology and education who happened to be religion/caste bigots. I wonder how they can apply critical thinking to their work without applying it to their own ideology. Also note that some of these people simply reached their positions because their parents had money and the competition was nowhere close to what we have today. Hence it was relatively easier to get a good job if you were rich enough to have access to education. That said, people should have the freedom to believe in whatever they want .Ideology should be as personal as underwear. We don\'t fly our underwear on a flag to influence or oppress people.

"That's a really good reason to have anonymous contributions. This is the only time on this sub I have seen a logical answer whenever the question is asked. "
'there is actually a solution to that - public funding of political parties. A public fund can be set up to be managed by the govt or may be even specifically EC, which gives out money to individual parties. if a person or entity wants to make anonymous donations, they can only do so to this public fund. A person or entity can donate to individual parties, but that cannot be anonymous.\n\nThe percentage each party gets from the public fund could be equal to its average vote share in all elections in the past 10 years. There could be separate funds for the national level, state level and even constituency level that anonymous donors could donate to. That would ensure that regional parties get their fair share in their states or parties like AIMIM which are strong only in a couple of constituencies get their fair share in their strongholds.'
'Dont you think that will kill the purpose of anonymity. I know parties are using it as a loophole but anonymity is essential otherwise government will have a good personal data of individual political party supporters.'

"US has public financing & all presidential candidates before Obama opted for state funding. Obama was the first ever major party US presidential candidate to refuse public financing because he wanted to accept funding from lobbyists. If you take public financing, you cannot take money directly from lobbyists. All previous presidential candidates from both the major parties before Obama fought elections with public financing. Even in the 2008 elections when Obama made history by refusing public financing, his opponent John McCain didn't. McCain fought the election with public financing. I think McCain was last serious candidate to use public financing.\n\nPublic financing is a very good idea but will serve no purpose in India. Because unlike the US, in India most election expenditure is unaccounted for & not on the books. So BJP & Congress will use public financing as a supplement to their regular chor funding rather than as a replacement. It has one small benefit that someone with no other funding can get public financing if they fulfill some conditions."

"Regarding demonitization, I feel that people were more affected by the fact that a government can take such a strong step than the step itself and that is what is helping BJP and Modi now. \n\nBesides, his PR has been really good. AAP may have done some good things in Delhi but Kejriwal kept on making a fool of himself by his continuous bitching about Modi, which, frankly, became cringeworthy (looking at *What's the deal Modiji?* ). \n\nThen admit it or not, Modi has been successful in his foreign policies, the world is noticing India and our relevance has certainly increased. If they do not fuck up this strong mandate and keep working towards better taxation, stronger growth and manufacturing, lowering corruption and more transparency then 2019 is totally in BJP's pocket without doubt.\n\nAnd yeah, fuck Congress.

'Very very good signs for Modi. The key to retaining majority for Modi is UP as it would be difficult to recover too many seats from a fall of seats in UP (from 73). But, this shows that the popularity of Modi in UP is quite high and the fall at this stage will be quite small.'
'Unlike the steak socialists of randia ( calling them so because of their obsession of showing how edgy they are by eating beef) most people were not affected by demonetization beyond a month.

'Certainly hope so.'

"I really believe it now.Demo was the make or break thing and the nation has wholeheartedly embraced it.\n\nIts not about whether the decision was successful or not but govt exercising such obscene power over a country , it maybe within constitution but felt supremely dictatorial.\n\nAnd the way they were so  frivolous with people's money ,it will never sit right with me.Went back on their own word, altered rules every second day, it was one hell of shitshow.\n\nBut clearly the faith in Modi is so intense all this was overlooked.    "
'Hard to say. Indian elections are inherently unpredictable and a lot can change in 2 years. For example in 2014 even with the euphoria over the historic Lok Sabha verdict even most BJP supporters did not expect that Amit Shah would be able to sustain such a performance till the UP assembly elections in 2017.'
'Hello, as an American I came across this headline:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/03/11/asia/uttar-pradesh-elections/index.html\n\nThe headline was "Why these Indian state elections matter to the whole world", but the article does nothing to describe the WHY part. Can anyone maybe give some insight into why Modi winning would affect the rest of the world, or why other countries should have any thoughts on this election?\n\nI\'m just really curious what the political situation in India is like! Is Modi a right wing guy, a left wing guy, are people generally happy with him, do people hate him, or is it about even?\n\nWhat are his proponents saying about him, and what are him opponents also saying? \n\nThanks for any feedback!'

"I think it's been a great day for Congress. The rumours of their death have been greatly exaggerated - They seem to be taking Punjab. In Manipur & Goa, never thought they would do well. Great show!"
'Now that BJP has its Rajya Sabha majority, can we please get the promised golden age of India?'
"I'm happy with Congress performance. Nobody expected them to win UP. But they regained Punjab, Goa and held Manipur. Overall quite good."
"This result might deflate Akhilesh's rising star. Hopefully it'll lead to a split of the party so that SP can never come back again.\n\nWhat UP and the nation needs is a better second option to BJP."

India is becoming more like Pakistan."\n\nThis is from a great little article in NYT.\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/opinion/india-and-pakistan-at-war-against-peaceniks.html?referer=https://www.google.co.in/'
"Which is why it isn't prudent to have a political party as your 'favorite' which you blindly support. \n\nThen you become such a person who can see no wrong with their way of functioning because of your 'love' towards that party and forget 'harsh' criticisms, you'll be singing paeans and doing mental gymnastics to support them just so that they continue to remain the party that you love.\n\nIn the end you'll just be a person so eager to gobble up the lies they dish out specifically designed to just to get your vote!"
'First of all freedom of expression is two way street not one way. If some one criticism can be stupid so can the response. Second and most important part is freedom of expression protects you from government punishing you for what you spoke not political alienation.

He should stick to that no matter what political consequence he has to face.\n\nAgain freedom of expression protect one from ***government tyranny not from political or societal alienation.*** \n\nMy advice to Sandeep Dikshit is grow a spine and stick to what think not what may give political mileage.'
'Thanks for sharing'
"I think there has to be a clear protocol where the Indian military shares some amount of Intel/briefings with elected legislators.

It's merely ensuring the military is not being used to score political points one way or the other."
"> discussions about whether or not surgical strikes happened tend to veer towards the pointless side, to say the least.\n\nFunnily enough, its usually the pro-govt channels where most of this discussion happens. Usually a set up, easy to get some joker on the panel to argue that it didn't happen and then bash him with the full repertoire of anti-national/goto Pakistan/how dare you??/sickular/libtard/etc counter arguments."
'> discussions about whether or not surgical strikes happened tend to veer towards the pointless side\n\nWhy?'
'There are even those that realise this and are okay with it.'
'A lot of people actually know it well. They are looking for a Iran Style Hindu Theocracy.'
"Well yeah, it's not like Chinese or American or British Army is going to protect us anytime soon."
'I agree. The military as an institution is very different from others. Democracy/Theocracy/Monarchy be it any kind of state, military does the dirty work of defending it, and should be accorded some privileges like that.'
"An individual may love his/her 'favourite' party, nothing wrong with that (although I personally agree with whatever you said).\n\nIt becomes a problem when no one can voice their dissent. As long as the person in blind love with their party is not stopping free speech, it's fine. If that person is countering/critiquing (howsoever weak and fallacious), that's fine too. The problem is when the other person is not allowed to speak at all (or harmed after speaking)."
"> It's merely ensuring the military is not being used to score political points one way or the other.\n\nThe achievements of the military should never be used for political mileage by political parties in their ads or in their electoral speeches.\n\nNor should military involve in cheap acts like parading on a jeep and rewarding those who did so and harmful acts like going on a raping spree - the moment they indulge in it they lose their veneer and become prime targets for criticism!"
'>I think there has to be a clear protocol where the Indian military shares some amount of Intel/briefings with elected legislators. When Bin Laden was killed the US Military had to share the videos of the raid with a bipartisan congressional committee.\n\nThis is actually a great idea. We should definitely do this- assuage opposition criticisms/worries without compromising security. '
"We do? As in, we should be supporting, sharing, and debating 'valid' criticisms of the army. We shouldn't be engaging in the usual political shit flinging about if surgical strikes *really* happened or something like that that's honestly best left to the likes of SuSu and Kejriwal on Twitter."
'>if i say something it must be true\n\nThis is not a reasonable comment. The idea of a criticism needing to be "valid" is euphemistic nonsense for censorship. Who but a government actor, which in India\'s case is necessarily a political appointment because of the party based electoral system, could make a determination of legal "validity"? That is, "validity" to any extent that it would be concerning enough to discuss? \n\nGet a grip.'
'> An individual may love his/her \'favourite\' party, nothing wrong with that\n\nYep nothing wrong with it which is why I said "it isn\'t prudent"\n\n>It becomes a problem when no one can voice their dissent.\n\nIMO, the problem starts when your love for the party (however harmless it is to others) stops you from critically analyzing the party\'s work being done as \'your public servant\' and taking informed decisions to decry their shoddy acts they do drunk on power, such things, from as simple as *taking undue credit* to  *corruption* to *killing whistleblowers*!'
'So solar energy and highway building cannot be questioned or criticized?'
"I'm not saying it should be made public. I'm saying at least a bipartisan team of legislators should have the ability to question and verify any action performed by the military."
'Well, I thought the question about whether the strikes happened was valid & contributed to the country, so I supported it & shared it. '
'> We do\n\n"We" as in you and me or just you who decides what everyone should be thinking\n>we should be supporting, sharing, and debating \'valid\' criticisms of the army. We shouldn\'t be engaging in the usual political shit flinging about if surgical strikes really happened or something like that that\'s honestly best left to the likes of SuSu and Kejriwal on Twitter.\n\n?'
"I get your point but the idea of loyal opposition is that we're all still on the same side at the end of the day but just see the path forward differently"
"Of course we shouldn't censor criticism. Where did I indicate anything otherwise?"
'Okay, so people have been doing that. People have been criticizing military and then other people are criticizing those people. Fair and square by your logic. \nEdit- you can see where are we with this type of voting where people vote without understanding what they are waiting for.\nSophistry will also not take us anywhere. People can keep arguing but without substance those arguments are good for nothing and will never provide any closure.'

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n\t\t\t    Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor\'s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n \n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user\'s freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers\' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.'

"**Chutiya:** Ha guys anybdy hv dat Mona Sing mms\n\n\n**ME:** The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow."

"today someone was honking continuously like crazy,\nas usual i never look back.. i put my full focus on driving and my priority is just to do the task.. going A TO B place.\nstrangly this guy comes up and asks me why you didn't stop i was honking for so many times..\ni said.. you know we have go these people who honk for no reason so i assumed you are one of that ASH HOLE. :D"
'I find this very hard to believe, lol. '
'Lol he gets fined immediately. If he parks in a no-parking area they put a lock on his wheels and he will have to pay a fine.'
'Fucking amazing! I am a Himachali, residing in Haryana, fortunately in a peaceful suburb. I just wish govt. implements the same here so that the noisy areas also get some peace and quiet. '
'The only states I hear good news everytime are Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and lately Telangana.\n\n'
'I feel happy for you guys. ☺'
"Reminds me of my recent trip to Bangkok, where it is not banned. During my more than 30 day stay there, never heard a **single** honk; even though it's riddled with traffic. Made me happy and sad at the same time.."
"It doesn't have very good internet but I'm sure they are working on it. "
'My friend got fined for using high beam in Jaipur'
'Not that I am aware of but I would be glad if they did. I personally never use it in the city. '
"Are you from Delhi / North India? I've noticed that high beam problem is way more common there. Like in Bombay, I hardly saw anyone use them which was pleasantly surprising. "
'Are you certain about this? In the roads on the western ghats there are signs that ask you to honk as a safety precaution.'
"If I remember correctly, the driving test theory I took actually recommended honking in way too many places. And given then situation in India, I think it makes sense. You can't discourage honking without enforcing lane driving, using indicators and following traffic lights. In fact horns are needed to drive safely in India. "
'>They even look & dress as good. \n\n...'
"So I am Himachali working in south. It amazes me when I drive back home. People prefer to have 1 km line on their side of the road than piling up say while crossing a narrow bridge. Of course there are assholes everywhere and we do honk but overall it's never as crazy as I find it elsewhere.  "
' I went to Sikkim few days before. The place is amazing and great place to shop for but some of the places at Sikkim do not accept cards,so keep your cash ready.'
'Well, you now know how I got rich! ;)'
'You need to explain this better. '
'Yeah, I went to two other cities in Thailand and they were all like that. It was really nice.'
'I guess this way natural selection will take care of the traffic.'
'Lord bless the Jaipur police!!'
"I also paid fine for using high beam in Jaipur, 4-5 years ago. Don't use high beam now. :P"
'this is the problem with indian driving instructors. They dont teach you to be careful or mindful of others. Instead honk and warn others that you are coming.\n\nStop honking and you will automatically become a more careful and better driver'
'Also because they take turns at high speeds in cars not designed for that performance and when they lack the confidence to corner sharp '
'But they are also very polite & uncorrupt, hence they get the respect of the drivers. In other states traffic cops do not hold their part of the bargain so drivers feel they do not need to do theirs.'
"Can confirm. Been there in 2010. There's also this street in Gangtok that makes you forget you're in India. Especially after sunset.\n\nHands down the best state I've been to so far. "
'Ah, okay. This was 6 years ago. Spent a month and was quite surprised. '
"There was a pretty long time in the middle when it wasn't, though."
'I think public reporting is already a thing with fb pages of the respective police dept. Your idea is better because there is incentive. I hope it works'
"Your comment above didn't mention main road, and even on main roads (not highways) you are expected to be prepared for people crossing, not just assume that people are going to fall in line because you have the right of way.\n\nSince you've modified your statement, let me ask you, do you honk at the intersections when driving on the side roads?"

"So, has that post been deleted from the Jayadev fellas FB page? I couldn't find it, but there is a subsequent post referring to the screenshot with the prediction. What's he saying in that?\n\nSo the post isn't deleted. but for the love of god, can someone tell me how he is justifying it in that subsequent post?"

'> Let me stress that this is not sarcasm or satire.\n\nSurely you are being deliberately disingenuous here.

'Facebook timestamps are displayed based on the location of the person who reads them.

'
'What bait? I see no bait. Op delivered as promised. In fact OP delivered better than promised.'
'Better Somalia will become Pakistan :)'
'"I agree with this one. It\'s the only sensible one." '
"By that logic, why did people just take screenshots and not archive the facebook link while it was active, which would have proved the timestamp without dispute? If they had, it would have proved the 'sanghi' conspiracy, no?"
"If there is simpler explanation to an event then its mostly true. But sure go r/conspiracy when a user can easily screenshot in different timezone and the op himself hasn't uploaded any screenshot himself and using a local site as proof. Pardon me if I don't believe this flimsy proof to bring out the forks."

"Nah, it's a 1.5 crop sensor. The lens are the standard option lens that come with the body. \n\nI have a 19mm prime that I use for wide angle shots like in Mumbai or Jaipur. "
"Is it on netflix? I might have seen it. While I agree the concept of minimalism, I feel like they were pushing their ideas onto other people. It's easier to do once you develop a habit. My favorite possession is my camera when I'm traveling. When I'm back home, it's my car. \n\n Honestly speaking, I feel much more free and relaxed because I don't have to look after those possessions. I wouldn't have learned to live minimally if I didn't travel the way I did. "
"I'm 23. \n\nRight now? I don't do anything except travel. I worked through university to pay my bills and worked 2 jobs after getting out. I was living at home to save a sizable chunk, and here I am. "
"Yup it's on Netflix.\nThey seemed a little pushy but they always explained it as a responsible way of living not as the only way of living and they were flexible just like you said about the camera and car anology.\nYou are absolutely right about the last part about travelling .\n\n"
'Probably not the way I did it, however I have loads of friends who traveled outside of India. One of them works for an it company on an h-1b visa and travels to around North and South America on his holidays, 2 own their own businesses, so they travel to meet clients. 1 person family owns a restaurant in London, but he works in India and manages the finances of the restaurant. \n\nAlthough it may not be possible the way I do it (NRI living in the states), there are alternatives to travel. '
'Well, now you are getting somewhere. Honestly, it\'s impossible for someone who is studying to work somewhere. For whatever reason. Even if they do, they won\'t earn enough to travel in India. \n\nThen, most of the Indians go outside for the "hoopla" and the pictures. *"Hee haa, we have a picture in front of Big Ben, Eiffel Tower, Collosseum.* No one really knows how the city functions at all, leave alone backpacking. \n\nBut anyway, kudos to you.

'Modi\'s speeches are like the Quran. You have to interpret them in the context of what he\'s talking about. Like when he offers 15 lakh per person, it\'s when he\'s asking to be voted into power. Ergo, what he actually says is "vote for me and put me in charge of your country". Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHe never made this offer in any other context. So in this case, it is to be interpreted only in one way.'

"I have never read Quran or any other holy book, so I am not sure how the interpretation logic should be like. But he very clearly said, if all the black money is brought back to India, everyone's account can be credited with 15L. It doesn't however imply that everyone will get 15L. \n\nHe just used that as a form of expression to help people understand how big the black money problem is."
"IDK, I thought it was straight forward. It's the liberals who created 15L meme."
"> if all the black money is brought back to India, everyone's account can be credited with 15L\n\nRs. 15L x 120 cr Indians = Rs. 1800 lakh crore is the amount of black money out there. Nearly 2000 times India's GDP."
'We are in the post-truth world saar. Charisma and Narrative are the only requirements to succeed in politics now.

"You believe that there's $24 trillion worth black money?\n\nEdit: To put that in perspective, that figure is significantly higher than US GDP (~$16 trillion). Also, the amount of wealth held by Americans was estimated at ~$85 trillion last year."
"Right,  I don't know the numbers and I don't think Modi has made any scientific estimate of how much black money is stashed. But this isn't something that was acquired over an year or two. It's years worth of accumulation, so, I am guessing it's based on some sort of reports that give an estimate of how much black money this country currently has."
"Yeah, but America too has acquired its wealth over the same long period. I find it hard to believe that the amount of black money would be anywhere near that amount. For example, as per Wikipedia, all the wealth held by Indians was ~$3 trillion. $24 trillion is 8 times that. I don't think that Black Money is THAT big a component, completely dwarfing white money."

Ambedkar quoted John Stuart Mill, who cautioned citizens not ‘to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with powers which enable him to subvert their institutions’. This warning was even more pertinent here than in England, for in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be the road to the salvation of a soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.'

Ughhh.\n\nI haven't watched any dance show since DID2. But I have to admit the Dance Champions currently televised on Star Plus feels kinda fresh. Two performers(or teams, or couple) going head to head in a battle for 3-4 minutes. And the level of dance especially by Bad Salsa, Wild ripperz, MJ5 is truly international level. Best part is that not a single actor has come to this show to promote his movie yet."

'So I actually took the quiz.

But I fail to understand how relevant they are in countries like Japan or South Korea. Surely the smart people of Ipsos group who specialize in opinion and social research could have designed a questionnaire more suited to each country to better judge the ignorance of their citizens. Was it laziness which is responsible for one of the top market research companies to design such a one-yardstick-measures-them-all survey? Was it the demand of their client to obtain some specific kind of data? Is it the case of asking a barrage of questions to get the answer of one/some specific question(s) inserted casually in between?

'**Kartavirya Arjuna**\n\nKartavirya Arjuna (Sanskrit: कार्तवीर्य अर्जुन, Kārtavīrya Arjuna; also known as Sahasrabahu Arjuna) was a legendary king of an ancient Haihayas kingdom with capital at Mahishmati which is on the banks of Narmada River in the current state of Madhya Pradesh. Kartavirya was son of Kritavirya, king of the Haihayas. This is his patronymic, by which he is best known; his is also referred to simply as Arjuna. He is described as having a thousand hands and a great devotee of god Dattatreya.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'

'My best experience was during a Rahman concert in the US.

"This reminds me of an incident that happened to me during my honeymoon trip to Goa.\n\nWe rented an activa so that we can freely travel in the city. But I totally forgot to check the fuel level. After around 1 AM in night, when we were at a location quite far from our resort, activa went out of fuel. There was no human soul around to ask for help. So I asked my wife to walk by me while I pull activa to the resort.\n\nI kept on pulling activa for almost half an hour when a couple on avenger stopped near us. They asked us what is the matter. I explained them the situation. \n\nI don't remember where exact in Goa this incident happened but there were very few petrol pumps around. Some elderly ladies used to sell petrol from their homes in used 1 ltr mineral water bottles, with ₹10-15 markup above the market price of petrol. This was only way to get your vehicle refueled without going to distant petrol pumps.\n\nWithout my asking for help, the couple told us to relax and stay on the spot while they bring one of these petrol bottles. I told them that would be a great help.\n\nThey went away to fetch the fuel. But after 15 minutes when they didn't return, I lost hope and started pulling the activa again. It was quite late in night and we were alone. We were worried that some street thugs might attack us.\n\nBut they kept their promise. I thanked them and tried to pay them the cost of the fuel but they refused to take it. They told us that they are from Udaipur and they too are on their honeymoon trip. They were just happy to help us as this could happen to anyone, even them.\n\nI offered them to take them out for lunch next day, but they said that they are leaving early next morning.\n\nSo yes, some people really go out of their way to help others."

Many people are saying every Bangalorian knows what happens there on 31st, why go there with your girlfriend/wife/family. Brigade Road and MG Road are host to a lot of restaurants, pubs and bars which hold big NYE events. Many people visit them with their partners as they are by and large well controlled. But then they get out after 12am they are suddenly thrown into a huge crowd of drunk fucks who will run at your partner yelling Happy New Year for a "friendly hug".

"Why should anyone give a flying fuck about angsty 20 something's thinking one way or the other about ayurveda. Vast swathes of just about any 'herbal medicine' system around the world have been absorbed into main stream Western medicine when the relevant research was able to demonstrate effectiveness and isolate the active ingredient. \n\nThe biggest gripe FDA has with herbal medicine is that plants don't have a fixed concentration of whatever chemical that works. So using plant products directly instead of extracting and isolating the chemical, makes it hard to fix dosage. On top of that ayurveda is like open source. Why spend millions on rnd and clinical trials when your patent is gonna be diaputed in court by some company selling the original product. \n\nDespite that products like ashwagandha are sold as dietery supplements in the US. Safe to say the people running the united States food and drug administration know more than the average r india subscriber. Of course this is just one example.\n\nBefore writing off ayurveda as hogwash we should consider the fact that most students who get into ayurveda were people who were unsuccessful at getting into MBBS. Thats why they suck. Sometimes they are also babas with no training on the subject. Ita the public's fault if they trust an unqualified quack."

Sure, some tiny piece of it is genuine medicine, but a lot of it is mumbo jumbo Dravidian sky-daddy worshipping BS that might as well be the equivalent of Anglo-Saxon blood letting , Roman lead-mercury eating, European homeopathy or Voodoo medicine. All of which are just nonsense wrapped around a very small kernel of truth. Just like the Sangam Literature, it is stuff we need to throw away as it has little value. I mean, come on, why are you guys still trying to justify going apeshit over bulls and eating off the streets. I have to imagine that is some stuff that some Aryan doctor probably told those Dravidian bonded laborers in the hope that they might die off, and instead those Dravidians put it into their "holy" books.'
"yeah there's always a text supporting everyone's agenda and if there's no text then they'll say Hindusim doesnt depend on scriptures, its a way of life and bullshit like that. Its like having the cake and eating it too. For example the caste system. Many modern day apologists say caste system cannot be attributed to Hinduism because no scripture that mentions caste system but they'll also say Hinduism is a way of life, culture and it doesn't depend on scriptures or holy texts like Abrahmic religions."

"Boss, its a fucking trick. So every time you marry, you promise to stay together for saat janam.. its like one of those self renewing website subscriptions.

'The spiritual side of this is completely different. \n\nIt doesn’t talk about consumption, but it is mentioned for activities like farming, so that seems pretty common. '
"You are right about Upanishads. But the thing is Upanishads were composed almost at the same time as Buddhism and Jainism were founded. So it can said that all three of them were against the prevailing Social customs in ancient India. \n\nAbout Buddism's influence on Hinduism, I can answer from a historical POV. Buddhism which began in India in 5th century BC emerged as the most dominant religion in India in the ancient times and enjoyed that status for around 7-8 centuries until the Guptan Age where popular Mahayana Buddhist ideas like idolatry, not killing animals for sport and rituals, etc. were inducted into Hinduism. Later the rise of Brahmin kings meant that the state patronage for Buddhism stopped and Hinduism once again became the dominant religion. I can even add that idolatry was first introduced in India by Mahayanism and was later adopted by all Indian religions. "

The lack of political will to do the right things is the only reason why this issue lingers on. Armies occupy territory but integration is always done by civilian agents, but if our strategic needs are just met by occupying the territory then boots on the ground have been doing it for the last 30 years, let it go on.'

'*Kashmir is strategically important to India due its Geographic location \n\n*One movement leads to another.

If a  referendum is held in core Naxal area, then the results might well be in favor of separation. If this keeps continuing then the Indian state might be reduced to nothing. '
"Firefighters and policemen can quit though. Soldiers can't desert. \n\nThere are many jobs that involve the risk of death - from menial jobs like sewage workers and construction, to the more respected ones involving walking into burning buildings and arresting criminals. \n\nThere are not many where you can legally be punished for not taking on that risk and refusing to head into *certain* death. This fact is drilled into all soldiers' heads. For the period of their service, their lives *belong* to the state to expend as they see fit. They basically voluntarily give up all rights to their own lives and bodies for that time. The armed forces aren't too big on stuff like privacy and freedom of speech either (yeah, that includes twitter and other social media accounts), so they're effectively signing away all their rights for a limited time period too. And facing a military tribunal is a whole different ballgame than civilian courts, so they're judged by a different rulebook, and a different set of laws. All of that is a major sacrifice.\n\n>Also, considering that the Indian army is unaccountable for a lot of shit that goes on in J&K, is it really what we want? Soldiers who are never questioned and always venerated.\n\nThe respect is overall well-deserved in my opinion. Just like any group of people, there will be a certain number of scumbags, rapists, sociopaths, and psychopaths among them. That doesn't change. But our troops are extraordinarily disciplined compared to pretty much any other first-world army. Civilians don't always hear about the internal processes of oversight and accountability within the forces, and the forces do not publicize it, because in an army, internal morale is far more important than appeasing the press. But just because you don't hear about it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. What people forget is, that the army is *not* a democracy. The army is *not* a place to practice civil-liberties and free speech. The army is *not* an institution where the same rules apply. Our army is not one that's meddling in the affairs of some far-off land for no good reason. They act only on our own soil, and where the UN sends us. There's a good reason that India has been the largest troop contributor to UN Peacekeeping Forces since its inception. India has taken part in 43 Peacekeeping missions with a total contribution exceeding 180,000 troops and a significant number of police personnel deployed. \n\nOur forces have a solid reputation in the international defense forum, even if they are relatively poorly-equipped. That's not something gained by just having lots of troops. You don't get that kind of discipline by allowing the deviant members to get away with doing whatever they please, because if that were the case, there would be absolutely no end to the amount of looting, raping, pillaging, and murder that would happen on a daily basis in every corner. Are there incidents and lapses that take place? Absolutely. But if you think for one instant that the army (as an institution) is *okay* with that, and doesn't take them seriously, then you're sorely mistaken."

"I'm in US, and to be honest, I've seen both sides. I've seen liberal and progressive Muslims, who strongly believe in gender equality, against purdah, and also celebrate and eat prasads at Hindu festivals and even sell statues and puja samagris. There are some who are even Gandhians and vegetarian.\n\nI've also seen other Muslims who are extremists and keep trying to evangelically convert others by giving religious sermons. And everyone in between.\n\nI generally have a policy - judge people by their values, and not which team they belong to, and I certainly don't generalize all Indian Muslims or Pakistanis and will stand up against discrimination towards them. But I also don't give anyone a free pass just because someone belongs to a minority. I think that is fair and everybody can agree."
"Electing Modi to power doesnt equal to Hating Pakistanis or Muslims....\n\nI'm sure than more than 50% of those who voted for Modi didnt vote for bringing a Ram rajya and taking revenge on Muslims for what the Mughals and Ghazni etc did to them....\n\nThey voted because of the scams done by congress and no good alternative...If Modi doesnt perform,he will be thrown and someone else will be elected... \n\nI'm in US and when I was in NY,one of my favorite eating joint was a pakistani restaurant....They were very friendly and they used to put a little extra when I ordered ..... \n\nAlso I've seen that many pakistanis are very cagey when they approach Indians because they are afraid of us ..."
'Was in a NY restaurant few months back, my colleague was confused and taking too long to decide what to order, when the manager of the place who happened to be from Pakistan overhead us so he came over and just said let me get food for you that I think you will like. That was one of the best meals we had in a long time. The way he spoke to us with such warmth, addressing us as "Bhaijaan". To be honest, I come across many Indians at several places but just don\'t feel the same. '

"Indians and Pakistanis seek each other our and become friends. Even turn into each others support system. I have seen it in France, UK, US, UAE and Australia.  \n\nBasically because Goras and Arabs don't care a shit about either. So they just have each other.    "
'I really had awesome butter chicken and nan at this restaurant in Bangkok. It was run by Pakistani brothers and he gave us priority service ignoring all the white people who came before us.  Unlike India, where whites are treated like Gods. We chatted a bit and discussed about lives at both side of the borders. It was really an eye opening experience.'
"Off topic but I had to post.\n\nThis is my experience as a Punjabi who has travelled a bit: \n\n- Pakistanis: have a special affinity towards Punjabi Indians. My brother who looks Persian by all accounts always attracts Pakistanis and Iranians from far and wide who think - oh ye to apna banda hai. Like I have seen them break supermarket queues to come say Hi to him. It doesn't matter when they later find out he's a Hindu. Any Pakistani bus or taxi driver is open and friendly. Two Pakistani guys showed interest in me which all came to abrupt end once the words 'magar hamare Islam mein...' and 'haan magar Aamir Khan to Muslim hi hai na' were uttered.\n\n- Afghanis and Iranians: love Indians! General topic of discussion that unites us is our contempt for Pakistanis, and 'love' of Hindi movies. The Afghani driver didn't fail to point out though that, oh but Hindus have so many gods..\n\n- Sri Lankans: Sinhalese don't mix with Tamilians even with SL Tamilians and, have a special hatred for India obviously. Melbourne is apparently the capital of SL expats and the Sinhalese that I know are really sweet people except that they really really *really* dont like India. After lots of observations my conclusion is that - India is the big brother. These guys think that India is a bully - kinda weird feeling when you realise that India is seen as powerful by some people. Who'd a thunk it? I will never support SL in any match, except against Australia.\n\n- Bangladeshis: These guys are Bongs before anything else. I have seen that Hindu Bengalis and Muslim Bangladeshis are really really, fiercely,  proud of their Bangla culture and are frequently socialising with each other. On a number of occasions one of these Bangladeshi aunties have told me, why would you want to leave India? It is so beautiful? After talking to her I fully believe that part of her family is now living illegally in India. Her relatives were in the army fighting for the Pakistani side in '71, so she has special reason to NOT be in India. \n\nConclusion: The Indian subcontinent is real. Kids of India, but especially north India, who have grown up being exposed to all Indians - Punjabis, Gujratis, Sindhis, Bengalis, Tamilians etc - the people, the language, the culture, the food - We will be able to find something in common with everyone from the subcontinent. All the more reason to preserve and celebrate all our languages and cultures and while realising how incredibly strong we are in unity. The other countries in the subcontinent are too homogenous, and are intimidating by differences. \n\n(Sorry I just saw Dangal - sniff - so emotional. Jai Hind, Jai Maharashtra.)"
"I've met a lot of nice Pakistanis just like I've met a lot of nice Brits, Americans, Aussies, Bangladeshis etc but I've never had the smug satisfaction of making a preachy self post about it... probably because I judge people independent of their heritage"
"Off-course! We're basically the same. I grew up in the Middle East then went to US for uni. I had bunch of Pakistani friends since I was a kid. We spoke in Punjabi. Our languages are almost identical other than the dialects across Punjab. We share the same culture. \n\nI remember back in college, my Pakistani buddies and I would get shitfaced on the weekend and listen to Urdu and Punjabi poetry, Nusrat Sahab, Hans Raj Hans, Gurdas Maan, Junoon etc. This is the cultural bond we have! Specially the regions of Delhi, Punjab and UP have waay too much common with the Pakistani population!\n\n Aint no border can separate this for long. Peace is inevitable. "

"A lot of ppl will brand me a bhakt or a psychopath for saying this but I'll say it anyway.\n\nThe idea of Akhand Bharat has merit. Hinduism and Vedic philosophy are the perfect catalyst to offset the more crazier aspects of abrahamic religions and create a uniform philosophy working beyond boundaries of religion and social structures which can appeal to all as a singular philosophy.\n\nWe already see some variants of this core philosophy or attempts to achieve it from the creation of Sufism, Sikhism and Din-i-alahi along with the works of ppl like Darah Shikoh, Ghalib, Sai baba etc.\n\nThere is a reason the powers that be sought to egg on Partition, simply because they wanted us to be separated and constantly fighting over artificial borders. This is isnt just about geopolitics and power of nation states but about control over the human psyche and philosophy itself. \n\nThe Indian Subcontinent and Indochina states are unique in the sense that they somehow manage to find a balance between Vedic, Buddhist, Confucian and Abhramanic religions. I cant explain exactly how but its there, its happening and its been happening for a long time.\n\nThe day we remove these artificial borders and unite the whole region from Iran to Indonesia into one cohesive unit, it will act as an example to show that it is in fact possible to get over the boundaries of race, caste (social structure) and religion for good."
'A lot of people are dissing the OP for callling Pakistanis as the same as us. Some even said we need to judge Pakistan on its action as a state. Which is fair. \nWhat I think we need to understand from this is that a considerable population of Pakistan is sane, progressive and liberal. Not blindly paint them all as some Hateful, sharia loving mullahs. \nWe need to engage more with these people so that one day they come to power and represent the Pakistan state. From army generals in pak army to politicians. Only then can we get peace. '

'Once I met a Pakistani Uncle in Vienna. That day I learnt that they (pakis) are so fond of us. But we\'re reserved and feel like taboo talking to them. He wasn\'t a "progressive" muslim going by his appearance but certainly more open minded than us. He told me about his birthplace in India (Ambala) and talked on various personal topics from Khushwant singh to Engineering to Mudiji. Yes, pakis are disgusted with Mudi. We\'re all same.'
"Except that we're not the same people. We were at some point but we're not anymore. Each society is held together by myths (not in a religion term but more in a societal term) and markers that form the underpinnings of their culture. For example, partition is the foundational myth of India and Pakistan but they're both two fundamentally different myths of the same event. Sure we have markers and myths that overlap, such as good etc, but the ones that seem to really bins the two societies in their own countries together are fundamentally different. \n\nSo for me, a good rule of thumb is to be happy we share a great many markers and be happy that I found people (form anywhere really) who show me kindness and respect. And i tend to judge them on an individual basis because people tend to behave and adapt based on their surroundings too. Give each person the benefit of being an individual is pretty much my mantra.

">I'm clearly referring to open source projects where anyone can contribute.\n\nWell you shouldn't use the term open source then cause it refers to something else entirely.

And why use secondary sources at all, when you could use the references linked to, instead?\n\nWikipedia also happens to be much more lax than r/india in what newspapers to trust, so it's possible to end up in absurdities like a wiki article being allowed on r/india whose sources wouldn't pass r/india's bar for direct posting."

There are some schemes in this page information about which isn\'t present on the "List of government schemes in India" page. Information about those could be added to that page. Adding an entire column to the table in that page will be giving way too much importance to a minor controversy.'
'There is a difference between the contribution model of open source projects and wikipedia though. In open source projects, the contribution is usually reviewed before being merged to a main branch. Wikipedia is a lot more permissive by comparison. All edits are accepted until another editor decides to take a look and correct/revert the changes. On new articles, the policy is especially permissive, as wikipedia editors usually allow a few weeks for the original author to provide sources and improve quality of the article before it is deleted.'
'> Adding an entire column to the table in that page will be giving way too much importance to a minor controversy.\n\nIt is not about controversy but accuracy of information. If a government scheme had another name in the past, it needs to be presented in a non-biased way. '

'The funny thing is, in the US, Starbucks is synonymous with shit coffee. And people who actually drink quality coffee know this. Fast food is "food" in the US, unlike here where you get a wholesome meal even in the shittiest of canteens. So "grabbing" a large–ass cup of coffee makes little sense here. \n\nMore importantly, India is a tropical county. So the whole trope of you going to Starbucks at sub 50°F while holding on dearly to your office bag and leather coat, doesn\'t apply here. Good for Starbucks though, they didn\'t even have to be innovative to get the crowds.\n\nI used to be part of this crowd. But the whole vacuousness of it all scarred my soul.

'"Sardar ji" is actually used in a very respectful manner in Punjab. Do not ever confuse this as an insult there. Calling someone just a "sardar" can be disrespectful. It majorly matters on the tone and the context in which you say it. You may not end up on good terms if you use sardar but sardarji is always respectful. '
"Its probably different with everyone. In my case when ever I got called bhaiya I got friend zoned. And it's every interaction with girl."
"Yep. But a new zone  is created by Indian society. And it's called bhaiya zoned. Similar to nice guys but also different because a stranger can even bhaiya zone you."
'Where in the world do you live, because afaik bhaiyaa is used everywhere(at least in the hindi belt), Delhi, kota , benaras and Bihar. People don\'t use it exclusively for biharis or UPites. It is a term to show respect and is used mostly due to lack of any other term. I don\'t know how do people have came to this conclusion that it is used for ganwaar bihari and UPites and made this a derogatory term which shows the classism of "modern shahri" people.'
'Calling someone a brother should be respectful way to address someone.'
"Ehh, you can pretty much tell where to make the distinction. I mean, it's not that hard to guess someone's age (in a 10 year window). Why would I call someone twice my age bhaiya?\n\nI've found people to be pretty chill about 'bhaiya', 'uncle', 'maam', 'aunty', in my personal experience in Delhi (and the hindi North India).

"Within India, honestly there's just no marketing of any non-bollywood music. Heck, even googling for Indian artists involved in rock, electronic or whatever is a chore. If they exist, they barely have more than a few albums out and if they've been in the game for a reasonable time you'll see their credits on Bollywood tracks. \n\nIndia has some good music festivals that they could use to spotlight these artists but often they are overshadowed by some mediocre international artists that recieves all the attention.  \n\nPakistan at least has an independent music scene and shows like Coke Studio (I realize there is an Indian version as well), Nescafe Basement, and Walnut Studios that promote bands, creativity, and original music. \n\nThe only issue is that Bollywood makes this kind of scene hard flourish by offering large $$$ contracts to singers to become playback singers so that 'music scene' just sort of seems like a stepping stone to get recognized and land a lucrative deal. \n\nJust take a look at Atif Aslam, Mohan Kanan, and Mohit Chauhan. "
"And by the way, who pays for Indian music? \n\nMost of us are probably content to 'download' and play a digital copy of our favorite tunes. "

SRK got a guitar in that challa song and this guy is the king of romance. I mean the kind of choices he has made after MNIK really makes me doubtful that he can't do anything else except for that big hand gesture. This is not how a king/actor is defined. Salman bhai sang `main hoon hero tera` on auto tune and he became a superhit singer overnight. So much so that bhai got angry that Arjit singh slept during that award function. hashtagsalmanchutiya. *Rant*\n\nWhat in the motherfuck is going on with bollywood?\n\nThese are the people who have spent 30 years in the industry and are now doubtful about their career choices. The new comers must seriously evaluate what they want to do. Varun dhawan and Arjun kapoor take bhai as a model. *le lag gayi*\n\nI have always proposed how Music and Movie industry should be separate. Arjit's popularity depends on if he sings for big stars. Same for other singers as well. The problem is that the generation before, singers were popular due to the same reason and they either don't want to innovate or don't know how to. \n\nThank god for online content to break this khan, bachchan and kapoor monopoly."
"Well on a positive note, Carnatic musicians in Tamil Nadu are keeping the culture alive over the years by training more and more vocalists and instrumentalists every year. I believe Carnatic music  represents a significant part in the overall Indian music scene. \n\nIs it seeing a decline in quality? Probably yes because the modern child is stuffed with a myriad of options and it's hard for them to devote their entire attention only to music. Plus many great vocalists move to playback singing where they're using the basics learned from traditional music and implementing it with modern fusion and the kind of music movies and people expect ( which isn't bad imo just that it leads to a decline in the overall exclusive classical musician numbers) \n\nIs it gonna die? Probably not anytime soon because there are courses and degrees offered and people still take it as a profession/passion. Also, there are people who still attend Kacheris ( carnatic equivalent of a concert?) and support the same. As a result of the traditions and culture of musical schools moving away from the caste restrictions that were once in place, everyone's got access to music classes these days so it's flourishing behind the scenes of TV or the big screens. \n\nFun fact: It's the Divine composer and guru Tyagaraja's 250th birth anniversary this month and he has played a pivotal role in the musical history of India."

"Punjabi music is the staple in creating musical artist. The industry is really a success story.\n\nBut other music is out there too, just gotta find it. [Prateek Kuhad's indie music is something I've been following over the years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ol5mxtxhVI), [recent release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BpDVIv_860)"
"There were independent artists coming up with albums all the time in 90's. But the timing was wrong. There were no streaming services and almost everyone used to pirate all the time. No one was interested in buying an entire album for those two songs you liked. There was no chance for these artists to survive. Bollywood music survived it because music wasn't their primary source of income.\n\nThings are bit better these days with many streaming services which cost very less even for an average college student. The whole album thing might start again."
"So in short there is not much Independent music scene in India. There are few good indie bands but nothing special. Please comment if know certain bands that should be heard (there was a scheduled thread on randia about indie music, don't know what happened to it).      \nMaking money as an artist is a necessity. But i feel somehow supply of good artists Is also less. So artistically too we lack originality and feel to produce good music, coz in todays age if something is good it will definitely find its way to right audience.  **So key Is to make good music**. What i mostly hear as Indian indie artists are a bunch of rich college kids playing death metal or people producing Jal band type music.           \nYou can always argue that there is no audience. But i don't think that's the case. Even 0.001% of Indian population is a big number. Plus using digital medium you can reach international audience too.     \nAbout making money as an indie artist; touring, partnering with streaming services, branding etc can be monetizing channels.      \nSo in short good music needs to be made first then money and popularity should automatically flow. And it doesn't take much(monetary-wise) to make a good song and publishing on youtube. Clearly we are lacking in this. \n   "
"Perhaps you guys can be more of optimists and listen to fresh and original INDIAN talent of Parekh and Singh [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp_0GThdZDQ)\n\nThey are rising in fame and their song Ghost was featured on Elton John's beats 1 show.\n\nI am a fan of Indian classical music, and I find that it is way more accessible and gaining popularity now than before, and I am not an Indian or in India.\n\nAlso, dissing bollywood won't help anyone. \n\n\n"
"This seems more like a problem with the music categorisation at on that website. I personally love the 'Dev Anand' playlist. He acted in a certain kind of movies which had a certain kind of music. Similarly there might be people who like SRK kind of songs, irrespective of who the musician/singer is. \n\nCelebrity name sells things across the world. If Hollywood had as many musicals then Spotify would also have similar playlists I guess. \n\n**Edit**: [Here is a Marlon Brando music playlist](https://8tracks.com/explore/marlon_brando/popular/1). Hollywood would have more of these if most of their films were musicals, with lead actors performing the song on camera.  "
"I don't see the problem with this. These are just playlists. These are just used for categorization. The songs sung by every singer is on the page for the singer. These are just playlists which only contain the songs picturized on the actor on the cover.\n\nFor example: I would like to listen to the SRK one specifically because it has many good songs sung by Abhijeet, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Shaan, etc.\n\n\nTL;DR: There is nothing wrong with this IMO. It is just a goddamn playlist, not albums.\n\nEDIT: Apparently you are downvoted for your opinions now. Fine."

'>Image over everything else.  \n\nWhy else do you think some of the youtube Indian musicians are famous, when they autotune the shit out of their songs? Because they look fuckable\n\n'
'Farhan Akhtar is the best singer we have in India.'
'There used to be a time when Indian music was more than Bollywood. If you look at Lucky Ali, Sony Nigam, Shaan, Alisha Chinai and many other artists who did the whole "private album" thing. I don\'t know what happened; either we stopped buying them or the music company decided that making bollywood music is more profitable.'
">I hate how Indian music is mostly centered around bollywood. Artists and bands scene hasn't really taken off.\n\nYep, the incident of Arijit Singh publicly apologizing to Salman Khan was an eye opener for me. It's funny how actors thought it wasn't enough to take credit for the artists' songs so they decided to try their hands at singing, and still haven't realised they suck at it."
"lol didn't think I will enjoy a korean show on india so much thanks for sharing"
"It's ironic considering I have seen randians defend their piracy on the sub and complain about this which needs some sort of incentive. Luckily with emergence of Gaana and Saavn kinda services and people exploring these subscription based services, it may be easier to provide artists incentives. "
"Dude, vocalists and composers are just as well recognised. It's the instrumentalists who very little recognition."
"> The Indi music scene which was picking up pace in the 90s and early 2000s was clobbered and hijacked by the Indian film industry.\n\nNope. The film industry has been around forever. Indie scene died because of the unprecedented scale of piracy enabled by CDs. \n\nBefore people started filling up CDs with music spanning decades, there was a culture of buying an audio cassette of an artist you really like. People used to pirate in the days of audio cassettes too, but the cost of buying a new blank cassette and recording music on it was not much lower than buying it legally, and both had about the same storage capacity. But then CDs came along and a 10 rupee CD could hold pirated music worth ~INR 3000 market value. That's when everyone gave up on buying music. It also didn't help that music companies overpriced CDs for a good amount of time. Established acts don't rely on music sales but upcoming talent does and it all dried out over time."
"I don't know much except anecdotal evidence but the singers are pretty well known around me. However the fame is centred around very few movie singers like Arijit Singh. Not nearly as open for newbs as a regular music industry I'd imagine"
'If they get too vocal. Lol . Pun intended ?'
"Eh, you just can't straight away dismiss bollywood. Quite a few good songs came out because of bollywood. I haven't been much into bollywood movies for some years, but even then it still has some legibility left because of some good artists and actors. Yeah, but some good artists get left out in the shadow just cause they couldn't make it in bollywood. Indian people are very much into mainstream in almost everything, so it also has also a lot to do with people's taste and exposure for entertainment."
"so public wants to listen to songs categorized by actors and not by musicians . Yes it's perfectly alright."
"Thats fine. But where is non-movie music?That's the question "
">This seems more like a problem with the music categorisation at on that website.     \n\nNo it's about what role music plays in Indian context. Movies, actors come first then music. So people(like you are a fan of Dev Anand's music even though he wasn't a musician) associate music with Movies and actors, rather than music for its own sake.    \nEarlier India too had band cultures(Lucky ali, Euphoria, Indian Ocean) but most died down because of so much money pumped into Bollywood.     \nIn west this isn't the case as their movies don't have songs like Bollywood. They appreciate music for it's own sake not because it was shot with a particular actor on screen(which really is a **dumb** way to appreciate music).          \nIndians' infatuation with movie music is killing the music for music sake, which actually should be much bigger than Movie music."
'I agree with you 100%. This is exactly what I want to say.'
"Ok. So Where are the independent albums ?     \nAnyway i think bollywood got you. They made you believe that music belongs to movies and doesn't have value in itself. People like you are partly responsible for death of band culture.     \n\n>For example: I would like to listen to the SRK one specifically because it has many good songs sung by Abhijeet, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Shaan, etc.\n\nI find this thought process uncomfortable and appalling. How can you attribute quality of songs to an actor? Its really **dumb** way to appreciate music.  \n\n\n   "

'I think Anu Malik is the best singer. '
"Although, I too listen to some Punjabi music (Gurdas Mann, Satinder Sartaaj,  and other known ones in tidbits), but majority of the Punjabi music (95%) is crap and repititive too. There are good musicians, I agree, but they are handful. Live music scene even though fills the arenas is an utter crapfest with bad orchestra, sound design, and the original singer that sounds like a noob singing live.\n\nThe only Hindi independent music sans Bollywood was Jagjit Singh's Ghazals, but they too died with his demise unfortunately.\n\n90s gave us many Pop hits. Baba Sehgal, Lucky Ali, Silk Road are still active but not producing anything qualitative anymore. 90s were the golden era of pop.\n"
"That's because a large portion of their fans are like me people of Indian origin. Most of us would rather see them perform the song over the actor lip singing their music and a lot of it is folk music with a big bass so the market is pretty niche. \n\nI remember the when I first found out that Indian movie stars don't sing their songs. Mind fucking blown, my gf recently found this out her reaction was pretty funny albeit she was quite sad. "
'Rock and metal is popular in Bangalore and North East. But ofc, EDM is taking over. '
"Not much. North Eastern part has a very strong scene of rock and metal. You can still find some rock bands playing in the major cities. For the rest of the country -- it's mostly college bands who stop playing after they leave college and get a job."
"> I remember when rock was very popular around 2000.\n\nI guess EDM is big now, though I don't know how you would measure the popularity. Rock music's death has been predicted ever since the Beatles."
"Good point. Some of the  top-tier Indian musicians also get to tour the west and make some $$s \n\nI've been to sold out SPB and AR Rehman concerts in the US and middle-east !"
"Music is not a very high paying job \n\nVery few people actually make money of it \n\nAnd whatever artists do get successful there is no guarantee that they'll remain popular \n\nIt's a very cut throat, highly competitive business \n\nBollywood provides some stability to these guys"
"Exactly! Not sure what everyone is talking about. Playback singers like Lata, Yesudas, Sony Nigam, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan, Alka are extremely well respected and known. As for why Indian bands arent popular, it doesn't help that most of them choose to sing in English these days, you can't expect masses to appreciate or care."

"What? I remember a case being filed in Maharashtra against criticism of Sonia Gandhi right before election.

Throw some free sarees and drinks along the way. My alignment leans to the left between less of a joke and somewhat a joke. \n\nHere\'s an optimistic idea first, start teaching children how to take criticism in the school itself, I\'ve noticed a lot of people in the country get offended too easily, like I saw a Tamilian on youtube who started insulting firangs for asking "WTF are they speaking" over a hollywood movie dubbed in Tamil. Modi and his supporters are similar. Our general society is similar, try saying shit about Shivaji to a generic Maharastrian. \n\nHave you ever noticed a lot of jokes flying over peoples heads in this sub? Indians lack a sense of humour unless you play a twing tink sponk sound after every joke.

City Skylines fans attack anyone who says shit about that game despite the developers doing the same corrupt practices EA gets called out for.\n\nApple Inc. had the same thing at one point. It is a Cult! Long story short Apple knew their audience was brainless.\n\nModi is curating himself, he knows how gullible majority of the population is. See how movie stars are worshipped?

"Because BJP knows the power of the people's anger. They have seen what hubris can do. They know how Indians kicked the mighty congress out after 60+ years.

Hence, Congress would never be such dicks.\n\nBJP, though, can't help but fuck up and then can't help but fuck up some more to cover up the previous fuck up."
"To be honest, it's just because of the false equivalence in your question: \n\n\n1) Sonia/Rahul are pathetic excuses for politicians that would never even have come to prominence without their family name.\n2) Considering the quality of politicians in India, Modi is at least above average no matter how critically you look at him. Maybe not the best, but still better than a Mayawati, Mamata Banerjee or a Karunanidhi.  \n\n\nYet, they both receive a similar level of flak. Obviously the right feels that the flak Modi gets is not proportional to what Sonia/Rahul should get. "

And those who actually followed have selective memory due to recency bias. \n\nOfftopic but it's hilarious how Kejriwal fanbais are now orgasming over Rahul when it was Congress which hounded Kejriwal during IAC movement and it was BJP which supported him. The only reason Kejriwal turned against BJP was because Congress was a sinking ship and Modi was getting all the limelight. Not because Kejriwal stands for secularism. If Rahul or Sonia was as cultish and popular as Modi Kejriwal would have turned against Congress. He just needed a tougher opponent to get the limelight. "

"Wow! I'm going there next month too! Mind sharing your experience?"
"Don't forget to mention the natural hot spring, I peaked there !"
'I was planning to go there this week. All my friends bailed out on me. Next year maybe. Breathtaking view btw op. 😍'
'Is this the same place where my friends told *maal accha milta hai*?'
'Sure is a good place. Where did you trek to kheerganga from, if I may ask ?'
"Hi. Mind sharing your experience? Like how easy or difficult was it? And maybe any helpful tips? I'm going there next month."
"Well actually there are couple of makeshift bathrooms (if you can call it that) you can do your business. Though if I recall, only one out of four of those bathrooms had water. I can't say for everyone, but I relieved myself in the woods. Nothing like shitting in deep jungle is what my grandfather always used to say."
'> Mind sharing your experience?\n\nCharas '
"Hahah I can't believe I left out the hot springs. They were one of the best things out there."
'Go alone? single trip?\n\nI do it even if friends bail on me. much better way to chat up with locals and strangers.'
'Hey. So I trekked up to kheerganga from kalga, the distance being 9.6 kms. It took us a bit more than three hours including all the time we took to smoke or take photos and stuff like that. The trek itself was a bit treacherous, but not that difficult and totally worth it once you reach kheerganga. And I can honestly say I had the most rad time in kheerganga. To me it felt like those hippie communes that reside on the middle of nowhere. And the amount of stars we saw out there at night honestly blew us away. '
"It was a great experience, it can be experienced great high or not, \n\n\nTake as much as you can to eat packed stuff is like double the mrp. The food is expensive but tasty. Also on limited quantities. It's easier to start but difficult to end. \n\n\nBuy stuff in the village inbetween eat apples they are good, have winter wear it's necessary. As for next month it will almost be brutal. \n\n\n\n"
"Wow! I feel like going there right now!\nSo, you stayed up there at night? Did you take tents with you? Or are those available there?\nAnd speaking about the trek, how steep was the slope in general? \nSorry, this'll be my first trek, that's why pretty curious about it!"
'Thanks for the suggestion, buddy!\nYes, we do intend to take enough winter wear with us! And speaking of the food, how expensive is it, for a general idea? I mean, we are too thinking about taking food with us, but traveling light is necessary too.'
"Thanks for the education though I knew all of that already. But I do appreciate your concern, I'll think about it the next time I shit in the woods. "
'Kalga and Pulga are two places I keep going back to. Lovely places.'
'It\'s quite alright, mate, happy to help. No we didn\'t take any tents, they are available there in abundance. But if you want a good all-round view, I suggest you opt for "lonely planet tents" which is where we stayed at. We stayed there 3 nights I think. And the slope was a bit steep, yes, but nothing that can\'t be climbed by first timers such as yourself. Just make sure you get yourself a bit fit physically before going on the trip.'
'Any packaged stuff is sold on twice the mrp. \n\n\nKeep food low on volume but good nutrition, or increase your budget for food. '
"Really appreciate the help, buddy!\nCan you explain a bit what exactly is this lonely planet tent? How many people can stay in one and how much does it cost? I'm going with 2 of my friends and probably will be staying for one night up there.\nAnd would you suggest to travel light? Because we were initially thinking about taking tents by ourselves.\nAnd also did you take food with you? 3 nights seem a long time, that's why.\nAgain, thanks for the help!"
"From tosh it's like 6 to 7 hours there are a few shops in between. And easy and difficult routes at some places \n\n\nIt takes like 3 hours just walking down the trek "
"Yeah it was nice back then. Especially kalga was very peaceful. In fact I remember they were building a road from kalga to the valley below.\n\nI don't know how it is now though I hope they haven't commercialised it too much, at least places like kheerganga are pure and should be kept that way."
'Well if you guys must know, I did my business with a bottle of water and a whole lot of toilet paper. Better than doing it in those crampy-ass toilets they have there.'
"Thanks, mate!\nIs the food that's available up there good and affordable? Also, if there's a lot of tents there, does that mean it remains fairly crowded by travellers?"
"Trim your nails dude. It is not a good idea to go on trek with long nails.

'Happy Onam Everyone !\n\nLets celebrate the fond memories of our great Dravidian heritage before the Vamana (Aka Fair skinned Aryan) came and tricked our Noble King Mahabali (Dark skinned Asura ) into exile and fucked up our culture for good ...\n\nHere is the traditional Onam song reminiscing about our past :\n> maveli nadu vaneedum kalam\n\n> manusharellarum onnupole\n\n> amodhathode vasikkum kalam\n\n> apathangarkkumottillathanum\n\n> kallavum illa chathiyumilla\n\n> ellolamilla polivachanam\n\n> kallapparayum cherunazhiyum\n\n> kallatharangal mattonnumilla\n\n> adhikal vyadhikalonnumilla\n\n> balamaranangal kelppanilla \n\n\n**Translation** :\n\n> When Maveli (Mahabali), our King, ruled the land,\n\n> All the people were equal.\n\n> And people were joyful and merry;\n\n> They were all free from harm.\n\n> There was neither anxiety nor sickness,\n\n> Deaths of children were unheard of,\n\n> There were no lies,\n\n> There was neither theft nor deceit,\n\n> And no one was false in speech either.\n\n> Measures and weights were right;\n\n>  No one cheated or wronged his neighbor.\n\n> When Maveli, our King, ruled the land,\n\n> All the people formed **one casteless race**'
'well played (read forwarded).'
'ok gross!\n'
'Happy onam to Everyone '
'you saar, have a great sense of humour :D have a banana on my behalf too'
"Oh I get it. It's funny coz it's racist."
'Good eye.'
'Yes. We love all our bananas equally, more so during onam.'
"It's a Hindu festival(Source: Wikipedia). But celebrated across religions by Malayalis. "
'Ah yes, I am sure the Aryan and Dravidian divide existed during the time of the gods. '
"Onam is a Hindu festival (but celebrated by all religions but Christians and Muslims don't partake in the liturgical parts of it) but Eid is a Muslim festival. The Eid bananas have their tips cut off, just like a circumcised penis 😬Muslim men are circumcised. "
'You clearly don\'t know the meaning "race".'
'He/She means that Onam is a festival in Kerala that is celebrated across religious lines.'
'The Muslims & Christian stay out of the more \'religios\' rituals. But they all partake in the Onam fest, traditional dresses etc . Many christians put "pookkalam" (flower rangoli) out their houses too. \n\nThe real success of Onam IMHO is that whenever it is celebrated in the public space (schools, colleges, offices or outside events) all the communities participate. The festival has been successfully integrated into all communities over centuries. '
'It is celebrated by everyone irrespective of religion here. Liturgical stuffs are limited with Hindus though. '
'Onam is not directly connected to hindu mythology. Its more of a "harvest festival" that was written into modern hinduism .\n\nIf you follow hindu mythology , Vamana avatar comes before Parasurama . But in Kerala mythology Kerala was created by Parasurama, which was later ruled by Mahabali, who was exiled by Vamana ! There are glaring inconsistencies in that timeline, unless Parasurama was sent by skynet into the past or something.  \n\nThe onam myth is more or less some sort of pointer to a time before the arrival of the fairer skinned rulers in South India, who banished the local kings and introduced the  caste system and all the bells and whistles. That is why I posted the damn song. We\'ve been singing that since time immemorial . '
'Interesting, because Christians and Muslims are generally prohibited from the "Pagan festivals".\n\nWell, atleast good for you. You have achieved some degree of Syncretism.'
"Good to hear that the Christians and Muslims in Kerala haven't let their religious commandments come in the way of brotherhood. [Unlike other places...](http://www.republicworld.com/s/6131/farhan-akhtar-called-out-for-posting-a-picture-of-lord-ganesha-on-instagram)"
'From the Wikipedia article on it:\n\n> The festival is also celebrated by Christians of Kerala, in its churches.\n\n> The festival has been declared as wrong and forbidden for Muslims (Haram) by Islamic preachers'
'> Onam is not directly connected to hindu mythology. Its more of a "harvest festival" that was written into modern hinduism .\n\nInteresting. In that regard, similar to Christmas in Christianity. '
'Vaisakhi in Punjab is also a harvest festival. It has been celebrated for centuries but has been integrated into Sikhism and Hinduism only recently.'
"That happened because the Kerala  Christian and Muslim communities were here since 6th and 8th centuries. **They mostly lived with very little influence from the outside Muslim/Christian world to tell them what to do or not to do** . They shared far more customs alongside the hindus in the past. Especially the older christian communities, who were upper caste converts. These christians even followed untouchability like the UC hindus. !\n\n The Portuguese arrived in 15th century and integrated a lot of these Christians into European centralized religious authority, so they outlawed many of the 'pagan' like rituals and shared customs.\n\nThe muslims too started withdrawing from shared culture due to the increase in middle eastern influence post the oil boom.  "
'The christians who celebrate it inside the churches are the Syrian/Malankara christians who were the 1st christian group in India, who have existed from 8th century AD. \n\nThe have borrowed a lot of customs from UC hindus culture of the time, as they always had Upper Caste status in Kerala society. Most of these early christian converts were from upper castes , so they took their caste privileges and many customs with them into the new religion. \n\nMuslims are a bit more divided on celebrating onam. Many conservative sects have banned it, but Muslims generally participate in the onam feast. \n\n'
'Onam is an amalgamation of the traditional harvest festival and the hindu legend of Vamana and Mahabali. \n\n'

"I said this in the other thread too. Media plays a significant role in democracy. Yes, LS majority means current government can pass whatever it wants as a money bill. But media could have created a ruckus before it. But the news cycle was captured by elections and other things that followed it. I am willing to consider that it was planned. \n\nThey have exercised this before in the form of Aadhaar and it was only the start it seems.\n\nCan't wait to see the bills that pass when thus government gets RS majority too. \n\nMedia please step up :(\n\nEven now there are only a handful news entities that are covering it.

"That's not where my logic comes from. The finance bill 2017 enables any political party to receive unlimited and undisclosed money from corporations. The limit was 7.5%of the net profit of the last 3 years and they also had to disclose the money given to political parties to their share holder. So basically you have legalised unlimited political contributions. They will now be able to influence the legislation and no one knowing which is cronyism. This is why they are crooked who ran on development and non corruption agenda. That's why I said that they are corrupt and not the damn media reporting."

"Day by day everyone is getting quieter and kind of just accepting whatever is going on as their fate, if the public doesn't wake up now, it's going to be too late. The media has to play a role in it but so many of them are already sold that it's now on the viewer to be alert. \n\n\nBut at the same time, I totally believe that if things go extreme south, our public will stand up on their own. It's a matter of time. No idea how south is south enough for them, but at the same time you just hope that things don't scramble down any further."
'Nice false equivalency. The (s)election of a religious bigot as the CM of the biggest Indian state are huge news. And your dismissal of France and the UK as "colonial rulers", despite neither of them having an Empire for over 50 years, is vile as the implication is that they somehow deserve being killed.\n\nThat your comment gets upvoted says a lot about a substantial minority in the sub willing to traffic in bigotry and/or downplay it when it comes from the Sangh(Yogi). \n\nAnd the SS story is important because it shows how the VIP culture of MLAs is alive and well in India.

"It's the best! I think Indian express is also good. The point of the matter is that the news people get out of Facebook or the social media can be accused of click bait tactics.

The other problem seems to be people being more interested in sensational news than the boring politics."

"Did you think that the people of Qatar or the US or Russia or UK or China somehow care more? Yet their respective channels and media put out high quality research pieces.

There is this amazing site I use for info re bills called prsindia.org, but it's text heavy, how many people will even verify what they read by spending 30 mins on the site?"
'Thank you for prsindia.org'
"I am not disagreeing with you,  you're right,  but this issue is actually a lot bigger than people caring. There are structural problems (I'm sure you know how difficult is it to set up a news channel in India without backing of someone big,  hence corruption or fraud media),  our population is mostly uneducated (I very thoroughly dislike the way Modi and amit shah etc deliver speeches,  but this is what works In India). So the ability to understand more sophisticated news pieces is also in question. And Most of our media *is* utter shit.\n\nI remember listening this on radio while driving,  'we are promised the world before elections but after,  we're distracted with relatively irrelevant issues to divert attention from what actually matters, the cycle repeats'.  I think it was said in relation to beef or something (at least that was the hot topic then) but it seems true otherwise too. "
"Point is,  it takes bigger effort and investment to take an initiative like that seriously than publishing an article and the forces against such serious journalism that actually has an impact (given the click bait this channel favors this party culture  Indian media has)  are too strong. Having said that,  there *are* few journalists here who do take journalism (and it's ethics) seriously. "

None of this is true, which therefore brings into question the very utility of Aadhaar, as also the unforeseen complications it may cause.\n\n[Four Reasons You Should Worry About Aadhaar’s Use of Biometrics](https://thewire.in/119323/real-problem-aadhaar-lies-biometrics/)\n\nIts not without reason that UK scrapped such a project; Australia could never implement it and USA is yet to implement the Real ID Act of 2005.\n\n"

If it's the first case, we'll have to assume the hero and his family thinks he's worthless and somehow got into a lower tier NIT and there's no way he got into Andhra NIT. That could also be a source of angst once the switch is revealed."

"Warangal is in Telangana now. Can't really call it NIT-AP anymore.\n\nThat said, maybe the one in Andhra is called NIT Tadipallegudem, and the one in Arunachal is called NIT-AP?

"Thats a really bad practice imo, farmers can't indluge in reckless behavious and then expect the government to bail them out everytime, you just cannot use suicide as a bargaining chip."
'Like the public has a choice'
'Because it is still a BJP government and fits right in with their ideology of grand symbolism and doing nothing on real problems.'
"if he didn't agree to it why is he inaugurating it? taking credits is ok but taking responsibility hmm"
"I think this statue is a stupid idea, however it is extremely distatsteful that non-maharashtrians think they can tell maharashtrians what to do and not to do. Lutyens supremacism imo, this statue is a collosal waste of money, but if Maharashtrians want it then let them have it, Maharashtra isn't New Delhi's colony, you cannot treat them as your slaves, by extracting billions in taxes from them and then siphoning them elsewhere. Maharashtra has paid the cost of this statue to the rest of India many times over in the form of revenue.\n\nThat said, there's many Maharashtrians that oppose this move (me included), there's no sure way of judging if we're the majority. However, Shivaji is a god figure here and most maharashtrians here (esp marathas) would be supportive of these shenanigans. Regardless, respect Maharashtra's autonomy and it's people's right to decide for themselves."
"Public Idolize Maharaj, If you built the statues you will get their support. \nBuild more statues, change more names and they will start admiring you... Simple man, that's how it works in India"

'hey _dexter! I think I had spoken to you quite sometime back. How you doing man? :)\n\nAs for this modi topic, dude you used to be good at reasoning what I remember. You\'re speaking quite passively here. Anyway, I think if he makes a statement against the statue then the politicians  / media will highlight him as anti-shivaji or anti-national and make sensational news about it. There will be state level protests since Shivaji is god to them. They even renamed the international airport recently to "Maharaj" CST.'
'That no is for a political reason. But in this case, this "yes" is about the "religious sentiments" and kulcha. You know how shiv sena politicizes Shivaji right? I know what you mean about disapproval for that money and agree for it. I wish that he could have done it. But looking at the kind of political + sentimental situation I don\'t see any way to disapprove of it.\n\nBesides, it\'s the State govt\'s funds. How they choose to spend it depends upon how the State govt chooses it by law.'
"I understand your reasoning and you're right. He can't publicly disapprove of it. But that doesn't mean he has to do something to show support for the statue. \n\nDid they publicly call him for the inauguration? "
'> You know how shiv sena politicizes Shivaji right?\n\nYep, like how Modiji politicized Sardar Patel.'

'Oh definitely. I have separate pics of the cloud altitude. They were definitely white. '
'People love to create drama out of nothing, especially in India! Banning notes is okay but banning crackers is "judicial overreach".'
"They did follow odd-even for cars last year. India is not US. We're the world's most polluted. Every step helps. Last years data has shown during Diwali, pollution in Delhi reaches most deadly levels! It's a good step. Period."
'are you aware that US is 3 times larger than india in terms of land area and 1/4th in terms of population size?         \n\n\n\n\nlet me simplify:           \nindia is like 100 people bursting crackers in a 2 BHK apartment         \nUSA is like 25 people bursting crackers in a  6 BHK apartment'
'What do you mean by most deadly? Did it result in alarmingly more deaths than the non-Diwali periods?\nI am not saying firecrackers don\'t cause pollution. But the measures to tackle the Delhi pollution aren\'t enough at all. And stopping firecrackers isn\'t going to help reduce the massive levels of smoke that already exist. Because the percentage share of firecrackers in the overall pollution isn\'t much.\nEvery bit doesn\'t help. You can try taking out a bucket of water from the sea, you won\'t end up drying out the sea. To do that you need more that "bits and pieces".'

'Dear friend...\nairhelp.com is the best website to compensate your losses, they take airlines to the court and fight for you, just check whether your flight is covered with them or not...\nHope it helps...'
'All airlines overbook. It is a standard practice. Remember half empty flights in the 80s, 90s and even early 2000s? Do you see of that these days?\n\nAt this point airlines have a very good idea how many no-shows there will be and overbook to that extent. On the times that there are fewer no-shows, they figure there will be someone who will take their incentives, typically a free ticket in the future in exchange for taking the next flight. '
'That\'s odd -- I was on an overbooked Jet flight out of BOM last week. I am a JP member but was traveling with my sister, who is not. The check in agent more or less told me that they were going to "release seats" to make sure my sister and I got on.\n'
'What do you guys think is a fair compensation in such a case?Obviously, it would depend on the circumstances of the traveller. \n\nI think I would be happy with a compensation of an extra free flight at my choice upto a maximum amount (say 10,000 bucks)'
"I am a JP member and going by all these posts, I must be the only one who has never had any problems with them. In fact, it has been so good that I haven't bothered trying other airlines maybe Vistara I'll try next).\n\nI use them for domestic and international and never had any problems.\n\nAs far as overbooking goes, every airline in the world does it. Airlines by itself are very low profit margin business, so it's expected. It's also a business where customer literally wants to be treated like a king. Also, if you don't want to get bumped off your flight, do web check-in. If you can afford to fly, you can probably afford a smartphone. And you can use even a low end Android to check-in.\n\nAm surprised that a customer enrolled for frequent flyer isn't using web check-in."
'> airhelp.com\n\nUnfortunately, this flight is not eligible for compensation.\n\nWe’re currently **only able to help with flights covered by European or US laws**. We’re working hard to expand our service to more jurisdictions and hope to be able to help with your region soon'
'Thanks for the link. Gonna keep it bookmarked.'
'TIL. Thank you. '
'Yeah the hello 6E was really cheez. '
"> What Jet is doing is clearly illegal.\n\nIt's not. Every airline in the world probably does it, at least for the economy seats."
'> What Jet is doing is clearly illegal\n\nNo, there are DGCA guidelines for the compensation. It is part and parcel of air travel, though some airlines choose not to do it'
"Not everyone selects seats beforehand. Also if you're really late, your seat can be reassigned. But yes, if you select seats in advance you have a low chance of being booted."
'"Release seats" ... does that mean other people who weren\'t JP members got kicked off?'
'Everyone does, hence not illegal.  \nOkay'
"This is a clear case of a contract being broken. So, it is illegal. You need basic knowledge of law to know that. Having said that, if you agreed to take a later flight or benefits for whatever reason, it is perfectly legal. Which is why, most airlines ensure that the person who is forgoing the seat is willingly doing so.\n\nIf you don't allow a person in despite him/her not agreeing to your offers of compensation and different flight, the airline's action is illegal."
"They always give some cash/kind compensation, and the flight you do catch is at no extra charge, of course.\n\nI've never been pushed off a flight by any Indian carrier, but when it happens with a foreign carrier, it's a fucking bonanza. I was traveling for work, so I couldn't take up the offer, but once out of LHR I was offered something like £400 and a comped stay at a five star if I took the same flight the next day. feelsbadman.png\n\nMy uncle once delayed his return from holiday by a week, because every time he showed up to check in, they shoved money at him to leave. He ended up traveling on the final day only because his kids got fed up with the ordeal!\n\n\nEDIT: the issue in India would appear to be that the compensation is a pittance. INR 2270 is a gas, particularly if one is traveling for work."
"This is what is typically done abroad.   \n\nIf someone cannot be boarded airline offers him compensation - i.e. board the next flight + get a free ticket or some money. If the guy accepts it, then it's fine. Else they start auctioning the benefits among the remaining passengers who are going to be boarded - i.e. anyone who wants to give up their ticket will get some cash + next flight. If no one, accepts, then cash is increased. This keeps going till someone accepts and everyone is happy."
'Legality does not depend on whether you like it. There is not law against it (not in India, anyway), therefore it is legal.'
'[No contract has been broken](http://www.jetairways.com/doc/jetairwayscustomerserviceplans.pdf),\n\n[Some more](http://www.jetairways.com/en/in/termsandconditions/general.aspx),\n\n>>To reduce the possibility of flight departing with unoccupied or empty seats, the airlines overbook flights to a limited extent. In such overbooking cases, an airline may have more guests reporting for a particular flight than the seats available on such flight and as such, may need to deny the boarding to some of the guests.\n\nIn the above event, before denying the boarding, Jet Airways would endeavour to first ask volunteers to give up their seats so as to make such seats available for other booked guests to travel on the flight. In return, Jet Airways, at its own discretion, would offer to the volunteer such benefits / facilities which, it may wish to offer.\n\nJet Airways shall not be liable to pay any compensation in case an alternate flight is arranged by the airline that is scheduled to depart within one hour of the original schedule departure time of the initial reservation.\n\nA] In case you are denied boarding involuntarily on a flight for which you hold a confirmed reservation, you are entitled to the following monetary compensation:\n\na) If an alternate flight is offered which is scheduled to depart within 24 hours of the original booked scheduled departure, the guest is entitled to 200% of the booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel surcharge, subject to maximum compensation of INR 10,000.\n\nb) If an alternate flight is offered which is scheduled to depart more than 24 hours of the original booked scheduled departure, the guest is entitled to 400% of the booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel surcharge, subject to maximum compensation of INR 20,000.\n\nc) If the guest does not opt for an alternate flight, the guest is entitled to a refund of the full value of the ticket in addition to 400% of the booked one-way basic fare plus airline fuel surcharge, subject to maximum compensation of INR 20,000.'
">  I was traveling for work, so I couldn't take up the offer, but once out of LHR I was offered something like £400 and a comped stay at a five star if I took the same flight the next day.\n\nLol My friend got a free 2 way economy travel out of it from LAX - BOM. Emirates did that to him once when he was in Dubai. They offered free hotel stay, business upgrade for the next flight out of Dubai and a free return economy from US to India. He felt like he was cheating the airlines or something.\n\n"
'It is not illegal. So it is legal.  \nOkay.'
"If i'm not mistaken it's [this] (http://indianexpress.com/article/trending/bizarre/kerala-man-attends-his-marriage-online-from-saudi-arabia-after-he-failed-to-get-leaves-4411364/) \n"
'No idea about specifics -- I am pulling the 2270 figure from the poem in the OP. \n\nEDIT: DGCA website is pretty clear - http://www.dgca.nic.in/kyrdgca/pdf/Delay-Cancellation-&-Denied-Boarding/D3M-M4.pdf \n\nDepending on where this guy was going, it looks like INR 2270 was a lowball by Jet.'
"It's a bribe. You can sue them for a breach of contract but since you have signed the form you have basically relieved the airline of any liabilities."
"Well, that's how a legal system works. Laws more or less declare certain behaviours and activities unlawful, and the courts or police enforce them. Everything else is considered legal. \n\nIf we were to do the opposite, the first law you'd need to get passed would be one that legalised breathing.\n"
'Yep. Just saw a link. Looks like they are offering prescribed compensation for not allowing to board on the flight.\n\nAt this juncture, I can only question DGCA as the compensation for forcing someone out of a flight for pure commercial reasons looks too low.'
"The compensations are better world-wide. Ideally, the fine should be punitive and the airlines should be allowed to fix compensation with the passengers directly. That's how free markets are supposed to work.\n\nBy ensuing a pittance of a compensation, you have empowered airlines to screw the passengers. "
'A very sensible comment. Despite what the media or our political leaders would like us to believe, India has not arrived at the world stage. Our economy is still small, especially compared to our population strength, and our contribution to global trade, tourism, R&D, innovation etc, is rather insignificant.'
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Let India grow at 8-10% for 10 years before chest-thumping: Raghuram Rajan** \n\n ______ \nWith India trailing China on economic growth post demonetisation, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has said the government should not have done "chest-thumping" on being the fastest-growing economy without achieving very strong GDP expansion for 10 years.\n\nIn an interview , he said India can lecture the world on things such as culture and history, but on growth, it should do that only after achieving 8-10 per cent rate for 10 years.\n\nRajan, the only central bank governor in two decades who did not get a second term, courted controversy when in April last year he had called rising India a one-eyed king in the land of blind. BJP Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy had then called for his sacking, saying he was "mentally not fully Indian".\n\nRefusing to comment on Swamy\'s remarks, Rajan said his comment was taken out of context.\n\n"Not that I was forecasting anything, I was merely saying we have to be a little cautious about being too bullish about ourselves. That remark was made in April 2016, every quarter since then, our growth has fallen. So, I would argue in hindsight, and I didn\'t have any reason to believe that would be the case, but caution was warranted," he maintained.\n\nIndia\'s GDP growth slowed to 5.7 per cent in April-June this year, down from 6.1 per cent in preceding three months. China clocked 6.5 per cent growth rate in both the quarters.\n\nHe said the pace of expansion needs to pick up to 8 per cent or 9 per cent with higher private investment and revival in exports.\n\n"There are so many other things that we can lecture the rest of the world -- cultural achievements, historical achievements etc, but on growth, let us lecture once we have achieved another 10 years of 8-10 per cent," he advised.\n\nAn 8-10 per cent growth for 10 years would be an extraordinary achievement, but that is the growth rate needed for 10 years to reach the level of middle income, he stressed.\n\n"We have done ever since the 1990s on and off 6-7-8 per cent. We need a couple of percentages more on that for 10 years and then, we will be a much bigger economy," he said. "We should not go chest-thumping. I would prefer that we establish another 10 years of very strong growth of 8-10 per cent."\n\nRajan, who had predicted the 2008 global financial crisis, said Indian economy still is very small at USD 2.5 trillion, but "we feel we are a big country."\n\nChina is five times India\'s size.\n\nStating that India and China are not paired anymore, he said in order to be paired, China has to slow down and India has to grow at a rapid pace for the next 10 years.\n\n"Then, people will see us in a more serious light," said Rajan, who was governor of the central bank from September 4, 2013, to September 4, 2016.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"> The INC was established with the goal of upstanding, typically western educated intellectuals leading the country forward. \n\nMost of the early congress was regressive and Sanghi.Nehru wasn't the only one in the Congress."
"Sadly, this is very likely to happen. Ultimately though - a lot of times prime ministers are just a politically correct face of an organization or ideology. Modi isn't really some sort of charismatic benevolent dictator or a despotic all-powerful King - he's the PR face of the Sangh, and business interests that support the incumbent BJP government. The latter probably keeps the more hateful agendas of the Sangh in check.\n\nMoving away from a bureaucracy/technocracy is inevitable in a country like India the moment populism rises, but it is always going to be damaging."

'Greeks and Egyptians didn\'t have the concept of "place-valued" system. They came up with different symbols for 10, 100, 1000, etc. Not unlike the Romans. It\'s not inventing the symbols to represent numbers that was the huge achievement. Anyone can come up with random scribbles and call it their own numeral system. The point is, the Indian system gave a way to represent any number with just 10 characters in a reasonable amount of space.'
"I think the ship has long sailed, there's literally no chance that we will ever see cities like Chinese megapolises in the next 30-40 years.

It's actually quite depressing to see how far behind India is.\n\nEven very small cities like Kunming are light years ahead."
'Yeah '
'India has nothing that corresponds to fiscal conservatism - this is an inevitability because 90% of the population is essentially in poverty by the standards of any developed country. Congress and BJP have virtually identical economics. The CPM is fiscally much further to the left, but look at how many states in India they control right now - it\'s called a failed ideology for a reason.\n\nHaving gotten that out of the way we have the social left and right, or the concept of more liberal or more authoritarian governments, and small govt vs big govt. No government of India is really all that pro small govt. Electoral bluster aside the BJP has no plans at all to turn India into a libertarian paradise, and authoritarianism of the worst kind is employed when it suits them, in every state they control. Gradually privatizing unprofitable public enterprises, streamlining a bloated bureaucracy and bringing about neoliberal reforms slowly is something the UPA started in the 90s. Nothing unique to the BJP. It\'s always in the context of a very left-leaning populist economic system that is modeled after the Soviet state - which believed in extensive subsidies, token sops and making the govt the owner of sectors where it had no business to be in from the start.\n\nNow coming to the social spectrum - which is where political parties differ the most and alarmingly so. The congress is/was just a standard 1-party state political party much like the Yugoslav party under Tito. It housed a number of very different ideas like communism, neoliberalism, hindutva, anti-west thinking and pro-west thinking.\n\nThe BJP is like a majoritarian nationalist breakaway group like Milosevic\'s Serb nationalists. The Congress kept violent majoritarianism somewhat bottled up, occasionally "giving" in for electoral gains out of Machiavellianism. The BJP is majoritarian by design, and hindu identity pride based supremacism has never had it better.\n\nIt\'s not that the BJP is just right wing, the people with the real power in the Sangh Parivar correspond to the far right - the equivalent of white nationalist or neo-nazi groups like the bajrang dal, shri ram sena and all the gau rakshak outfits have the blessings of the Parivar. And it\'s not that the Sangh is at an immature stage at all, it\'s been spreading it\'s cancerous roots all over Hindu society even before independence.\n\nThe ideology behind the BJP is far worse than Trump\'s GoP or European anti-EU parties like even the UKIP. On social parameters hindutva is a lot closer to Putinism, Milosevic\'s "idea" of Serb Nationalism, Turk nationalism or even Islamism. How many deaths each of these have caused is bound to vary, but there are a lot of shared ideas and similarities.\n\n>conservative Hindu majority felt being alienated by the minority appeasement and vote bank politics of the so-called left parties\n\nThe reality is that there is a very violent and hateful brand of supremacism and identity pride in the hindu upper caste communities in certain parts of India. Especially in the North and Western parts of the country. The congress never really did anything about it. It\'s not the "right", this is the far-right.\n\n>force the right to abandon the extreme elements of its ideology\n\nNope, the extreme elements of hindutva are what defines them. There is nothing even remotely equivalent to the conservative party in the UK, christian democrats in Germany or the GoP in America. Indian society is much more regressive and dysfunctional, and hence so is Indian politics.\n\n>increase in progressive population\n\nThe \'progressive\' population is restricted to the urban middle classes or rather westernized elite, and at times even this class is not progressive. The middle class in India is roughly 4.6% of the population and the progressives would probably be 1%.\n\nThe future is grim, to see India any other way is wishful thinking - this may sound fatalistic, but it\'s much closer to reality than the "India shining" or "India superpower 2030" rhetoric or the naive smug optimists who believe in the power of everything eventually turning out all right.\n\nhttp://www.acting-man.com/?author=104911\n\nThis blog provides some much needed perspective on what the state of Indian politics actually is.\n\nOr this\n\nhttp://www.indiandefensenews.in/2015/10/the-myth-of-liberal-india.html\n\nMost Indian democratic institutions have been systematically eroded (not just by the BJP), and we have a much more populist kind of politics in India that matches Indian society in all it\'s regressiveness much more closely. Be it left or right, most chief ministers are like thuggish feudal lords leading a pack of thieves and thugs. The right is all that plus murderous majoritarianism.\nAnd the center is headed by a saffron oligarchy that acts like an emperor over everyone else.\n\n>The pendulum will swing back and forth\n\nWhen the pendulum goes between corrupt Machiavellian (UPA) who do everything in their power to get votes and exactly the same thing with an added murderous majoritarian streak - it\'s definitely not ok. Pushing India towards a Hindu Pakistan is not healthy.'
'Congress has gone through generations, indeed.\n\n- First generation members were high-caste independence activists who wanted more autonomy and reduction in taxes, as well as a halt to heinous Briton atrocities. And eventually social reformers were attracted and recruited in.\n\n- Second generation was when the rich, westernized members started entering the party as leaders. Interwar era. ALA Lal-Bal-Pal and others.\n\n- Third generation was during an age of conflict and agony for the country and the world. The high point of Gandhi and Nehru They were among those who kicked the Britons out. And for the first decade, ran the country in a great fashion...and then died.\n\n- Fourth generation was basically newcomers and stooges on Indira Gandhi\'s payroll, a woman who was increasingly becoming an autocrat. Nehru-Gandhi dynasty takes over the party. Wealthy landowners and industrialists etc. supported them behind the curtains.\n\n- The fifth one was where most senior and aged politicians of this age were originally from. At this point Indira Gandhi is empress of India in all but name, and this is the height of of the Congress party\'s power. The party temporarily loses but regains popularity.\n\n- The next generation is where their hegemonic power begins to fall. Indira is assassinated, dumb and dumber Netas continue entering the party, corruption rises. Rajiv Gandhi tries to reassert control and fails, and is assassinated.\n\n- Next one is the \'90s and the millennial era, when a great change is taking place across India. Congress depended on N-G dynasty leadership, which is all but gone. They lose spectacularly to the rising powers like BJP nationally, and to very active local parties in states.\n\n- But at the same time, at least as far as news goes, it is Sonia Gandhi and her advisors who held it all together (and prevented themselves from being sidelined), and uses her experience and remaining advisory to rebuild the party. Sonia leads the party back into power and regains the dynastic prestige to an extent.\n\n- Current generation, the "Rahul Gandhi" era. A party that temporarily resurged back heavily, only to fall back on recruiting some of the dumbest people alive as politicians despite having a wealth of talent elsewhere (Shashi Tharoor etc.) or local-level veterans who have waited decades to be promoted.\n\nAnd of course, they continue to shoot the foot in themselves. Sonia left another leadership vacuum, which no one wants to fill either due to their own incompetence, or the overreliance on the N-G dynasty to provide the role. At least the saffron horde is equally dumb and might hand the 2024 election back to some other party.'

'Tbh Tamizh Nadu also has strong labor laws and trade unions as well, but the Government does not get involved in the negotiations unlike Kerala, where the Govt overtly favors the Unions.

'Well, may Lord Ganesh bless you all 😉'
"Elephants and many other animals are far closer to humans when it comes to feelings,  emotions, intelligence etc. It pains me to see how cruelly we treat them, esp in Western countries with so little regard for anything except our own materialism.\n\nJust think of the abject poverty in India, and these villagers still find time and money to do this. \n\nIts amazing and I hope someone reading this who's rich can donate some money to the cause."

"They are smart, majestic creatures. I am a big fan as well. You should check with Sanctuaries or national parks. Elephants also play a large part in Kerala's culture and most temples have their own elephants, many of whom are mistreated. You can check with large devasom boards (temple trusts) to work with these elephants and improve their lives. They are trying to improve the way they handle these animals.\n\nThe largest tame elephant group is part of the Guruvayoor Devasom housed at the [Punnathurkotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnathurkotta)"
"> They are smart, majestic creatures. \n\nAnd they are emotional. They remember things and they love each other and humans. If there is a baby in the herd, every elephant loves it and cares for it. It's only when they are tortured in captivity or their habitat is invaded that they react in violent ways. If you love them, they will love you back."
'I read this yesterday :) it actually prompted me to spend some time with them '
'No. It is more of an natural progressions. Thailand used to use elephants for their logging operations, e.g. carry logs out of jungle. However, this became illegal, and thus you have a bunch of elephants that are pretty tame. Using these elephants for tourism became a natural outcome. '
"You should see r/babyelephantgifs. It's my safe space on internet "

'We do need to find an ideal balance. One way to go about it is to tax the "unused" pile of money that huge corporates keep accumulating. A good example is apple, which is said to have around $100+ billion dollar (if I remember right). Increased taxes on such hoarded money would mean that they would rather spend it to expand their business or create new business and that could be very beneficial to the economy.'

Looks like a utopia.\n\nBtw, which Ambani you're talking about? Dhirubhai Ambani? Yes he was an average man and became rich. The present Ambanis?

So, he may have went on making it more practical than making it aesthetically pleasing.\n"
"The renderings that were put out seemed much nicer than what it turned out to be.

"Why would anyone with money do blue collar work? Most of us Indians who can afford have maids and drivers. Coming to the industrial workforce, most states rely on Bihar and Orissa. If most of us were as rich as the Saudis, we'd probably do exactly the same as they're doing. We are not really different from them as a society. Our biggest advantage is that as a country where English is a common language, we are taking baby steps getting inspired by the socially progressive west. "
"Could be a question of incentives - Saudis receive tons of job security just by being Saudis. Under Saudization, many Arabs got high-level jobs over Indians who had worked far longer and harder. And the Indians would have to work even harder to carry the new weight of clueless managers. There's no drive to work hard or innovate among Saudi men.\n\nAmong Saudi women, however, I'd say it's the opposite - since they're repressed in the KSA, they do even better when they leave, fighting to become doctors and the like.\n\nIran has been facing tremendous odds ever since their terrible war with Iraq. I have to stress that it's a miracle Iran is still a functioning economy today. Very few countries recover from wars like that only to be hit by sanctions - and still come out looking good. Oil is just a piece of the puzzle though I have more to learn about Iran's resilience. I really hope Trump doesn't fuck up the nuke deal. They have an entire generation of aspiration.

If only being rich was the requirement, why don't rich Indians hire maids from even poorer countries like Bangladesh(legal migrants) and Sub-Saharan Africa a la Arabs?\n\nThere's a lot of factors at stake. Socioeconomic conditions like abundance of unskilled labour, unorganized workforce, rudimentary education, overpopulation all factor into your examples of maids and migrant workers. That being said, these are national problems which have been plaguing the system for decades. It's not a cultural problem I believe. "

And as someone from Kerala, you should be more than aware of how much the employment opportunities in the Gulf have benefited the state.\n\nQatar and the other Gulf countries just offer certain jobs for so and so salary and people here make the voluntary choice to accept it because it is multiple times what they can make back home. If people don't want, they don't have to take up the offer. But some people are just too privileged to understand it and want to call it slavery and what-not."

Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job.

"I don't know what kind of Madrassas they are running in North India, but in Kerala it's just religious stuff, like Sunday School ( I guess ).\nWe were taught to read and mug up few chapters in Quran, Arabic , verses like the ones you say during namaz , some Islamic history etc. \nWe used to go there every morning before school (1 or 2 hours ). \n"
"I wasn't aware of these kinds of state controlled madrasa. In Kerala they are parellel. I studied in both school and Madrasa together. Ie madrasa education will be before or after regular school schedule. \n\nSo let government ensure that all the students are enrolling modern school education. Allow students to study in religious institutions before/after regular school time. Since it is their constitutional right "
'> “The Madrassa Board will be dissolved and academic part will be handed over to the Board of Secondary Education,” Sarma wrote in a tweet on Tuesday evening.\n“To mainstream Madrassa education, we are disbanding Madrasa Education Directorate and making it part of Secondary Education Directorate,” he added.\n\n> “We want to introduce modern learning like computers in these educational institutes. For doing this, we have to change the existing structure,” Sarma said during his reply to a Cut Motion on Supplementary Demands for Grants for Mid-Day Meal Scheme.\n\nITT: Literally nobody read the fucking article.'
'This should be done first in UP, Bihar and WB where the bulk of the Muslim population is.\n\nDisbanding the madarsas completely and mainstreaming them is of utmost importance for two factors (I) so that the kids get actual education useful in real world and career and (II) national security. Too much shady radicalization shit going on.'
"this should have been done in Kashmir like in 90's"
'Good move but hope people realise gurukul styled schools and missionary schools are also not modern and should be removed as well.'
'Quickly introduce "Advance Studies for Gau Mutra". Bit rich of BJP Govt to talk about "Modern Learning". \n\nI do support if the Govt wants to clear all Religious bullshit from Education '
'But the article 30 of our constitution grants the minorities, the right to establish and administer their own educational institutions. It will be interesting to see what will happen if someone challenges this in the court. This might even blow into a national issue if the court rules it in the favor of the State.\n'
"As I understood from the news, the Assam Madrasah board, which is a recognised government body, has been scrapped or rather subsumed under the State Education Board. All Madrasahs in Assam aren't government ones. The ones which are governmental are governed by Madrasah board and their curriculum is broadly the same as other state schools, with addition of some religious subjects. So, this just seems like an administrative change but rather good PR to boost Hindu right-wing credentials of Assam government, as large vocal section of this country wants governments to do something about the 'muslims'. Mind you, I don't have a problem if government improves the standard of education in these schools, as state schools need to be better supported everywhere.\n\nMadrasah Education needs to be modernised, not just by adding more secular subjects where they aren't part of curriculum, but also the way Islamic curriculum is structured. It is happening, probably not at a pace everyone wants, but muslims too recognise the need for more rounded education.\n\nI chuckle at many of the comments in this thread when people talk about radicalisation and all other similar motifs which undoubtedly come to the fore when the word 'muslim' appears in an article. I went to secular schools all along and some of better universities in this country, and I see the level of radicalisation in comments of some of the people I studied with."
'There are two types of Madrassas. One is like a regular school with Islamic education as an extra subject and Arabic as the third language. The other type is where students are only taught Quran and nothing else. The latter is what most people talk about, the former is where most students go to. '
"Don't forget UP. Largest state w/ huge number of madarsas."
'>Dont want to sound like a dick but these places are melting pots of radicalisation.\n\nSource? or you just feel like this way'
"Any and all Schools must be accredited by ICSE/CBSE/StateBoard or equivalent. I'm sure there's a list of approved boards already. If a school is following one of the Accreditation Boards, having extra subjects as part of their curriculum should be okay. \n\nCurriculum for every class/standard/grade must be publicly available.\n\nAny institution that doesn't have the accreditation, can't have children go there full time, as this will be against the RTE (in spirit).\n\nPart time/Evenings/etc is fine. They'll be in the same categories as all those Art Classes/Summer Camps/etc/.\n"
"That means a vast majority of India's best schools & colleges will have to be shut down.\n"
">all states need this \n\nYes, that's true. I think he singled us out because the rest of the country believes that we will be Islamic caliphate within a few years. Baler shob kotha barta. TBH India needs less religious influence in *all* spheres, not just education."
'Then why most of them turn up religious nuts... There are very few good professions where i see muslims.. '
'States with significant Muslim population have their own government recognised Madrassa boards which regulate Madrassas'
"Great point. I'm never asking for them to be shut down. The state Government can work with the existing school management trust to make sure that the operations are transferred to a jointly created non-religious body which can maintain a period of supervision (say, 10 years) into withdrawal of religious institutions from aforementioned trusts and then further continue as the de facto management. "
"Concern over sectarian/communal nature of RTE is more than concerns over fundamental structure of RTE. But that doesn't mean I don't have problems with the fundamental structure with RTE."
'Yes . Classes were in Malayalam but we had to mug those Arabic verses and stuff .'
'Kashmir is a prosperous state with a high standard of living so very few children study in Madrassas unlike rural hovels like Assam, Bengal, Bihar and Eastern UP. The average Kashmiri has the same standard of living as the average Punjabi.'
"Yep, Madrassa literally means school in Arabic.\n\nIn cities, rich kids go to the latter ones for 3-4 **years** to memorize Quran and poor kids go because they can't afford school, that's pretty much it.\n\nSource: Have friends who have been to latter.  One is CA, one is doctor and one failed college so his dad set up a factory for him. None of them terrorists.\n\n\n**Edits: in bold**"
'>What about those aspects of science which are considered blasphemous in Islam? Are these covered in the Madrassas as well? \n\nExample?'
"That's because unlike how they are characterized in popular media, most Muslims do not wear the white scullcap all the time or have any beards. Unless you ask their name, it's very hard to tell a Muslim from a Hindu."
'There are literally higher than average Muslims in professions like CAs and Lawyers, but only in cities like Mumbai. There is decades of difference between a born and bred Mumbaikar Muslim from Charni Road and a Muslim from rural Ghazipur in Eastern UP\n'
">Then why most of them turn up religious nuts... There are very few good professions where i see muslims..  \n\nAbsolutely, I don't see anyone,\u200b with skullcap, lungi and a holding a big knife, in good professions. They all look like butchers\u200b, no?"
"I don't think you have to go after religious natures of school. What you need to do is make sure courses taught in school comply with state government courses or CBSE. "
'You cannot compare missionary run schools and madrasa. Lot of the convent schools are run by missionaries and are possibly the best schools in cities. '
"Sarawati shishu mandir, which has 17000 school network is fully governed by RSS. Dayanand anglo vedic or DAV is one of the popular school branches. \nSure they don't teach religion there, just way of life is taught there."
"That's not something to be proud of lol"
"Don't have many because the Quoran actually implores it's followers to seek the truth by observing nature. But the theory of evolution is in stark contrast with what's written in the book. So I wonder how these Madrassas deal with it"
"It's actually good for Muslims (though not fundamentalists) that fewer kids will get a useless education. The more mainstream education they get, the better of the community will be.\n\nAnd nothing is stopping the kids from getting religious education on the side."
"I partly agree. Almost everyone in my mother's generation in my family went to a Catholic school because they were some of the best schools back then.\n\nHowever the same rules should exist for all religious institutions, just cause some great schools exist doesn't mean there aren't hard-line schools that are mainly for religious learning which shouldn't be allowed to operate"
"So? Different rules for different people? Same thing can be applied to one or two Good Muslim institute. Then I also need to open a Hindu institute \u200bto train future gau rakshaks just like minorities do? Shouldn't I be allowed to do that? \n\nMany Hindu Institutions closed because of RTE, they could also argue the same. If we want to improve our society; religion doesn't have any place in education and so is religious institutions in that future."

Demeaning the life work of so many scientists who had done thorough research and experiments to make it successful.\n\nJugaad rockets don't end up in space.\nAs for this specific video, sorting like this is exactly how it's done almost everywhere.

'**Kushan Empire**\n\nThe Kushan Empire (Ancient Greek: Βασιλεία Κοσσανῶν; Bactrian: Κυϸανο, Kushano; Sanskrit: कुषाण राजवंश Kuṣāṇ Rājavaṃśa; BHS: Kashana Guṣāṇa-vaṃśa; Chinese: 贵霜帝国; Parthian: Kušan Kashana -xšaθr) was a syncretic empire, formed by Yuezhi, in the Bactrian territories in the early 1st century. It spread to encompass much of Afghanistan, present-day Pakistan, and then the northern parts of India at least as far as Saketa and Sarnath near Varanasi (Benares), where inscriptions have been found dating to the era of the Kushan emperor Kanishka the Great. Emperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward toward the Indian subcontinent the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority.\n\nThe Kushans were one of five branches of the Yuezhi confederation, a possibly Iranic or Tocharian, Indo-European nomadic people who migrated from Gansu and settled in ancient Bactria.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'

'I doubt India and Israel will ever be at odds.\n\nIts like theyre genuinely natural allies'

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**We’ve waited 70 yrs for you, Israeli PM tells Modi as he lands in Tel Aviv** \n\n ______ \nTEL AVIV: "We have waited for 70 years for you," Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu greeted PM Narendra Modi soon after his aircraft touched down to an effusive welcome that saw Modi reciprocating the warmth, saying his visit marked a "path breaking journey of engagement".As Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Israel, a late afternoon sun beat down on the red carpet at a secluded corner of Ben Gurion airport. As Air India One taxied up, Netanyahu was waiting at the bottom of the steps and Modi, dressed in a cream bandhgala, lightly ran down and both men enveloped each other in a bear hug."Aapka swagat hai mere dost," Netanyahu said as the leaders hit the right notes. Modi returned a "shalom" and said in Hebrew that he was delighted to be in Israel.Netanyahu said, "We love India. We admire your culture, history, democracy and commitment to progress. I am confident of the real mathematics of life, of success of our partnership for many reasons, talent of our people."Modi touched upon a personal memory of Netanyahu\'s — Tuesday was the 41st anniversary of the Entebbe raid to save 94 Israeli hostages held in Uganda — an operation that claimed the life of the Israeli leader\'s elder brother. "Your heroes are an inspiration for the younger generations," Modi said.The PM was greeted by leaders of all major religions here — Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jew, Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Catholic and Muslim — a ritual that is only reserved for the Pope or the US president. Netanyahu led Modi through introductions with his cabinet and senior officials.When Modi introduced his delegation beginning with NSA Ajit Doval, Netanyahu said he was glad the visit had come to fruition. "You had something to do with it," he told Doval.In his welcome remarks, Netanyahu reminded Modi that he had said "the sky is the limit for India and Israel". "We are working together in space programmes, so we can now say the sky is not the limit anymore," he said. Acknowledging Modi\'s love for acronyms, Bibi delivered one of his own, "I-square-plus-T-square — India and Israel plus Israeli technology and Indian talent, is India-Israel ties for tomorrow."Modi\'s tried his hand at Hebrew with a "Shalom le kulaam ani semya mayodh lehiyot po (I am delighted to be here)." The PM\'s appreciation of Israel clearly came through. "The people of Israel have built a nation on democratic principles. They have nurtured it with hard work, grit and the spirit of innovation. You have marched on regardless of adversity and converted challenges into opportunity. India applauds your achievements," he said."In our path of sustained high growth and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners. The need to rely on science, technology, innovation, and higher technical education to overcome our developmental challenges is common to both of us," Modi added.Both leaders clearly bonded at a personal level, which came through at the airport ceremony. Over the next couple of days, the two men will spend virtually all their waking moments together.Later, Modi visited a flower farm, where he was given a chrysanthemum named after him. The business end of the visit had begun with a briefing on cutting edge agricultural technologies. A little later, Modi paid a symbolically significant visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, which has a hall with the name of 4.6 million victims of Nazi terror.Michael Oren, former Israeli envoy to the US and a senior minister in Netanyahu\'s office, told TOI, "India and Israel share democratic values and our partnership is important for development. Also, as the US begins to turn away, its important for us to look out for each other."In his interaction, Netanyahu welcomed back foreign secretary S Jaishankar. In the past few months, Doval and Jaishankar have made trips here to stitch up details of the visit and the agreements.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'politics aside, but we need to friend with everyone who is willing to befriend. whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business. '
'Then plays The Imperial March.'
"With the BJP, yes, they have a natural anti-Muslim connection. Plus India will buy a ton of drones and other surveillance equipment. \n\nAt the same time, India has had long standing ties with Palestine, and a traditional tie with Arab and Iranian oil. For the most part, the latter won out, until now.\n\nEdit: For those downvoting, I'd be curious to know why you disagree with this."
'They were waiting for Indian PM, not Modi.\n\nSome people... SMH'
'For the greater good.'
">Okay, Palestine is one issue over which we are not towards Israel's side for right reasons. Doesn't mean we should not be friendly towards Israel.\n\nWell, this has always been the Indian perspective.\n\n>The citizens are the one who pays taxes and elects the governments, and it is their right that they get the foremost priority by the Indian government\n\nAnd if the citizens want to make a fuss about Israel because of Palestinian issue, then why is that not a priority?\n\nI agree with you mostly, but hopefully you understand why it means we also shouldn't just pretend things are good over there when they are not, just as we don't pretend things are good over here when they are not."
'This is why Modi and Israeli PM love each other, only two people with enough shady history of atrocities to be able to say "What you do with your minorities, none of our business."'
'>whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business.\n\nWrong. I would like my country to stand for principled justice.'
'Yes you can. Israel issues a visa on a separate piece of paper. This means no stamps on your passport.\n\nBest way to do it is to fly directly to Israel or go to Jordan and then through to Israel.\n\nJordan is awesome too - north Jordan feels like a Mediterranean country while the South feels like a Middle Eastern Country.'
'The muslim minority in Israel (not PA) is way better off than all neighbours around there. At least I saw women work and drive around in cars.'
'>Double Standards much?\n\nWhat double standards? What is the official policy of India for Balochastan? How many Balochis have we given asylum to and how many Baloch freedom resolutions have we supported?\n'
"First of all we don't have any official policy on Baluchistan. Yeah our beloved PM mess it up by mentioning it in speech. \rAnd same way we don't like some random nation talking about kashmir"
"So buying oil from Middle East and Iran is affirmation that India agrees to their funding of Terrorism and creating instability in various regions. \n\nWe sell onions to Pakistan and have MFN status so we endorse the terrorism.\n\nWe are super close with Russians so we agree to their annexation of Crimea.\n\nHaving Deals with country doesn't mean that one supports the country's policies. "
'So which nation should we befriend? \n\nIf we befriend Russia, we endorse Putin\'s expansionism in Ukraine and his suppression of democracy at home.\n\nIf we befriend US, we endorse their war on Iraq \n\nIf we befriend China, we endorse their suppression of democracy and their aggression in 1962.\n\nIf we befriend Australia, we endorse the Lost Generations policy.\n\nIf we befriend the gulf countries, we endorse their use of slave labor, their theocracy and support for terrorists.\n\nIf we befriend the UK we endorse their colonialism.\n\nIf we befriend the Germans... No, let\'s not even go there.\n\nSo basically we befriend only those people that have never sinned. That should be easy.\n\nOf course there is no such thing as a friend in diplomacy anyway. There are only interests. We should be as cynical about pursuing our interests as every other nation is. If that means we use the word "friend" insincerely to describe a country we want close relations with, so be it.'
'yes there is a separate platform for that UN, \n\nsimilarly are we comfortable any random nation condemn us on Kashmir issue?'
"Yea if only Hamas and some other shitbags didn't keep violating ceasefires and using schools and hospitals to hide weapons.\n\nIF ONLY"
'there are too many issues within the country which needs principled justice before looking outside. '
"Standing selflessly for principle where everybody else is cynically looking out for their interests is folly. Plus, if we only deal with countries who have never sinned, we'll need to stop having deals with the Arabs, the Russians, the Americans, the Europeans and the Asians as well.\n\nIn fact we've sinned a lot ourselves too, so holding ourselves as some kind of superior moral authority is basically throwing stones while living in a glass house."
'Sounds like a win-win to me.'
"Why are they supposed to be peaceful after being violently driven off of their own land?\n\nAlso, peaceful or not peaceful doesn't excuse human rights violations. If a person commits a crime, put them through the justice system, don't punish the entire minority of your country because of criminals."

Till then your guess is as good as mine."
"Indians don't get this but the problem with the US isn't just racism, though there is bad racism, but guns. There are more guns than people in America. If people don't want to move to the US the gun issue should be at least as large a factor as racism or America's omnipresent decline. "

">America has its own rednecks\n\nThe vast majority of them are uneducated blue collar class workers. Rich educated americans from big cities overwhelmingly tend to be socially progressive. This is true in most of western europe as well, and in fact most of the developed world.\n\n>Berkeley riots and Antifa beg to differ.\n\nProtests against a scumbag like Milo ? I don't really advocate violence against people like that, but a pedo apologist like him deserves the hate he gets.\n\nBLM, Antifa and Berkeley are all extremely fringe. As is campus social activism to the broader political landscape.\n\n>So the US is an utopia with amazing healthcare, full employment, good education levels, absolutely no racism, no poverty, & finally love and friendship for all, including the homeless people. Obviously no city puts spikes on road sides to ensure the homeless cannot sleep there.\n\nFor most people USA is infinitely better than India, there's not even a comparison. Most Indians posting on reddit live in an extremely insulated bubble of wealth relative to the rest of the country so they aren't really representative in any way.\n\nI'll post what I want on /r/india how frequently as I like, thank you very much.\n\n>Stop putting putting them on a pedestal.\n\nThey don't need to be put on a pedestal, they are already economically and socially light years ahead of India. There's a reason India isn't considered a developed country.\n\n>Someone's butthurt.\n\nThe only person that's butthurt here is you. Whenever India, Hinduism, the Sangh, BJP or Modi get criticized people like you show up. You sadly don't realize how much of an embarrassment this defensiveness is, and how cringey it looks to everyone."
"That's right, bigly is a word, it's the best word in the entire English dictionary, it's the best word, no doubt about that. Whatever Hillary's saying, it's all lies, this here is the best word there is.\n"
">Rich educated americans from big cities overwhelmingly tend to be socially progressive. This is true in most of western europe as well, and in fact most of the developed world.\n\nNo they don't. The majority of college educated white men/women voted for Trump. Big cities largely vote progressive because a lot of minorities live there.\n\n>BLM, Antifa and Berkeley are all extremely fringe. As is campus social activism to the broader political landscape.\n\nThat doesn't mean the vast majority of Americans are self-reflective or against criticism. The reason most Indians (at least on Reddit) get defensive is because people say racist shit about us, not because we don't criticize the country. I do the latter quite a bit on this sub. \n\n>Most Indians posting on reddit live in an extremely insulated bubble of wealth relative to the rest of the country so they aren't really representative in any way.\n\nWe're not ignoring India's problems. But if you don't respect your roots, people will trod all over you. \n\n>they are already economically and socially light years ahead of India.\n\nSee: colonial hangover. Just because they are now doesn't mean we won't in the future. Society doesn't change overnight, even in the glorious West.\n\n"
'Interesting question to ask yourself. Are you *in* a traffic jam, or are *you* the traffic jam?'
'Not to be an asshole, but Mumbai traffic says hi. We have traffic that starts around 10kms away on 12 lane roads! Talk about congestion. If Bengaluru traffic was created by Satan, ours is created by Dormammu himself and there is no bargaining!'
'The city was not built for so many people.\n\nNow before you guys jump, I am not telling outsiders are not allowed or shit. Hear me out.\n\nBangalore was known as pensioners paradise. Basically you could survive on a pension amount. You had a small city which had "welcome to Bangalore" board at yeshvantpur junction. The first thing you could smell entering Bangalore was the amazing biscuit smell of Mangarams factory. The weather hardly crossed 28 degrees. You had beautiful small roads littered with trees. You had decent smart people who were smart (duh) and intelligent. So somewhere in late 90s we had IT companies started setting their companies here.\n\nNow the boom hit so hard that it was unexpected. The city infrastructure was already settled and all of a sudden we had 4 times the population in 20 or odd so years. Now how will the BBMP find place to expand roads and build flyover nd stuff.\n\nNow, think from the government perspective. I am your local MLA who has the budget to build, improve the infrastructure *you* deserve. But do you deserve it. You - who are an outsider, who cannot vote in my constitution deserve good infrastructure?  What\'s in it for me? Plus the companies aren\'t giving me anything. I do not have enough vote bank to do all these, so I serve my 5 years make money (or not) and bugger off.\n\nSo only thing which we can do to avoid these jams \n*  Carpool (which we won\'t do)\n*  use public transport (which we don\'t want to or not enough buses)\n* Lane discipline (ok ok. I heard what I just said)\n*  Have like sharing concepts (I don\'t know why Ola Uber are not thinking of this. Right?)\n\nSo buck up my friend. You will be spending 20 hours per week in traffic. Learn a hobby. Take up knitting or cooking whilst sitting in the traffic. \n\nOr or (I know you are tired of hearing this if you are an outsider)\nIshta illandre thika muchkond hogu/s'
"I've realised that sometimes I spend 14 days at a stretch venturing out only 2km away from home. That too the 2km is to buy groceries once a week from the nearest mega market. If I ordered groceries instead, I'd spend a fortnight within a 500 metre radius. All because it's too much of a pain to go outside.\n\nI'm so lucky that my place of work and my home shares a common boundary wall. Bed to desk in 10 minutes!"
'Every evening I drop down at HSR, walk one and a half kilometer. I walk pretty fast and cross silk board in some twelve to fifteen minutes. \n\n\n\nI save a good thirty to forty minutes with this. Fuck you Bangalore Traffic!'
'Well I cover about 11 kms in 45 mins daily in Bangalore :D'
'I will just sit here and pray for Namma Metro to start across Bangalore. But by then Bangalore would have grown so much that Metro would just suffice and there would be more traffic to cope with.'
"People remember to demand a better public transport and to use it, when its available. It not only reduces congestion, which will save time, if most people use it but is also good for environment, your pocket and your health, as you don't get that stress of atrocious traffic. Government has and can create 4-lane roads and flyovers at every junction, however due to our population and increasing economic prosperity, cars and other vehicles will increase at ten fold rate of infrastructure growth.\n\n\nLeast we can do is use car pooling, as we observe in signal or traffic-jams that most cars, even in an SUV, there are only 1-2 person. \n\n\nHowever, I know most of us won't do this  because tragedy of commons applies in this situation and we will all expect other to change their behaviour, as we have genuine reasons to use a personal car.\n\nThis post is not specifically directed to op or anyone, so please don't take it personally and reply citing anecdotal evidences.\n\nEdit: [Relevant Gif](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/18/ff/2a/18ff2a81570d24aea900a9588222bece.gif)"

"After living in Bangalore for 3 years and changing upto 5 locations it can be safely concluded that the only possible solution to the traffic is to avoid it, which is to walk.\n\nJust get a accommodation near the workplace/college because no matter where you are, at 8-10 in the morning and 7-10 in the night the traffic is a bitch everywhere in Bangalore.\n\nSo, even if you have to pay higher rent it's alright but living near office is totally worth it in a city like Bangalore. You might pay a bit more but you'd live longer with the peace of mind that you get back."

'The grass is always greener. Many posts are making it seem this is only India but the US has horrible public transportation and traffic in most big cities. Try driving in LA during rush hour, its just like India, maybe worse in some ways. Yeah, there\'s not as many distractions on the road and ppl drive better but in some ways its more like a prison than India. Driving in India is actually entertaining even in traffic because you see all sorts of stuff going on inside. The US is like solitary confinement when you are stuck in traffic. \n\nThe fact is that whether its Bangalore or LA or Saigon or Beijing the only way to really "fix" traffic in popular growing large cities is threw massive public transportation. You cannot build enough roads or highways to accommodate all the cars. It\'s just not possible. Getting rid or restricting commutes in private cars is the only solution. '

"Mumbaikar who drives. You are correct, but the Mumbai road network is so well connected that there are three or four ways to get anywhere. I find that going with the Google Map recommendation is effective. Doesn't mean you won't encounter traffic though. "
"IMHO, of all the metros, Bombay is by far the best. The traffic MOVES. The traffic is disciplined and orderly and drivers stick to their lanes. This has been my experience. Of course, there is efficient although crowded public transport that doesn't disappoint. For a city of 20 million, this is super impressive.\n\nBangalore is the worst. Even its army of techies cannot come up with an algorithm to solve it! If any other city tops off the hellhole that is Bangalore traffic -- respect! "
"I've been in Mumbai for the past several years, and I'm originally from Bangalore. Mumbai traffic is bad, but Bangalore is on another level.  \n\nThe amount of traffic you see on western express Highway during peak hours now during metro construction? That would be a good day at silk board.   \n\nMumbai has it relatively good for two reasons: \n\nOur local trains transport a major fuck load of people across the city, who would have otherwise clogged the roads. I know that the local isn't always accessible and the best way to travel, but the point is that it is actively transporting lakhs who'd otherwise resort to the roads. The metro will make this even better in the coming years.  \n\nSecondly, believe it or not, Mumbai as a city is a little more organised than Bangalore. By and large, offices and residential areas are sort of separated and majority of the traffic on bigger roads generally only flows one way most of the times. Bangalore is a lot disorganised.. you have commercial areas and offices in pockets in between seemingly residential areas. "
'I can understand your reasoning but there appears to be a lack of logic to it. \n\nI doubt all these companies kidnapped the MLAs sons and daughters and forced them to set up tech parks and bring outsiders. \n\nI mean, why can nobody question the existing government for not planning the city when they are the same ones who sold this city bit by bit to the companies? \n\nThese companies enjoy so much privileges in these SEZs at the blessing of these politicians. \n\nI am sure if they were concerned enough about outsider ruining their city or culture or infrastructure, they would have put up safeguards. \n\nIf you are Bengaluru native, I understand your pain in seeing the city this way. But bear in mind, people did not appear in this city one fine day and over crowd it. \n\nFor example, the cabinet minister of previous years (dunno his name) knew years ahead, Whitfield was going to explode with new companies. \n\nWhat did he do? Immediately bought all the parcels of land here, hook by crook, for his personal gain. '
"That's awesome! I'm glad some people have this sort of setup. "
"I'm curious, what do you do for a living? "
"This. Glad to see someone is mentioning the importance of public transport and not just traffic management.\n\nRide shares will not take off in the scale we wish for due to security concerns and the govt's undecided stance.\n\nDedicated rapid bus lanes will not take off because there simply isn't enough space save for a few roads.\n\nThe only way is up or down (metro/subway). Subway is not a possibility everywhere because soil in Bangalore is unsuitable for tunnels.\n\n1. Metro: God, please open the Green Line already. \n2. Roundabouts: What we call circle. I've seen properly designed roundabouts handle traffic better than signals. Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad area is a good example.\n\n"

Only because parents have allowed the son to live in their house does not mean they have to bear his "burden" throughout life, the court added.\n\n\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE 1](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-55686648,width-400,resizemode-4/55686648.jpg) | [IMAGE 2](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/51918018.cms) | [IMAGE 3](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/55607104.cms)\n\n___\n\nNEW DELHI: A son, irrespective of hismarital status, has nolegal rightto live in the self-acquired house of his parents and can reside there only at their "mercy", theDelhi high courthas said.\n\n\n\nThe court also said that only because parents have allowed the son to live in their house as long as their relations are cordial does not mean they have to bear his "burden" throughout his life.\n\n\n\n"Where the house is self-acquired by the parents, son whether married or unmarried, has no legal right to live in that house and he can live in that house only at the mercy of his parents up to the time the parents allow," Justice Pratibha Rani said in an order.\n\n"Merely because the parents have allowed him to live in the house so long as his relations with the parents were cordial does not mean that the parents have to bear his burden throughout his life," the court said.\n\n\n\nFather can give property to married daughter, Supreme Court saysIn a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court has ruled that a man is legally entitled to nominate his married daughter to own his cooperative society flat after his death, depriving his wife and only son. The West Bengal Cooperative Societies Rules, 1987, stipulate that the owner of a flat in a cooperative society can nominate his house in favour of a person "belonging to his family".\n\n\n\nIt said this while dismissing an appeal by a man and his wife challenging the order of a trial court which had passed a decree in favour of his parents, who had filed a suit seeking a direction to their son and daughter-in-law to vacate the floors in their possession.\n\n\n\nThe parents, both senior citizens, had told the lower court that both their sons and daughters-in-law, who were living with them, have made their "life hell" after which they had given complaints to the police and also issued public notices in 2007 and 2012 debarring them from their self-acquired property.\n\n\n\nBoth the sons and daughters-in-law had contested the suit before the trial court while denying the allegations. They had also claimed that they were the co-owners of the property as they had contributed towards its purchase and construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Patriarchal system, gender bias should stop’\n\n\n\nHowever, the trial court had passed the decree in favour of the parents after which one of the sons, along with his wife, had moved the high court.\n\n\n\nIn the order, Justice Rani noted that the son and his wife were unable to prove that they were the co-owners of the property, while his parents have established their contention on the basis of documentary evidence.\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article\'s ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Rendered ^by ^PROMETHEUS'

'The judge sounds a lot like my dad.'
'It depends on whether or not the property is under HUF (Hindu Undivided Family i.e if the person is Hindu or not). Usually, it makes sense to put all inherited property in a HUF and members of the HUF has equal share in the assets of the HUF.'

He is now street smart, fit, financially aware and grateful for everything you feed him. Thank me later.

'Always respect individuality.'
"lmao you're tripping.This judgement just says that men aren't entitled to stay in a house that their parents buy after they become an adult. Most men will still receive the bulk of their parents wealth.\n\nAlso men and women aren't treated alike under the law because we live in a heavily patriarchal society. "

'His thoughts about the award ceremony in his [biography] (https://books.google.com/books?id=RbgXRdnHkiAC&hl=en)\n> When the Nobel award was announced I saw it as a personal triumph, an achievement for me and my collaborators -- a recognition for a very remarkable discovery, for reaching the goal I had pursued for 7 years. But when I sat in that crowded hall and I saw the sea of western faces surrounding me, and I, the only Indian, in my turban and closed coat, it dawned on me that I was really representing my people and my country. I felt truly humble when I received the Prize from King Gustav; it was a moment of great emotion but I could restrain myself. Then I turned round and saw the British Union Jack under which I had been sitting and it was then that I realised that my poor country, India, did not even have a flag of her own - and it was this that triggered off my complete breakdown.

"Small story: The Raman effect wasn't actually discovered by Raman but by one his research underlings (But I'm guessing thats how most research discoveries work). Apparently there were two people working on the research and them two were brothers. The brothers each claim to have discovered it with each claiming the other didn't and rumor has it that created it a rift between them and their families. \n\nHow do I know this - One of the brothers was my grandmom's uncle.

'That is not ironic, considering Lenin inherited a collapsed imperial power in ruin, with no end to troubles in sight...eventually resorting to wars.

"I used to think like that earlier, but I hold no more spite with Modi since he relaxed the gst norms for small service providers like me a few days ago. Agreed that we shouldn't have been dragged into gst to begin with, but as they say *better late than never!*"

"Here's the thing - the public does that with their own income, not with tax payer money outside their salary or income. They are doing charity. This guy is just robbing and irresponsible."

'>Demonetization\n\nFair enough. Demonetization was a mishandled\n\n>Badly implemented GST\n\nIf you expected the largest tax reform since independence to be perfect from the beginning I can\'t say much to you. GST was long overdue and it is far from "screwing the country". It has been three months since the GST was implemented. I\'m sure the issues will be sorted out in the mean time.'
"Did you expect the govt. and GST council to nail the largest tax reform in the first attempt? There are issues and were always going to be a few issues and I'd much rather Modi listen to the feedback and make improvements along the way.\n\n"
"I agree with your point, people do it with their own money.\n\nIn Modi's case, he didn't get it made. His chamchas made it for him. They know how to appeal to Modi, so they got his name printed on the suit. Don't blame Modi for that, he didn't ask for it. He didn't ask for a suit with his own name on it. \n\nHe didn't put it up for auction WHEN the media reported it, it was always meant to be like that iirc.\n\nAre you really claiming that he donated the money to charity to portray a better image of himself? That may very well be true, but you can't claim that because you have no knowledge of it."
'Sure thing lungiboi, you want to take notes before I dictate?'
'>It has been three months since the GST was implemented. I\'m sure the issues will be sorted out in the mean time.\n\nHaven\'t we heard this before? "Mujhe 50 din dijiye bhaiyo aur beheno". Please stop with the bland rhetoric. You don\'t get a free pass to screw over and disrupt people lives and livelihoods over and over again. Any other country and people would demand resignations from the prime minister. \n\nIf you are unsure about how the systems and the process would react you don\'t roll it out at full scale. You do pilot\'s and roll it out in phases. These are basics that you shouldn\'t have to teach an "able administrator".'
"I agree with you. But this sub for the past few weeks is full of paid posters who are running some social media campaign against Modi. Just check my comment history, and the history of people who I replied to. Very focused one one topic in one sub. That's not the normal Redditor history.."
"> hey know how to appeal to Modi, so they got his name printed on the suit. Don't blame Modi for that, he didn't ask for it. He didn't ask for a suit with his own name on it.\n> \n> He didn't put it up for auction WHEN the media reported it, it was always meant to be like that iirc.\n\nMost powerful man in India could not say no to his chamchas?\n\nThis is classic apologist speak."

He didn't ask for a suit with his own name on it. \n\nAnd surely the chamchas made him wear it too. Don’t blame Modi for that, he didn’t wear it. He didn’t wear a suit with his own name. It was the chamchas making him wear it without his knowledge!"

"It's clear by your comment that you've never been respected by anyone enough to gift you something nice. Well, I have, and it's immensely rude to refuse a gift no matter how gaudy it may seem.\n\nModi turned an expensive gift from chamchas into a donation for charity, and you're complaining about that? \n\nFocus on his actual flaws, which he has plenty of. Don't waste your time on this irrelevant shit."
"Ohh, you have a reading problem I see. I never said that millions of people do charity for public image.\n\nTch tch, you have a reading problem lungiboi.\n\n> claim them to be doing charity just for the sake of public image\n\nBy using this sentence, I was using sarcasm to point out to the  esteemed gentleman i replied to the preposterousness of his statement\n\n> money given to charity - Its called creating heroic image.\n\nThe thing is, my dear lungiboi, that I do not agree with that statement. When he applied it to Mudiji, I called him out by saying that you could claim that millions of people around the country were doing charity for public image.\n\nObviously, that's not objectively true.\n\nSo, now that we've completed **sarcasm 101: Teaching condescension to idiots on the internet**, let's move on to a burning question.\n\nHow is it that you're a proud lungiboi, and still have such terrible grasp over the English language?

'Please. You can’t get a suit worth lakhs made without some amount of custom fitting. Modi was definitely measured and he was the one who actually bought it, not his chamchas. '
"2 comments ago someone was claiming that you should do charity with your own money.\n\nSo, if I'm to understand your dichotomy, Modi is narcissistic whether he bought the suit himself, or he was gifted the suit. Furthermore, since he donated it to charity, it doesn't matter if he bought it with his own money, or it was gifted to him?\n\nThis just perfectly displays your bias. You're like no matter what Modi is in the wrong here. There's no point arguing with you geniuses. You refuse to have a sensible discussion.\n\nThis sub is more r/ihatemodi than it is r/india\n\nWow, mental gymnastics are amazing, guys.\n\n"
"Kya hai bc nobody pasted the relevant parts, ok fine I will only do it.  \nPart 1\n\n> When Varun came on stage to receive his award, Saif said, “You are here because of your papa.” To which Varun replied, “And, you’re here because of your mummy.” Karan added, “I am here because of my papa”, before the trio in unison declared “Nepotism rocks'.    \n\nPart 2\n\n>The joke wasn’t over. After all, Kangana was yet to be mentioned.\nSo, Varun said to Karan, “There was a song in your film: 'Bole Choodiyan, Bole Kangana'”. To which the director-producer replied, “Kangana nahi hi bole toh achcha hai. Kangana bahut bolti hai (It’s better Kangana doesn’t say anything; she talks a lot).”\n\n"

'So, they have resorted to sarcasm instead of accepting the reality like a mature person. Way to go, dickheads.'
"Nothing to do with Kangna who while the one who took the initiative to take the bull by the horns isn't the only one to be negatively affected by the fact of rampant nepotism in Bollywood as well as the lack of variety and range in the films that are released. \n\nIf it weren't for movies made by people outside bollywood nobody would have discovered Sunny Pawar in Bollywood. Neither would Dev Patel or Frieda Pinto ever find themselves on any Red Carpet anywhere in Bollywood.\n\nIf Bollywood wasn't so inbred every other movie would have casting calls that would exhaustively select from thousands to give a newcomer a shot at acting. And we as audiences would have a much richer experience in theaters."

'Arrogant dimwits, these star-kids are. They say some utterly, boring things like, "You need talent to be successful, irrespective of how you come to cinema". People with no background from cinema gets just one opportunity; to them, a failure means a career ender. But that\'s not the same with star kids. Leave failure, most don\'t even get an opporutiny to showcase. First of, you need to be in a sports competition, either to win it or lose it. Star kids are always in the competition, and the talent ones win it. But many without the background won\'t even get to be in the competition. That\'s the problem. '
'"Nepotism rocks" for getting an award. but that is the only thing keeping Bollywood movies in substandard level.  '
'Bollywood sucks anyway, regional cinema in India is better by miles. Do yourself a favour and watch good Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali and other language films. '
'Karan Johar is just silly, slap stick and over dressed on stage. He is better off behind scenes as a producer. Intellectually the show was very painful to watch, no one, except Alia (surprising) looked like they had evolved.'
'Indeed KJo is an "unsuitable boy".  I wish Kangana writes that book on nepotism making KJo the flag bearer. '
"I think nepotism works because of the masses. People are mad about film stars and so are they about their kids even before they star in a movie. If people simply start recognizing the talent of other actors who are non khandani, they can make it big over night. These kids are not born stars. They are far from it. The crowds make them to be, by getting baited with amazing PR and marketing tactics their daddy's put to work. But its not like every star kid makes it big either. Look at Fardeen and Zayed Khan for example. What would be ideal is, put these star kids into the shoes of a character actor and see, where they stand. \n"
"I'm definitely against nepotism in the film industry or anywhere for that matter, but the issue is debatable. \n\nAlia is by no means a substandard actor. She might be dumb and all, but she's matured over the years and delivered some powerful women centric performances. Ranbir is another example of a brilliant actor, whose family has for generations ruled the film industry. \n\nBollywood also gave us Aamir Khan, pretentious, yet one of the finest actors in India today. \n\nAnd yet there are other actors from the Kapoor family (Randhir, Rajiv), or the other Kapoor family (Sanjay, Arjun, Sonam), Salman's brothers, Aamir's brother, nephew, Bachchan Jr., etc. who haven't been very successful. \n\nComing from a family of actors may get you your first break, it usually doesn't guarantee that you will stay for long. You have a ready platform if you are David Dhawan's son, agreed. But longevity is achieved only with talent. \n\nPS: Salman ka talent ye hai ki wo dikhta accha hai. "

"An honest question to all of you who are pissed at Bollywood nepotism, haven't you came across many other professions in India where it's prominent?

'Nepotism: the practice among those with power or influence of favouring relatives or friends, especially by giving them jobs.\n\nBy the meaning of the word, doctor families and advocate families are not nepotism.

"It IS different. Art is not an inherited trait. Business skills, knowledge, tricks etc CAN be passed over generations. It is not for nothing that banias are good at business.

'Thats not nepotism. Nepotism will be Supreme Court filled with family members where your power is used to put your own people in those posts.'
"I suppose children of doctors, lawyers etc still have to study and pass exams to become doctors and lawyers themselves. Of course things are a bit easier if your parents are also in that profession and some would still call it nepotism . Also its pretty normal for business families to pass on ownership to their kids who in any case will still go through business schools etc to have a chance of inheriting their family business. \n\nIts not often in the news often but the other side of the coin is that even bollywood kids don't always make it, off the top of my head im thinking Mithun's son. "

However, when some chutiya lawyer looking for fame stumbles upon it, I'm sure he is going to face a problem. \n\nI personally hope that day never comes though. Judiciary in India is a joke when it comes to things like this. The government is no longer a body that runs the country based on priorities, they are running a dictatorship appeasing to ill informed masses and some of them happen to be lawyers that are killing our constitutional right to freedom of speech."

So **the more poor and disadvantaged the students story gets, the more public sympathy it will evoke** among people. So the media published her pic, her poor home\'s photos and splashed the "poor girl scores big" narrative front and center throughout the print and TV media. \n\n2) The local mahal commitee(mosque congregation which she belongs to)and its representatives , who had pretty much ignored the family till then, **came around running with gifts and cash prizes for the poor girl, to be duly photographed and splashed around to prove their "charitable" nature**. \n\nSo the girl who should have been looking at a bright future and uplifting her family from poverty, now found the entire world judging how poor and destitute she is and she didn\'t want any of their petty sympathy ..

"Shut up. Don't be an ass, you weren't the one who employed them. Labour class people are hard to find in Kerala, and the migrants have been instrumental in filling that gap. Sure, they might stand to benefit more from that arrangement, so what, we need them too. And the workers I've met have put in efforts, out of necessity, to talk in broken Malayalam. Even if you were being sarcastic, keep it classy. We don't need to sink to Shiv Sena levels. "
"They should learn Malayalam but won't get beaten. "
'Usually what happens is they extend the line, create more routes. Once the initial investment is done, the cost dramatically goes down as I have seen in Bangalore.

There is a hardcore hindu vote base which will only vote for 'hindutva' parties on issues like cow, temple etc. This is about 20-25 % of the population. This is who the swamis and sadhvis keep happy with their prolific communal pot-stirring.\n\nThen there are the swing voters who vote on issues of development. This is around 10-15% of the electorate.

The "it will take time" argument has been floating around for way too long IMO.   \n\nThat being said, certain pride is due since these aircraft do belong to our arsenal.

'Russians used British engines on the one of their early jets like the MiG 15, they were no good at making jet engines initially so they reverse engineered it, so did the Americans. During WW2 only Britain and Germany were capable of flying combat ready jet aircraft, so after they war, it was natural for the new super powers like the US and USSR to steal, what they were lacking.  \n  \nAlso if you want to see the  mother all of reserve engineering projects look at the [American B-29](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-29_Superfortress) and [Russian Tu-4](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-4) heavy bombers. The US B-29 after bombing operation over Japan landed in the USSR becuase of technical issues instead of its base.  The Russians took the opportunity to reverse engineer it. Also some of of the early Russian tanks before Ww2 were license copies of British tanks or using American suspension technologies. '

"Lucknow to Islamabad is 1500km. The wagah border is 1000km. China can anyway only be targeted from the airfields in the north east. \n\nA jet with a snag can hardly fly 1000 km inland. Besides the road needs several hours to be prepared in advance before a plane can land.\n\nTheoretically like Israel bombed Egypt, PAF could take out Indian airfields. That's a big if - especially since they'd have to take out Delhi which is closer than Agra or Lucknow. If they get as far as Delhi they'd be dropping nukes anyway since they know what the Indian retaliation will be.\n\nPlus in combat distances are never maximized - with the use of afterburners and maneuvering tactics becoming necessary the flight range is halved. It's not a milk run.\n\nIf they'd prepared a highway near Amritsar or on Rajasthan I'd understand totally. The Agra-Lucknow route is strategic for only one reason, it is close enough for the ministers and the press in Delhi come and cheer this project."
'What conflicat zone? It shares border with Nepal and not China. By that logic of yours we should be building these airways all over the north india'
"My friend the highway mentioned here is Agra Lucknow. Open Google maps and use the scale provided and check the distance between these cities and nearest border. Fighter jets won't necessarily invade from wagah or Islamabad.\n\nMilitary around the world isn't stupid to build aerostations in the interior parts of the country and operate jets from there. Just check Indian air force bases and thier locations.\n\nA jet can develop a snag inside our territory and most of the times it's during peacetime. You can't expect to fly over foreign land during the time. Check history of milliitary crashes in India. \n\nYou assume too much. Attack can be launched anywhere and anyway to maintain the element of surprise.\n\nIf your logic is to used then having light fighters serve no purpose at all since they have a combat radius of 300 km at max. Check the basing of lca and mig 21 squadrons. Most of them are thousands of kilometres from any borders. \n\n"
"I did look at the map before commenting. Please show me a point anywhere on the Indo-Pak border that's less than 1000km from Lucknow. Effective range is 1000km, not 2700 since evasive maneuvers use a lot of fuel, and direct flight paths are never used to keep an element of surprise.\n\nA highway isn't an aerodrome. It's only in use during war when highway traffic is stopped in advance, and several hours of cleaning and setup is done. In peace time even if a plane has an emergency it can't land on the road. The usual road dividers and barricades have to be manually removed, the road swept for small stones, traffic stopped on both sides for 15 km and several more steps like that. Any plane in an emergency would crash by then.\n\nThe strip can't be used in surprise - it is a road in use.\n\nForward operating bases are activated during wartime and the planes are moved from the interior. They are located well inside the country during peacetime so they don't accidentally fly across the border and start a war.\n\n"

But there was no rule saying YOU MUST STAND. \n\nIf someone doesn't stand, who am I to question their patriotism?\n\nMaybe they have knee problems that prevent them from standing easily, maybe they're mentally ill, maybe they are showing their disapproval of the national anthem being played before movies. None of those reasons gives me any right to question them or beat them up. \n\nIf India is a great country, people will naturally feel like standing for the national anthem out of love for it without being forced to. The moment you force someone to do it, it loses meaning, because now you no longer know if they are doing it out of love or fear. \n\n"
'Actually, UNESCO has just announced that India is the most perfectest country.'
'Joke tha, bhai. But this is interesting. What is pseudopatriotism, and how does it differ from patriotism?'
"It's not just limited to people taking the law into their own hands. Even if the people around the guy who isn't standing up don't take the law into their own hands/beat him up, the person will still be fearful (because of the new law) that the police may come after him if someone complains. So again, fear is the motivation for standing, not patriotism. \n\nI'd rather live in a place where I feel like standing because I love my country and not because I'm afraid someone will file an FIR if I don't.\n\nCertain impositions do help in some places, like in education. Or keeping the streets clean.\n\nThey don't help in cases of patriotism or, as another example, charity. If you make a law requiring charity, it's not charity anymore, it's extortion, or taxes. (depending on who's asking.) Same goes for requiring demonstrations of patriotism."
'bro this FTFY is also a joke lel ... psuedopatriotism is something I made on the spot tho turns out it is a term excerpts \n\n>Pseudo Patriots are people who use patriotism as a tool to silence all criticism by anyone who does not support what majority political party thinks. These type of people tend to hate free speech unless it applies them \nThis term can not be attributed to any one political group, cause, ect. \nAnyone from Conservative to Liberal is capable of being a psuedo patriot. '
'Fair point. But it feels slightly hypocritical though that we can have free will to respect/not-respect our country or its symbols when our armed forces are given regular shots of patriotism to be on high alert in inhumane conditions to guard our boundaries for us. Mind you,  we do benefit highly from the acts of all these people. One might disagree with the policies of the current government, or maybe with the government as a whole, or maybe with the current state of things. That cannot take away the fact that we should feel proud of our nation and remember the efforts that countless individuals have put to keep us where we are now. If one  chooses not to respect the national anthem or other symbols which embody the spirit of the nation (that each of us benefit from, whether we realise it or not), then either he/she is either ignorant of what these things symbolise or does not care and in either cases the imposition in education is justified.'

'**Personhood**\n\nPersonhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law and is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.\n\nPersonhood continues to be a topic of international debate and has been questioned critically during the abolition of human and nonhuman slavery, in theology, in debates about abortion and in fetal rights and/or reproductive rights, in animal rights activism, in theology and ontology, in ethical theory, and in debates about corporate personhood and the beginning of human personhood.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24'

"India's growth with data usage and buying power has led to the decision of launching these phones in India. Sundar is a good CEO who would not take an illogical decision based on attachment to the country; he will keep the business first and take a decision based on that."
'Can someone please tell me what pixel 2 is? water resistant or waterproof? '
'then why arent they including the google home mini on preorders like in the rest of the countries'
'I was mad about buying the first Google pixel but one of my friend suggested that its not advisable to buy the first product of any company because they are basically testing the market with it. The product may have multiple flaws and it will keep evolving over a period of time. Everything he said stood true after few month from launch. '
'If Sundar actually cared he would release the rest of products in India.'
"What does this have to do with Sundar Pichai? India is a key smartphone market, probably the biggest after China. It is only natural that smartphone manufacturers are going after the India market. \n\nThe important question is how the Modi government can capitalize on this large market. Will Modi insist that foreign companies setup shop in India? Or technology transfer agreements? A large market is one of China's strongest cards when dealing with western companies. What is Modi doing?"

"Agreed. If he actually understood the market properly, the pricing would have been much more sensible. Google doesn't have as much brand or loyalty value in India, especially in the premium handset market, to command the same price as an iPhone or the Note series. IMO, it's a tad bit too high. The cheapest phone should have been below 60K. But still, do not exactly know the cost and modes of distribution so difficult to predict or forecast."
"Distribution is easy? If small boxes weighing 250 gm worth 1 lakh can't be transported, I dunno what can.\n\nIf there was a city in Antarctica, you could still make a profit selling it there.\n\nAnd china/japan/korea aren't in the list, that is surprising. Those are pretty big markets."
"Yeah maybe you are right shouldn't have put his name in the title. But why do you think the Apple & Samsung didn't do this with their iPhone 8 and the Galaxy Note 8 ? They didn't realise our market potential?\n\nNever said its because of his love but being an Indian may be he was able to see the potential. \nAlso just not him there were 2 other Indians on the stage.\n\n"

"Largely because they built nowhere close to enough units to satisfy US demand. It's not like they're not selling off inventory, they're just literally not making enough units. I suppose it's just easier to sell a few thousand units at a enormous markups in India than it is to try to have enough stock to reliably match US demand. "

"Have to disagree with you somewhat here. Son of a PSU employee here; growing up, father was transferred every 3 years on average. I'd lived in 8 different cities in 6 states by the time I graduated college (pre 2K), everywhere from Bombay to Hazaribagh. He was also transferred from a south Indian metro to small town UP when I started class 9 (we moved and I switched without too much difficulty from English to earthy Hindi for everyday conversation). He was again transferred when I was halfway through class 11, mom and I stayed put till I finished HS. Same thing when I was in the final year of college.\n\nMany government jobs come with living quarters, so finding a place to live was not a problem. Even where quarters were not available, locals were always happy to rent out nice homes to well placed government servants. Schooling can be a bit bothersome, but again, children of government employees get preference at KVs. My father believed in experiencing local colour, so I've studied at state board, CBSE and ICSE schools, depending of which was best rated where we lived.\n\nAs someone with a fair number family members in the armed forces, PSUs and civil services, I have a ton of relatives who grew up the way I did, and no one seems to be the worse for it. As a bonus, we are truly a pan-Indian family now, with various cousins marrying Tamilians, Kannadigas, Mararashtrians, Goans, Gujaratis, Punjabis and Biharis. \n\nBeing transferred is, imo, a minor inconvenience for all the perks you get. Being transferred or denied promotion because you rubbed someone the wrong way is unfair (my father and his brother (army) have both suffered from this), but so is life.\n\nEdit:\nDon't think other countries are much better this way; a friend from college, who entered the US foreign service went from DC (yay) to Colombia (uh-oh) to South Africa (eek!) to Belgium (yay) over the course of 15 years. On the plus side, his daughter is now fluent in Spanish, French and Afrikaans."
'> Hahaha , not even subtle anymore Mr haze.\n\n\n\nWhat are you trying to imply?\n\n\n\n> One has already mentioned dynasty dynasty above in the thread.\n\n\n\nI posted the same paragraph twice in this thread, just like people mentioned the same Sanjay Gandhi point multiple times.\n\n\n\n'

"And any solution trying to move the NIT from Srinagar won't work because of political reasons. "
"> If shifting of such large students is not possible to Jammu. Migrate students to different NIT's present in India. Each NIT can take 100-300 students depending on the NIT. \n\nPrevious NIT student here. I passed out of a very reputed NIT about 9 years back. It's one of the oldest ones in the country. Not disclosing location because of personal reasons. \n\nNo, migrating to another NIT is not possible immediately. It is a policy change. This needs board of governors agreement. Any sort of board meeting to change a policy goes through several ladders. Do not expect that to happen for at least a year or two. Latest knowledge of board effectiveness makes me assume it could be at least 2 years minimum.\n\nThe only possible solution is to lease a building and shifting the college there. It would normally happen within the same state. Getting that big a location for lease is not easy because colleges are not IT companies. \n\nFrom what I can see, each batch would be shifted to individual buildings scattered through the state or the neighboring states(read Punjab/Himachal). You might as well be taking classes in a local college building. Might as well have to share space with students from local colleges(could be non-engineering too).\n\nAs for the placement query I read somewhere, it is up to the placement committees. I doubt anyone in the college admin would be prioritizing placements before the real issue.\n\nI am sorry if the answers aren't satisfactory but I guess it's time for you guys to look for a new college."
'Wow this is definitely something that deserves more attention than political pressure on Coldplay concert. '
'Shift NIT Srinagar to Jammu ..this is what you need to do now. JNU is the only institution that can be ran from kashmir lol'
'Go to the library, get the good foreign text books and study. And pray.'
'The only long term solution is to ensure no space in India (or for that matter, anywhere on earth) exists for those who want to create exclusionary Muslim-only lands.\n\nWe must be working full efforts to dismantle religious oriented states - be it Pakistan, or Vatican City or Israel or Saudi Arabia.'
'ITT: You learn that randians care more about one college in one half of a state, more than they care about that half of the state itself.'
'Eh, until it impacts placements, wont matter..\n\nEnd of the day, if students end up getting degrees and placements, not much is lost'
'Yes. Tweeted to PMO, NaMo, and that Javedkar. \n\nAt least Javedkar is pretty much aware of the situation. He tweeted a few days back that 100 crore has been allotted to the development the college and Omar Abdullah should help us to reopen the college. (This was after Omar tweeted to him that why did MHRD give both IIT and IIM to Jammu. )\n\nI think this is the reason. If they shift NIT the Kashmiris will get more agitated. Also it will send out the message that situation is not normal in Kashmir, which is exactly the opposite of what these ministers want to get out in media. \n'
"And because it's a 50+ year old institute that has survived a lot. The present situation is like a pan fire compared to what it has been through."
'hope you understand mass tweeting etc dont work. grow up. things need to work within.\n\nthe whole arab spring was called as the success of twitter/so media. Look where they stand today. they are behind by 50 years.\n\nprovide some solid solution, not tweets'
"Bhai mere, this is a slightly possibly solvable problem if people create a bit of noise (shift students to other colleges or something), so it's a worthwhile cause.\n\nKashmir issue is almost unsolvable, we can't do shit about it here."
'But fuck that generation. These non-Kashmiri students are the only loyal Indians I care about. /s'
'My house is also under military occupation of Indian forces. I want to be free. I will throw my younger brother out of my house just because he was following another science book. I want to implement all the rules written into my 17th century old science book.'
"This is so heart wrenching. The least you could do is leave the children out of it. I have a question though, how exactly is the public revolting to this, especially the schools getting burnt, cos no parent would be happy with someone who burns his children's school down no matter how much he agrees with him on any other issues."
'No. Earlier it was a REC. Only Local students studied here. Mostly Kashmiris. It\'s okay for them. \n\nBut now students from **all over India come here**. \nIt only became a NIT in 2003. Atal Bihari said, "**Hey we gave you a NIT**".  What he didn\'t say was that we just changed the name of the college. \n\nSee? Earlier it was different. Now it is different \n\n'
"Thanks guys. \n\nBut we unfurled the National Flag in NIT. And got beat up by JK Police. And also trended on No 1 on Twitter. \n\nBut still nothing happened. NIT was not shifted. No teacher was suspended(including one who openly says anti-Indian things in college). No visible development till now. \n\nAll we got was that a fruit shop in NIT. Seriously. BJP govt in both Centre and State did not have the balls to unfurl the Flag in NIT. \n\nI don't think a couple of more tweets will help us now. "
'Given the decade old loha tina syllabus does any good to you.'
"There are a lot of Kashmiris obviously who are also fed up. \n\nMost of the rich people don't stay there. A lot of them have moved to Jammu and shifted their children to schools in Jammu. \n\nThe poor ones however can't afford to stay in Jammu and other cities. \n\nAnswering your question, Yes no parent would like to see schools burnt down. But this is not in their hands. \n\nThis is something stone pelters like people do. People who consider shahdat as their ultimate aim. Maybe they get paid to do this. I don't know the exact reason. \n\n"
'> But we unfurled the National Flag in NIT. And got beat up by JK Police.\n\nWhy? :/'
"No they aren't. There is no strict separation of church and state in the United Kingdom. Officially, the UK's state religion is Christianity. and the Christian Democratic Union rules Germany."

The CDU experienced considerable success gaining support from the time of its creation in Berlin on 26 June 1945 until its first convention on 21 October 1950, at which Chancellor Adenauer was named the first Chairman of the party.                         \n                                    \nIt's dishonest to claim the UK's state religion is Christianity, when they don't even have a Constitution in the first place. Obviously the initial British Governments were not secular(Being ancient and everything) but the current one is far from religious. The Church's role has been minimized but, not completely removed since that would create too much of a snafu in Parliament. A non secular state necessitates some degree of actual political power in the hands of religious leaders. Otherwise it's just words, and in words Congo is a democracy as is North Korea. "

'There is only one way to know for sure. Have a referendum.\n'
'You\'re taking a few rather grand assumptions (all 3% are protestors, all women will want to protest as well, and 6 spikes to 10 when including protestors.)\n\nBut even if this makes sense, what you\'re coming up to is 10% of the population which, in a democracy, is quite small. Obviously, the hopes and dreams of 7 lakh people are nothing to sneeze at, but there are 62 lakh other people who just want shit to get back to normal.\n\nEither way, 10 lakh is a big number, and 10% is not a miniscule percentage. So I suppose you (and I) are technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.\n\nEDIT: changed the word "liberal" to "grand," for clarity'
"[Referendum hasn't worked out spectacularly in the very, very recent past, FYI.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-are-frantically-googling-what-the-eu-is-hours-after-voting-to-leave-it/)\n\nRead a newspaper sometime, will you?

"Heh. This is what I've been saying all along: this triple talaq issue is less a case of other people infringing upon the Muslim's 'religious freedom' (as certain people make it out to be) and more a case of addressing grievances that some Muslims themselves (Muslim women to be specific) have raised.

"Well, first, people need to stop downvoting this post and have a healthy discussion on this topic. Else we shall never progress.\n\nSecond, I kind of agree with him.\n\nWhy are we still dividing the country into castes? Now I am not saying castes should be repressed or anything, but why are caste and religion and gender a basis for everything?\n\nDividing people into castes and maintaining it that way pits caste against caste which is beneficial to no one except politicians who gain votes by vote-bank politics. If castes were refused to be recognized by everyone and the system run based solely on merit, the help programs made on basis of people who are economically backward (again not reservation but scholarships), only then would India progress.\n\nThe current system is in place for 70 years. How much has the status of the people improved? Not much. Which means it is obviously flawed. \n\nMoreover, caste based reservation has multiple problems. One, the people who really need help and are really backward irrespective of their caste, can not even complete schooling. So providing reservation in jobs doesn't help them at all. The benefits of reservation are availed by the people who don't need it anymore and get undue leverage over the general population. Why does the son of a doctor or an IAS officer need reservation based on caste? They are not deprived of anything. \n\nIn addition, if one wants to help economically backward classes, give them scholarships. Reservation causes an entire caste to get jobs with less than adequate criteria. What are you saying then, that people from a certain caste have less brains? That's not true. Look at so many kids who clear IAS after studying under street lights. When you take people for less than required qualifications, it becomes a cycle, they don't study hard enough, they don't work hard enough because there are reservations in promotions as well. The load of the work falls on others, they have to study harder and work harder but get paid the same. This directly opposes the basic fundamental rights according to our Constitution - equal work for equal pay and no discrimination based on caste, creed, gender or religion. By lowering qualification standards and paying the same amount of money for unequal work violates the same things one is trying to correct through reservation. This causes the general caegory people to start despising the people who came in through reservation even if they never actually hated other castes.\n\nWhat is more, the productivity of the country suffers. With 1.2 billion people in India, the per capita productivity is a mere $1700, China is around $8000 and Germany is around $50,000. One of the reasons for this is corruption and red tape, the other is caste based reservation. Just imagine people qualifying with not even 50% marks. Imagine a doctor who has qualified with 90% marks and another with 32% marks. Would their knowledge be the same? Who would you want to be treated by? These politicians themselves want the best and the most intelligent, then what right do they have to unleash less than qualified people on the public? I am not saying that The Backwards class cannot be at the same level. But even if they can, the current system prevents them from working hard enough to achieve that; bringing down the standard of the country as a whole.\n\nLook at the number of riots each year that happen because some caste wants to be included in the reservation benefits. Look at states that have 70-96% reservation.\n\nBlacks and Hispanics have been oppressed in the US in the past but US does not have any reservation for them. They provide free programs and scholarships. I am not saying their situation is awesome but it has actually helped Blacks rise in ranks and helps more and more poor people rise up in the community every year instead of just pandering to the few who have already made it through.\n\nThe government keeps stroking this hatred and venomous desire in the economically backward class. The people from these classes should think, why has the condition not improved after decades of this program in India? It won't improve. Because if their status improves, who will the parties brainwash and collect blind votes from? Getting scholarships for people who actually deserve to be in the jobs but can't afford the education is the only way to develop this country. Anything else is a delusion and counter-productive."

We want to be national, not anti-national, for which it is important to eliminate all divisions,” the 82-year-old economist and philosopher said.\n\nReferring to Ambedkar, a former LSE student, as a “great social revolutionary and an intellectual powerhouse”, he added: “It is through education we can truly bring about change in the world. That is the vision which Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us for a united nation.”\n\n‘Dr Ambedkar’s Relevance Today and in the Future’ was organised by the Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisations UK (FABO UK) in collaboration with the Inequality and Poverty Research Programme, department of anthropology at the LSE and the India Observatory at the LSE to coincide with the centenary of Dr BR Ambedkar joining the LSE.\n\nRead | As Modi completes 2 years, a tale of 2 crematoriums at Ambedkar birthplace\n\nThe aim of the day-long conference was to bring together academics, economists, business leaders, equality champions, politicians and women leaders to highlight the relevance of Ambedkar’s work on the economic and social reforms in India and beyond.\n\n“London holds a special place in the life of Babsaheb Ambedkar and his home at King Henry’s Road will serve as memorial dedicated to social justice. He was a great intellectual, jurist, human rights champion who struggled against all odds in his goal of nation-building. The best way to honour him is to try and follow his ideals,” said Dr Virander Paul, the deputy high commissioner of India to the UK.\n\nRead | In Hyderabad, Kanhaiya pitches for ‘Rohith Act’ to end casteism\n\nAmbedkar, referred to as the architect of the Indian Constitution, registered for a master’s degree and took courses in Geography and Political Ideas alongside Social Evolution and Social Theory and went on to complete a PhD thesis at LSE.\n\nThe year 2016 marks the centenary of his first visit to LSE in 1916.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"Poor Sen. He might want to jump on and deploy the anti-national argument but he's on the wrong side of the fence there. People are not going to take an 'anti-national' phirang prize winner seriously. That term is the problem as are the people who use it.\n\nShould a retired general call caste anti-national...that would be powerful. "
'The alternative to abolishing caste, is to accept caste as a matter of fate/karma/what-have-you, and start doing good deeds to be reborn into a better caste. So a guy who belong to a shitty caste will not complain or want reservations, but just do good deeds.\n\nIs this even realistic? Of course not. So the only option is to actively abolish caste as a concept in every aspect of society. Organize trips for people of lower castes to go to places frequent by people of higher caste. Promote marriage between people of high/low castes. And so on. '

">Why are we still dividing the country into castes? Now I am not saying castes should be repressed or anything, but why are caste and religion and gender a basis for everything?\n\nBecause such divisions exist in social fabric, just because you close your eyes, the monster in front of you doesn't disappear. Reservations/quotas are a band-aid fix for caste inequality (or gender or race, etc). \n\n>If castes were refused to be recognized by everyone\n\nWhen this happens, then let us talk of removing reservations/quotas. But no change happens instantaneously. And especially in a conservative/socially backward country like India, this is even more the case. Going by genetic research, caste endogamy has been going on for about 1900 years now, such deep culture can only change generation by generation.\n\n>and the system run based solely on merit,\n\nMerit is a very subjective thing, and is dependent on the nature of the job. In India, where there is a severe shortage of (formal sector) job openings and a huge oversupply of potential employees(job seekers), employers tend to raise the bar(standard of merit) above the actual minimum merit required. At entry levels, applying different standards of merit for different quota classes doesn't reduce productivity by much (infact, in certain jobs, diversity improves productivity). \n\n>The current system is in place for 70 years. How much has the status of the people improved? Not much. Which means it is obviously flawed.\n\nThe status of backward castes has improved, more of them are tax payers now, and going by NSSO data, the average household expenditure of dalits has risen from 34% to 37% of forward castes in a decade. Slow, but there is progress. What system do you want to replace it with? How is it better than the current one?\n\n> the people who really need help and are really backward irrespective of their caste, can not even complete schooling. So providing reservation in jobs doesn't help them at all. \n\nYour assertion is that reservation is being accessed solely by the upper sections of the backward castes. I'm going to say you came to this conclusion after cherry-picking from your personal anecdotes. I have seen many instances of reservations(in education) where they benefited from that chance/opportunity provided to them. In college, a friend of mine got admitted through SC/ST quotas, while I didn't qualify for it(OBC creamy layer). At the end of 4 years, he graduated with a 8.5(well placed, had 2 research papers, was an influential leader and organizer of many events), while I graduated with 6.8.\n\n> Why does the son of a doctor or an IAS officer need reservation based on caste? They are not deprived of anything.\n\nIndividually they are not deprived of anything, but as a community they are, in more ways than you can imagine. \n\n>In addition, if one wants to help economically backward classes, give them scholarships.\n\nalready happening, always happened, but is not enough as is evidenced by only marginal improvements in social status.\n\n> Reservation causes an entire caste to get jobs with less than adequate criteria.\n\nLess than the criteria arrived at by open competition, not necessarily less than the criteria required for the job. For examples, lets say I'm employing some(say 4) 'data-entry' positions based on some standardized test where the job requires a minimum of 6.0 score. But because, there are 15 people applying for it, I decided to raise the bar to 7.5 for interviews. Now of all the applicants the top 4 were 9.0, 8.8, 8.8, 8.5, and I reserved one position for someone from disadvantaged social background, the highest from that demographic being 7.2. So, I hire the people with scores 9.0, 8.8, 8.8 and 7.2. It is less than the standard I set for interviews, but not necessarily less than the actual standard.\n\n>This directly opposes the basic fundamental rights according to our Constitution - equal work for equal pay and no discrimination based on caste, creed, gender or religion. By lowering qualification standards and paying the same amount of money for unequal work violates the same things one is trying to correct through reservation. \n\nThis applies during the job not at the time for employment. You are not entitled to a job, you have no inherent right to a certain job position(other than MNREGA). It is the employers decision who to hire. Now while on the job, if you were mistreated, that is a case for discrimination lawsuit, but not at the time of employment. \n\n>This causes the general category people to start despising the people who came in through reservation even if they never actually hated other castes.\n\nWhatever you are feeling now, the lower castes have always felt. Do you think the same when disabled people(can't walk) are selectively provided provided escalators at a small shopping mall?\n\n>What is more, the productivity of the country suffers.\n\nNo. There was research that shows, in most projects it is just the top 5% people making the most of effort and progress towards the end goal. The productivity of any group is pretty much decided by the small group of top performers, the others are there to fill the gaps and perform the enabling role. Reservation/quotas don't touch the top performers, only bottom performers. You are sacrificing marginal productivity for social inclusion. \n\n>Blacks and Hispanics have been oppressed in the US in the past but US does not have any reservation for them. They provide free programs and scholarships. \n\nThat is not true, please educate yourself before talking. Hispanics have quotas in states where they have a sizable population. Blacks have racial quotas of 10% for federal contractors, when their population is 14%. (Compare it to OBC - 41%population/24%quota and SC/ST - 24%p/15%q.) Even most private firms and universities in US have affirmative action policies, where they try to meet certain racial/ethnic diversity goals. (source: I live in the US currently)\n\n>why has the condition not improved after decades of this program in India? \n\nNo, it has already improved. Household income and spending of SC/STs has improved roughly 2% per decade when compared to FCs. Note that the improvement is in the average of all households, even though not all use quotas. It is a small step towards equality, but one that is needed. \n\n\n>Getting scholarships for people who actually deserve to be in the jobs but can't afford the education is the only way to develop this country.\n\nThis is already happening and has always happened since independence.\n\n"
'> Why are we still dividing the country into castes? \n\nYeah, while right to equality is a fundamental right ! \n\n> Dividing people into castes and maintaining it that way pits caste against caste which is beneficial to no one except politicians who gain votes by vote-bank politics\n\nDivide & Rule.

"Me too agreed, let's ask govt to not record any caste of any person. "
'I actually quite like 2nd para, and feel litigation is the way forward. As an instance, if you are discriminated  on the basis of your caste say in an religious institution, then you should be able to sue the shit out of that institution and demand compensation, a la the US model, I suppose ( minimum compensation of say 50 lakhs or more). Want to become a priest, but cannot becuz the particular training body only accepts Brahmins, sue the shit out of them. \n\nAlso, as it stands; endogamous marriages within communities and castes is one of the main reasons for the promulgation of the caste system in India.'
"Sikhs kinda do it. They have Singh or Kaur depending on gender. But caste still finds a way somehow. Some families proud of their caste sprinkle it over their name, or when it comes to marriages they ask for it. And rarely (villages) there exist 2 gurudwaras, one for lower one for higher caste.\n\nBut to be honest Sikhs, in general, are doing alright when it comes to caste. \n\nNo matter what solution you use, until the mentality changes, there's no way around. And that is very hard. Today we debate over caste, tomorrow religion, then colour, then gender, then ethnicity, then nationality. We can't just make all the variations that exist in nature (except caste isn't natural) one, externally, but we can at least look at them as one. It's funny how nature wasn't diverse enough for Indians that we made up caste from thin air.\n\n*Thick tear drops from one eye, not too fast, not too slow* \n\nPS: Sikhi in theory has no place for castes as such. The Panj Pyaare were of all different castes, to whom 10th Guru knelt to and drank the Amrit from. 11th Guru (Guru Granth) has verses written from several authors of different religions and castes, to whom Sikhs and other devotees bow head down to."
'Got any evidence of that? Every article I read says there have  helped a lot. Even the wiki shows that they have helped increase participation in the public sector.'
"You answered all the things that I wanted to. Good job mate.\n\nOn a side note people don't really realize the privilege that they are born into. When everyone around you agrees with your belief, it creates a reinforcing loop but that also indicates that there isnt much diversity within your groups to look at the other side."
'Merit is not something you can decide on in my opinion. When I conduct I interviews, I try to interview as many candidates as possible. From that pool, I choose the best 4 (assuming there are 4 positions). That then becomes my merit list. It does not matter what the caste, creed, religion, gender or gotra these 4 candidates come from. To me, this is equality. Everybody competing in equal ground. \n\nI mean, on the one hand we say that there will be no discrimination on the basis of caste while on the other hand we discriminate on the basis of caste. It does not matter which way the discrimination goes, it will still be discrimination. '
'Okay, all of your own examples are the result of cherry picking and a result of probable repressed hate for other castes over the years. \n\nIf you are employing people with 9, 8.9, 8.7 and 7.2, you are not selecting the best for the job. That is discrimination. Plus that is not even close to what is happening. While people from general category with 90% marks are being rejected, people from SC/ST with mere 4% are also selected. Very just and prodctive. Your assertion clearly shows you have no idea of the Indian Constitution and what it says. It provides not just equality of status but also of opportunity. "Equality Edit This envisages that no section of the society enjoys special privileges and individuals are provided with adequate opportunities without any discrimination".  The lower marks being accepted for a job is unequal opportunity and special treatment for a class, hence, unconstitutional. Also, your assumption is that there are like 9 seats based on merit and 1 seat is reserved while the truth is there are 7 seats reserved and only 3 that are open. \n\nPlus reservation was always temporary, only for a period of 10 years. But due to vote bank politics, people have started thinking that they are just automatically entitled to it even if they are economically well off just because they can.\n\nYour answer to years of oppression of lower castes is to oppress the oppressors? Very intelligent policy. Let\'s just keep the poison of castes in the society, let\'s just change who oppresses whom.\n\nNo one is oppressed in any way or form once they reach VIP status.\n\nI have my coworkers, half of them admitted through quotas who refuse to work and all of that work not done is thrown on our heads. Whenever a complaint is raised against them for not working and roaming about to pick up their kids or go shopping in office hours, they yell, "we are being oppressed because we are sc/st/obc." ridiculous. This is discrimination and in every way counter-productive.\n\nWhat about when reserved category seats go vacant and one random year filling SC/ST backlog hogs all the seats?\n\nAnd by your own assertion, if these communities are still facing problems, then again, the system has not worked. Caste based reservation only highlights casteism further. If the only merit was the criteria (which is just as objective as at least caste) caste, religion and gender would cease to be a factor.\n\nAnd by your assertion, only lower castes are suppressed. Not the poor people from upper castes. This assertion is flawed in itself. The current system does nothing to help those people while the people who are economically sound can reap undue benefits. The fact that an economically sound person needs reservation because their sentiments are still hurt is an argument of a snowflake hungry for undue leverage, nothing else.\n\nPeople are not getting scholarships. The jobs are either sold to influential people or reserved for under qualified people. They are never given to people who deserve them based on merit. The fact that merit is not important is the argument of an anti-intellectual who cannot achieve the desired ranks needed for the job. Every developed nation runs on a merit based system despite their social problems. Which is the sole reason they are developed and India is still struggling to sustain itself.\n\nIf you want to look at the data, poor population in India is improving at 0.87% per decade while the rich have improved 300%. That is not a good statistic. The rich-poor income and opportunity gap have only increased. The productivity per capita for the rich has increased but for the middle and lower income groups has decreased over the decades. So please try to actually analyse data before spewing it for propaganda. A merit based scholarship system would be a much better step towards equality that would improve the condition of the poor in proportion to that of the economically sound people. '
"Also, to add to the debunking of your skewed claims, the upliftment of the SC/ST that you talk about was not brought about by reservation but by the meritocratic opportunities in the private sector that is the driving force of the Indian economy. \n\nContrary to popular propaganda, people who get through into the private sector, flourish well irrespective of their caste and vice versa the private sectors flourishes more than the government sector because of it.\n\nPlus, because of unequal opportuinities due to reservations and corruption, meritorious students seek opportunities abroad in more meritocratic countries. This causes brain drain and efflux of talent which again, harms India as these people have studied in India but will produce returns in other countries. And don't go blaming these people. Even if they were to stay in India, they would not have been given the opportunity. So, basically, it only harms the country."
'Also, educate yourself about Indian cinstitution by reading this: https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/02/educational-reservations-india-solutions/\n\nPlus, there is something else that has been in place from Independence - the Provision Against Atrocities Act. If only discrimination at the workplace is a discrimination, then why have reservation at all? This act will take care of the discrimination, no? Your assertions show your cognitive dissonance.'
'What you are taking of is affirmative action to bridge inequality. Some states like countries in the EU, go by the doctrine of equal opportunity wherein all caste based anything is illegal. That is by far, the most successful model and the one I have been harping on about.\n\nThe one in the US gives scholarships to underprivileged people and urges people to select a "diverse" group of individuals. The implementation is upto the employers. SO, mostly employers would pick an Asian over an American white or a lesbian over a straight male when ***All other qualifications are equal***. They never lower the bar on the requirements.\n\nThe reservation in the form as in India is not practised in the developed nations because it causes more harm than good.\n\nI am not opposed to affirmative action but the way it is implemented in India. I am all for reducing inequality but there are so many better ways that provide equal opportunity based on the metrics of the real world and not just a caste that one was born in irrespective of everything else because there are a number of factors that stand between a person and equal opportunity than just heritage. Rich people changing rules so that only high paying influential people can get some jobs is just as bad as reservation and both need to be eliminated and replaced with better systems for affirmative action and the development of the nation as a whole.'
'That is not true. While the higher income groups (top 10%) have improved 300% over the years, lower income groups (bottom 50%) have improved only 0.87%. The improvement is flawed for only the poor, not for the rich.'
'Correct. I think Islam, too, has played such a huge part in bringing the people of India together over centuries. :)'
'Yes all the other countries without caste are shining beacons of equality without any racism or class structures. '
"Look there is no arguing that caste system started the inequality. But we need to abolish this system, making reservations on caste system is just like preserving it.\n\nAnd about supporting EBC, why I don't see anything then. Because when they start giving support to EBC the reservation for caste will not be even needed cause every poor will be included under such reservation regardless of caste."
'I hope he was being sarcastic in the first para.'
'Yeah now I recall where I heard it first.'
"Or, let's stop using reservations within government jobs and services - where the focus needs to be on efficient job performance and accountability. Reservations within sectors that can uplift communities might be better - government can create SEZs or jobs that provide socioeconomic benefits and cap reservations within those. The growth in our civil services is not matching the growth in population. Let sectors that can grow be made more inclusive.\n\n* not suggesting reservation within private sector "
'> Got any evidence of that? Every article I read says there have helped a lot. Even the wiki shows that they have helped increase participation in the public sector.\n\n\nGot any peer reviewed article in a journal? Wiki and newspapers do not count. \n\n> helped increase participation in the public sector\n\nThat does not mean that the caste system is going away. '
'I get that privilege is hard to recognize, especially for young 20-30 year olds. The only ones I hear whining about unfairness of reservation are young upper caste kids. As long as caste discrimination happens in India, we will need positive discrimination policies.'
"One side people don't realise the undue privilege they get based on reset=rvation, on the other, they do nothing to help other oppressed people in their own caste and on the third, they bash general category people for more and more greed of undue leverage. When everyone around you agrees with your belief, it creates a reinforcing loop but that also indicates that there isn't much diversity within your groups to look at the other side. Apply that to yourself. Normal people have more than required diversity. Good job, dividing the country."
"no they are not equal.\n\nStraight up just wealth alone decides which person even shows up for the job interview. Many really rich kids would have gone on to better jobs and and better colleges with just knowing who to talk to.\n\nThats just one example of shenanigans at the top end of the curve - the part that no one is even bothered by.\n\nThe issues at the bottom?\n\n1) Child development is directly related to parental education. The better read a parent the more significant the improved scores in children. Guess what happens if your parents are uneducated\n\n(see also word-gap)\n\n2) linguistic skills and comfort in a language depend on parental involvement and ability. \n\n3) Mental development depends on nutrition and *maternal* nutrition. So if the girl child was underfed, and came from an OBC group - the kid is walking up an extra steep incline.\n\n\nNow lets assume, that one of the kids who survives all of that, and shows up in front of you for a job. \n\nHe is going to be competing with say, 4 normal kids who didnt ever have to deal with any of those problems. \n\nIF those 4 kids were just average, they would do better than the average OBC kid who shows up in front of you.\n\nIf the OBC kid was superlative, and studied his ass off, had more drive than a 3000 kW engine, he would come close to being as informed or well trained as the other normal kids. \n\nBut his polish, soft skills or other tertiary skills could be still lacking.\n\nIf you worked on pure merit - just scores, or achievements, it would end up undervaluing the effort required for someone to walk twice the distance to reach the same finish line.\n\n---\n\nAll of the above, is just about basic child development. I haven't even brought up things which caste alone can do. Like not let you show up for a job. Or co-workers who insult you, or expect you to behave a certain way, or make it clear you arent welcome, or customers who dont want to work with you, or assault for trying to get a job.\n\n"
'Yes, this is positive affirmation based on equality of opportunity and that is how it should be.'
">Plus that is not even close to what is happening. While people from general category with 90% marks are being rejected, people from SC/ST with mere 4% are also selected.\n\nThis should tell you how oppressed those castes are, how many social disadvantages they must have had to score so badly while being more populous than the upper castes. This is a sad remainder of caste inequality to those idiots saying caste system is already abolished.\n\n >Your assertion clearly shows you have no idea of the Indian Constitution and what it says\n\nSupreme court on numerous counts has upheld the reservation policies and has only sought to place an upper limit on percentage of seats reserved for backward communities. It seems you have an impeccable understanding of the Indian constitution, please go argue your case in the supreme court.\n\n > truth is there are 7 seats reserved and only 3 that are open.\n\nReservations are capped at 50%.\n\n>Your answer to years of oppression of lower castes is to oppress the oppressors? Very intelligent policy. Let's just keep the poison of castes in the society, let's just change who oppresses whom.\n\nAsk yourself honestly if it is fair to compare reservation policies to what subjugation and oppression lower castes have historically faced, just think about that. Besides nobody is violating any of your rights(going by supreme court verdict), we are just providing additional opportunity to disadvantaged social groups who were socially denied opportunity for so long. You are not being banned from applying to a position, just the number of seats available to you is reduced. If an upper caste, living a privileged life with no social caste disadvantages (with social connections and advantages infact), doesn't qualify for open positions, he/she can't really claim to be meritorious.\n\n>No one is oppressed in any way or form once they reach VIP status.\n\nTIL SC/ST are VIPs\n\n> work not done is thrown on our heads. \n\nThat would have happened even if they were not reserved seat candidates. In most teams, work is not shared equally, the top performers do most important part, and the others fill in the gaps and enable them. This is why reservation doesn't show drops in productivity. Infact there is research to show that diverse teams are more productive.\n\n>system has not worked. Caste based reservation only highlights casteism further. If the only merit was the criteria (which is just as objective as at least caste) caste, religion and gender would cease to be a factor.\n\nIt has worked, albeit slowly. If you have a proposal that would help caste inequality even better then please share it with us. We can't have religion quotas on a broad scale because it is a variable parameter, people can convert. Though I'm surprised we don't have gender quotas, in my opinion we should have, its only fair (no I'm not a feminist, but do agree with some of their points). Quotas are a tool to fasten social inclusion, it only helps the economy in the long run, where it is gender inclusion or caste inclusion.\n\n>And by your assertion, only lower castes are suppressed. Not the poor people from upper castes. Thee current system does nothing to help those people while the people who are economically sound can reap undue benefits. \n\nIs it really that hard to understand? Caste reservations are a fix for caste inequality not income inequality. Low income scholarships are a fix for income inequality, there are plenty \navailable. You know what is the biggest differentiating factor in groups for median purchasing power? Its caste, not income, not gender. Intuition tells, it would be income, but that is factually not the case. The difference in median purchasing power in poor India half and the not poor India half is far less than the difference in median purchasing power between lower castes and upper castes. That is how deep and entrenched caste inequality is in India. \n\n>The fact that merit is not important is the argument of an anti-intellectual who cannot achieve the desired ranks needed for the job. \n\nMerit is very subjective, it is something that quantifies the capacity of a person to perform. There are a numerous tonne of ways in which we can quantify a person's potential performance. I can confidently say, the way in which government bodies calculate merit is already very flawed (their shit tests don't count for jack-shit in actual performance). Even many private employers calculate merit very superficially, they can afford to do this because market is over-saturated with job-seekers.\n\n>Every developed nation runs on a merit based system despite their social problems. \n\nEvery developed country has affirmative action polices, some even mandate the private owners to set diversity goals. The development of a country is generally directly correlated with its performance on social equality(be it race/gender/caste).  \n\n>Which is the sole reason they are developed and India is still struggling to sustain itself.\n\nYes the only reason India is backward is because of reservation! Not because of shitty politicians (like Modi), not because of conservative minded people who oppose social reform on caste inequality and gender inequality, not because of a corrupt bureaucracy, not because Victorian laws, only because of reservation. Jesus.\n\n>If you want to look at the data, poor population in India is improving at 0.87% per decade while the rich have improved 300%. That is not a good statistic. The rich-poor income and opportunity gap have only increased. The productivity per capita for the rich has increased but for the middle and lower income groups has decreased over the decades.\n\nIncome inequality is a different issue than caste inequality. Caste reservations are for rectifying injustice that is caste inequality. There are already many policies for addressing income inequality. (If you are passionate about it, then vote for politicians addressing income inequality, go participate in seminars and mock parliaments.) Similarly others who are passionate about caste inequality in our society will try to address this problem. Caste is the single most important parameter that stratifies you in a society, so for me it would take priority over other parameters (even gender, income-level, etc).\n\n\n"
'>If only discrimination at the workplace is a discrimination, then why have reservation at all?\n\nReservation is a fix for social discrimination that has been going on forever. Workplace(obviously after employment) discrimination will be taken care of by workplace discrimination/harassment laws. '
'> I think Islam, too, has played such a huge part in bringing the people of India together over centuries.\n\nSuppose it has in one way, with the Northern Indian Muslim rule (especially with Mughals) and then united forces against the Mughals, see Marathas and Sikhs/Dogras/Punjabi Rajputs.\n\nThen again, it created Pakistan and Bangladesh too.

The members left no stone unturned to make the event a memorable one - with rainbow flags, balloons and celebratory dhol beats, the streets of Lucknow wore a happy and gay look. Slogans like \'My Body My Rights\', \'Humari Azadi Hum Chheen Ke Lengey\', \'Hum Jhoom Ke Lengey\' and \'I am Gay and It\'s Okay!\' made several passersby stop their vehicles and capture the moment on their phone cameras.(BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Starting from Sikandarbagh Chauraha, the 1.5km parade, which culminated at the Gandhi Park in Hazratganj, saw the participation of members of the LGBTIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and asexual) community from not only Lucknow, but all over the country. A happy and surprised Venkatesh, who came all the way from Kolkata to be a part of the parade, said, "I am amazed to see so many people from our community turning up for this parade.

And we have a tendency to hero-worship; always believing that one hero will solve all our problems. This is also reflected in the movies, particularly the older ones, where a hero saves a whole village or a nation from corrupt and evil politicians or businessmen.\n\n\nWe need clearly defined right to free speech, which at it's core includes the right to criticize any policy without fear of backlash from the govt or public servants. In this case, the SP should be brought to book and investigated, to get to the root cause of suspension, and if the allegation is true, the SP should be dismissed for wrongful termination and restriction of free speech of a subordinate. \n\nOn a different note, always take such news articles with a grain of salt.

'> Just noise and no substance. \n\nYou seem to be confusing the BJP with the Congress. Even as the opposition, the Congress has delivered on its promise. Rahul Gandhi promised that he wouldn\'t allow Modi to modify and pass a new land bill that would allow Modi to steal any Indian\'s, especially poor farmers, land and give it to the corporate rich. He delivered. He promised to stop Modi\'s juggernaut in Bihar and he delivered. Even in the recent elections, the Congress has done extremely well even if they lost UP (a state where they weren\'t really strong). Congress said they wouldn\'t block the GST - even if the BJP\'s GST is inferior to its own - just for the sake of opposing it, like the BJP did. And they behaved like a responsible opposition and ensured the GST bill\'s passage, among many other bills.\n\nThe problem with the Congress is not with their leader or its policy - it is that the corporate owned media dances to Modi\'s tune because only Modi will make them richer. And Modi will do anything for them - in the name of "development" - as he has proved time and again. But *Jumlas* will work only for so long. You will find that in the last 3 years Modi has had to resort to bribes and threats to win elections in many state, as his popularity keeps falling among the Indians. '

It's not for nothing that they went to a total noob Rajiv Gandhi to become their leader after Indira's death."
'> Rahul Gandhi promised to democratise the Congress. Whatever happened to that?\n\nOne of the reason was he was sabotaged from within the Congress by those who wanted to maintain the status quo. Let me give you an example - I was in TN when the youth congress polls were being held there. While chatting with a high ranking congress leader, he got a call from one of his constituency that one of the new youth congress member is unhappy that he had been asked to back another contestant (this \'leaders\' candidate). And this guy had decided to contest the election too. Immediately the \'leader\' asked him how many others would back him and got the reply that more than enough to defeat their candidate and ensure his win. You know what he does next? Calls a DMK politician, and asks him, "Hey, I need a favour - can you send me 100 of your youth members for this IYC election." And of course his candidate won, with a large majority. \n\nAnd the other newbie IYC guy, quit. And that\'s again the other issue. This leader told me that every day he and others get 100\'s of calls from people who want to join the Congress because of Rahul Gandhi. In TN, I think they got 15+ lakh new IYC members, if I remember right. I\'d say maybe 10% may have been fake members. Still, why didn\'t the remaining 10+ lakh members make a difference in TN?\n\nThe Congress, being a mass based party doesn\'t have "brainwashing sessions" for its cadre, like the left or the right. You have to learn politics on the job. Kind of like an internship. But most newbie members just didn\'t have the patience for it or the social skills for the "pay your dues" policy that is part of any professional setup. And those who did, like the newbie IYC guy I mentioned above, gave up too soon.'

"Congress was in a leadership crisis in mid '90s until Sonia Gandhi (the _reluctant_ politician) came along and led it to back-to-back wins.\n\nINC has associated itself with a Nehru-Gandhi identitfy for so long that it doesn't know what it is without that identity.\n\nRegional leaders can play regional identity cards to secure votebanks.\n\nUPA tried a ragtag combination of dalits, muslims etc. on a national level, but now that BJP has secured the biggest and baddest votebank of them all (Hindus, for those still thinking), they don't know what hit them.\n\nIt is all still a sign of a very immature, young and uninformed level of politics.

An eg. of this attempt, the price of goods is now marked as MRP instead of MRP + Tax as it has always been. Are they (the government) trying to hide themselves by not 'highlighting' their cut?\n\nWhy is the effort of enforcing a rule between Modi, Chief Ministers and common populace, a rule that forces the comman man to give a part of his consumption directly to Modi and Chief Ministers, the job of the trader/manufacturer/creator and not the 2 parties directly involved (government and comman man) ?\n\nA trader wants to sell a good, a buyer wants to consume it.

MRP screws both businesses and consumers. \n\n1) MRP for Bengal, Gujarat, TN and Punjab is same. Is that really in consumer's advantage? Transport costs are not same for every nook and corner of India. So in the end, one part of India ends up subsidizing another part because of an archaic law.\n\n2) Product cost to wholesalers is far below MRP. But due to collusion, that advantage is not passed onto consumers.

The Deputy Chairman of NITI Aayog, the now-departed Dr. Panagariya, was apparently not advised either. These were some of the very few professional economists who are actually in the cabinet at the time. Instead, Modi relies on a small coterie of sycophants in the PMO, many of whom are not even professional economists and some who are outright quacks.

"\nI see it differently. If Chidambaram really wanted to give advice to the current government he could just make a call to Modi or Defence Minister. I think BJP will value any suggestion on these situations. Saying things in public doesn't fetch you anything.\n\n\n Now Pakistan media will run this news on their media. World has already has a quite confused view of the Kashmir situation. No one from Pakistan is making such statements but only Indians are making such statements. If I am a stranger I would definitely think India is the one who occupied Kashmir. I am not saying we were extremely good with Kashmir. But Kashmir is a important state going by the demographics too. India cant lose Kashmir at any cost. Instead of speaking about the development in the valley and making them comfortable the stance taken by Congress and communists is worsening the situation. \n\nConsider the situation at JNU. Umar khalid and Lenin clearly said on national media that they wont believe in Yakub Menon's execution and Supreme court murdered him. You may argue that it was BJP propaganda. But had that happened in Saudi Arabia or America or any other country the action taken by government would have been far worse. The case will be pursued but they would have been taken into custody right away. But the hate towards BJP made opposition parties to unite and support them. Now world may think what those students were saying was indeed right. \n\nOpposition parties must speak of development and things which make Kashmiris comfortable towards India not how many of them started hating us. \n"

So, not really like Himachal in that respect. Just that they also don't allow outsiders to buy property and settle down there. "
"Congress didn't root for Uniform Civil Code, building Ram Mandir or repealing section 370. BJP does. But, in 8-9 year old rule, they haven't taken a single serious step towards any of these three things.\n\nThat makes you question their commitment to these issues.

'Only better, because he spending the shit load of of cash that was meant for two states. '
'Indeed, AIADMK is not that much different from DMK when it comes to economics, both of them are Left-of-Center (by National standards), it is in the social sphere where AIADMK is right-wing. It also gets most of the upper caste votes in TN while DMK pockets the Dalit vote handsomely. \n'

"I was using ola cabs for 2 weeks last year and it was surprising to me that 9 out of 10 cabbies are unprofessional and don't really care anything about but money. Only twice in the 20 rides I took, I came across a good cabbie, who is professional, shares his humble story and also behaves like this. \n\nIn my case, it was raining and the street was pretty narrow and he would have to reverse downhill for about 50 metres in dark. So, I asked him to stop at the large street, but he insisted on dropping me at the gate and reversed only after he saw me get inside. Such a humble guy and he was getting close to getting his own vehicle at that time. Hope he got his own vehicle by now. \n\nThe other humble cabbie bought his new car, but didn't like driving in the city. He would rather have long rides to other towns, either daily or multiple day rentals. He was also very pleasant through out the ride.\n\nThere was one more guy who was friendly in talk, but very unprofessional, as he arrived 20 minutes late, then stopped the car mid flight citing that ola didn't start the trip. He stopped the car by the side, restarted the mobile to see the trip was still on and then took his own sweet little time maneuvering the roads. I honestly don't mind if a driver isn't pleasant to me, but being unprofessional is a no no. In another instance, the cabbie was cutting too many corners to avoid going till the signal and taking a u turn. He reversed in the middle of the road in half traffic to find a spot to get into the opposite lane, twice!"
"Every Uber driver I've interacted with has been an absolute gem. They help with luggage, make pleasant conversation and the cars are always in perfect shape."
'And it seems they are engaged now, look at her profile pic.'
"Ola is horrible. I feel ashamed to call it an Indian company. Uber, I've had 95% of good experiences with. In Vietnam, I got a Uber and my hotel was in a small lane where only two wheeler traffic could pass through. Driver parked the car, unloaded my luggage and helped me cross a busy street in Vietnam. All this with no tip. \n\nUber is not perfect but I believe it does (at least for now) make a sincere effort to improve quality. We should reward companies which do."
'She took the driver to Times Square too? See, kindness is always rewarded!'
"Ikr, I first open Uber and see if there's surge pricing on, and if it's very expensive I then open Ola and only then I use Ola. Otherwise, Uber is a lot better and professional. "
"I used Uber exclusively for almost 7-8 months for my daily commute too. Now I only use Ola. Ola Prime's quality is amazing, and the drivers have been great 9/10 times. Though they do cancel sometimes if you want to go to Noida, as do Uber drivers, because they charge Rs. 150/day for entry by commercial vehicles and both Uber/Ola don't compensate for it. I don't go to Noida, but I have enquired with multiple drivers about why the destination matters.\n\n\n\nGet Ola Select, and you are never charged surge and get Prime/Play at Mini rates, along with priority when booking a cab."
'Well uber has compliments like if you give 5 stars to some driver, you can give a compliment to them aswell like 6star service, great attitude, maintained car etc. '

'A male-dominated audience want a local male set of actors who act all macho and superman, alongside a exotic female actress, who doesn\'t need to act but can just pass on with skinshow and women-objectifying dances.\n\nAdd hero-worship to this shit, and caste obession for some people, and you would understand why the movie industry has gone to the dogs, which was once very good. The last surviving popular "art"form that most people are genuinely interested in this part of the nation is cinema, and this stops it from going beyond our boundary.\n\nThis means Telugu cinema will remain shit, while the same audience will eat up new stuff from say other industries, or Hollywood or Bollywood. It\'s good to see new directors coming up who have quality in their movies, nice shots, and proper voice acting and actors as well. As far as actors go, Vijay Deverakonda is a gem. His acting in Arjun Reddy was a lot better than other so called Powerstars or Superstars.'
"This is why the adulation over education kits issued to *sathiya* volunteers that allegedly say 'it is okay for adolescents to get attracted to someone of the same sex', is very misplaced. BJP created *hawa* with that one measure but will slyly promote homophobia at many levels in society and administration thus eventually suppressing the LGBT community."

'yeah, maybe something like netflix can grab it up!'
'Well, ideally all movies should be released online the same time as cinemas, but there is a lot of resistance from the theatre owners and distributors, ergo, there is no market for online release ATM.

"It's like the party is made up by many people"
"That is a popular, yet misleading quote. It's usually thought that younger people are by definition more liberal, but that is coming from a Western prism, because that has been the experience there.\n\nOTOH, if you look at the Arab & muslim world, many younger people today are *more* intolerant than their parents were in the 50s or 60s when they were their age. Just look at old photos from Cairo university from the 1950s until the mid-2000s\n\n[It's very telling](http://www.democraticunderground.com/10024727575).\n\nAlso, didn't we have a story about religious projections until 2050 on this sub yesterday? The share of atheists as a percentage of all people is projected to *decrease* from here until then. Meaning the world will become less rational and more religious/conservative. That's not progress.\n\nPeople should be careful using the Western experience as a guide. India could very well be more religious/conservative in 30 years from now than it was, say, 5 years ago. The march is progress is not linear nor is it guaranteed. Nothing is certain or cast in stone, which is why that funeral quote is kind of stupid."
'Nice idea'
"It will be better than to not release the film at all, isn't it?

"Earlier an 8W LED Bulbs from reputed companies used to cost upwards of Rs 250. Then came the EESL sponsored subsidized bulbs for Rs 100. I bought 3 last year in July. I bought 3. 2 are gone. 1 still working. Bought a Philips 8W LED bulb a few days back. Costed Rs 150. My take. In a way the massive EESL scheme helped brought the prices down. Lot of people probably bought their first LED bulbs during that scheme. Where I live it was big. Not Jio big, but still big. There were EESL vans throughout the town and you would find some crowd every time you see. Brand me a bhakt but it was one of few good things Modi government has done.In a sense, LED bulbs became mainstream and economies of scale further brought down the prices. LED bulbs are much affordable now and believe me, Irfan Khan's adverts had no hand in achieving that."

'Well it also can be said that the scheme was timed and implemented considering the falling LED prices so government would not get a huge loss. It is just about being aware of the coming opportunities and banging onto them. Just my thought : current govt came to power seeking the opportunity to overcome people concern about the country growth and development, so its just sailing over the same sentiments of the people and along the way collecting some said achievements and credits which are given by the people.

'LEDs are in huge demand not just in India but worldwide. Other governments are subsidizing LEDs as well. Also, technological improvements have a lions share in bringing down the prices and increasing efficiency of LEDs.'
'It is not subsidized. Because of huge orders from the government and competition companies lowered their bids and led bulbs became cheap. '
"He quite clearly claimed that it has come down from Rs 350 during UPA2 to Rs 40 now due to his government's efforts. That is not the truth. It would have happened irrespective of whatever the government did because LED prices worldwide are going down due to technological advances."
"I am pretty sure it's not Rs300. If it is in your area, that's just your dealer trying to get rid of older stock, which he must have bought at a higher cost.\n\nYes, economies of scale ensure that prices of LEDs have come down. Do you think India is the only country buying and subsidizing LEDs? Also, don't discount the role of technological advances in price reduction."
"Yes, but Modi implied that difference between the market price and subsidized price is as high as Rs 300, and that his government is paying the difference for the benefit of the middle class. That's not true at all because the difference is much smaller. Any other government would have done the same thing."
'Look at the graphs man! The prices have been coming down since 2010 due to technological improvements and increased demands worldwide.'
"Yes, LED bulbs are being adopted worldwide because they're so far ahead in terms of both ease of manufacturing and efficient use of power. They became very cheap over the past five years because many countries adopted them at the same time and the technology improved.\n\nEDIT: \n\n> I bought 3 last year in July.

'I feel it is somewhat Cause and effect. People praised him so much, the other side had to adjust to keep up.'
'Economies of scale leads to fall in prices, fall in prices leads to increase in demand. Add lower power consumption and comparatively brighter than cfl. The GoI was the reason of demand and also supply(was through big tenders).\n\nAgar simple price determination supply demand ke through aise nahi hota to kaise hota he?\n\n'
"OP i mean no offence but your research is half cooked. Don't criticise just for the sake of it. One cannot deny that current GoI has given a big push for adaption of LED lights just as previous govt. did for CFL bulbs. In 2013 market price was above 300 and very few were interested to buy these bulbs. You can have a look at CFL bulbs sales figure.Once EESL started their operation, the cost came down heavily. You're quoting US figure. What works in US may not work in India. \n\ntechnological advances doesn't mean India can adapt as quickly as western countries can. Look as our 3G or 4G speed, Electric cars etc. Sometimes you need a Govt. push to speed things up. So Give EESL and GoI the credit where it is due."
'You should go through the speech once again\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JBSfp8c\n\nThe slide clearly mentions "Impact of Economy of scale".\n\n> Modi implied that difference between the market price and subsidized price is as high as Rs 300, and that his government is paying the difference for the benefit of the middle class.\n\nYou have to be somewhat dumb to take the implication that the government is paying the difference. He said efforts of government through UJALA scheme brought down the prices. He also said I don\'t know why it was 350/- at that time. He never even hints that we are subsidizing the difference.\n\nHow did UJALA scheme help economy of scale? First of all, it made government\'s intention clear that it is going to incentivize LEDs so investors knew that their large investments won\'t go in vain. Main issue with LED bulbs was that there was high initial costs, so government decided to spread the cost across many months and not burden the consumer. The government itself bought large quantities of bulbs at low rates bringing in assured demand and forcing the hand of competitors.\n\nThe report you linked itself mentions "local and state incentives" helping the cause in US. So similar incentives in India of course helped with that.\n\nhttp://www.ujala.gov.in/'
"In our state, Philips LED bulbs were distributed. They are working fine, didn't have a problem with even one of them, its been 1.5 years iirc. \n\nYou can get them changed if you have the receipt or the electricity bill which reflects the purchase. "
'This is true and happening alot. Due to large volume lot of companies were given part of tender. Not all have given good quality. But they do come with warranty.'
'So you want to put a graph from EIA USA here and want to say it went down by itself in India?\n\nNow look at the graph itself, for same energy efficiency the LED price is almost 4 times higher, that too in US where imports are quite cheaper. In India, major companies make CFL but LEDs were quite costly during 2014.\n\nIt was the scheme that gave manufacturers confidence that there will be huge demand, otherwise no poor or middle class would have bought it and in India importing technology for wide scale distribution takes a lot of time and money.\n\nStill CFL are popular in India as LED give quite low light compared to CFL.'
"Can't find fault in logic, let's find fault in grammar "
'I think govt had some part to play in it they helped accelerate the reduction of cost of LEDs\n'
"You can look at global prices of LEDs to see that it has been technology and global manufacturing scale. Modi's programme probably helped local prices catch up a bit, perhaps - like how EV batteries are a bit more expensive in India than in other markets because a competitive local (import) market hasn't been established yet"

I can guess no one is subsidizing them as to just being worth 70rs, in the bulk govt is buying them.'

"I don't know about any official channels for reporting this. But, I'd suggest tweeting about it as a way to get a dialogue started. Better still would be to tweet to an official immigration handle, airport handle or a ministers handle. Sushma Swaraj in particular reaches out pretty fast."
"I've been out of the country twice, and every time I get asked more questions while getting out of India than while entering Germany. Last time it was about what I study and how I got the research collaboration and how did my college allow me to go during the semester, all with a look of suspicion/rudeness, with the immigration guy asking me my invite letter (in German) and looking through it multiple times. The German border agency didn't ask me for it."
'Pro tip to deal with Indian government office cunts:\n\nConfidence. They are all pussies on the inside.\n\nIn this case, all you need to do is, either to that guy or some other security guy near by, after you are done with your work, go and say "What is that immigration guy\'s name" just ask in a cool boss tone. They will ask why. You say something along the lines of "why is he yelling at her? I have it on video. One phone call to my uncle and he will be out of that job in 2 days. Thats why I want his name" It is important to look like a boss during all this. 99/100 times they will start shitting bricks. They will say something like "let it go sir, I will tell him" and start pleading with you. Confidence is key, look important :P\n\n\nThe number of times I have used this, it has worked always. Also, Indians are super afraid of people who standup in public. Most people have public speaking fear or fear of society. I was at a canteen in an Apollo hospital, they were supposed to start lunch at 12pm, it was 1.15 and still they were setting it up (This was the canteen for people who accompany patients) And the guy setting up the lunch buffet was super super slow, chit chatting around etc\n\nI fucking lost my cool after waiting for 30 mins for food. Also I was in a bad mood because my mom was going to under go a pretty big surgery in an hour. I stood up and started loudly asking manager why the food was not ready. There were around 30 people waiting and no one was saying anything. AI turned to everyone "Look at these guys, we are all waiting and how slow he is" pointing to the guy who was dragging his ass on the job. I started openly picking on one lazy cunt, he got super nervous and conscious because now I was yelling at him infront of 30 people and all of them were agreeing with me. He just finished and went inside. All it took was one guy to stand up and say "why is this guy so slow, there are so many of us waiting" \n\nIndians are good with herd mentality, as soon as you pick on one particular person, they shit bricks and everyone with him try to escape throwing him under the bus.'
'Jeez man. Nothing ruins a trip into a foreign land like being scolded right at the entry point. I honestly feel bad for her.\n\nI have only gone through Indian immigration once, and the guy wasn\'t rude, but the people were extremely inefficient. They were sitting and chatting with each other while people were waiting in line. \n\nSimilarly, I have only gone through US immigration once, and they were kinda funny. The people were talking about Indian Jones and Shiva/Kali. Asked me if I knew the meaning of \'Omnom Shiva [sic]\'. I said no. He was like, Okay. Then he looked at my passport and was like, "You\'re from India and you don\'t know? Get outta here!" He was very friendly, and just like that, I crossed immigration and walked out the airport.\n\nOff topic: CBP handles immigration in the US, not the TSA, right? Also, wha form did you have to fill. I have only gone through Indian immigration once (in DEL), but I didn\'t have to fill out any form, is it something specific to BOM, or are you not an Indian citizen or something?'
'I wonder, why on earth do we have those forms anymore? They made sense in the pre-computer era when immigration needed records of people entering and leaving the country, but with computers and machine readable passports, I think your data gets saved in the central server'
'That is just one of the things to get mad at. There are a billion Indians. Even if 1% are bad, that number is still huge to get mad at. My suggestion right now is to take it easy and do our good job of helping others. Even if no-body notices or cares, do not go give up.'
'I recall my first trip to US in 2002. December snowstorm, threw up in flight.\n\nWas last to exit flight. Immigration officer asks me "Why are you so late and what is your purpose?" \n\nMy response "I just threw up in the flight, and i feel i want to throw up again. Here\'s my passport."\n\nNever have i had a faster, smoother entry :)\n\nMy wife and kid entered Netherlands on their dependent visas.

'Good on you for going out of your way to help her out!'
">At Dulles, they even have a big board up in the lines leading up to the immigration hall which state that their goal is for their staff to be the first friendly face you see when you make it to the US\n\nHaven't faced the US customs at any US airports, but the US customs officer at Toronto airport or at Niagra/Sarnia border are not the most friendly people.

"Other countries treat their international airports as part of the tourist experience. International airports like those in Dubai, Singapore, Minnesota, etc. are not just places to catch a flight. They have shopping malls, bars, restaurants, meeting spaces, movie theaters, etc. \n\nI recently flew through Abu dhabi airport. They have a cool service for people waiting for their connecting flights. If your connecting flight is over 4 hours long, they have special bus tours that take you for a quick trip around town to show you a couple of highlights, and get you back in time for your flight. I didn't take the tour, but it is the kind of level of detail they go to try and get tourist dollars. "

'I had to apply for a PCC from the PSK at Bangalore for something similar (part of the procedures for Canadian immigration) and had a similar experience, except it was one tiny old lady working at the office who didn\'t stop me but she patted me on the shoulder and said "I\'m sure your parents are very proud of you and good luck with your dreams, but do not forget us and the place where you came from."\n\nIt was the weird, oddly sweet aunty-brand of misplaced good intentions. '
'I think its mainly to do with Indians not caring about anything outside their bubble. For example, they\'ll keep their houses really clean but not keep their neighbourhood or workplace clean. \n\nSomething logical such as "more tourists in India, more chances of keeping job, getting better salary since govt will have more revenue so must make them happy here" doesn\'t register with the Indian mindset. \n\nThe immigration officer is only concerned about finishing up ASAP so that he can take a break until the next flight. Such short-termism is the bane of our country\'s culture. '
"That is what they're supposed to be doing lol. Doesn't matter how sleepy/tired you are, you still have to go through all the procedures. "

When I first flew in around 2005, the lady officer told me she loved Indian food and asked me what my favorite dish was so she could try it.

'Surprisingly, even Washington Dulles had a paper-based form thing last year, but when I landed at JFK last week, they had one of those scanning machine thingies which were actually quite nice to use. \n\nI still had some human intervention (The automated machines print out a small slip of paper that you need to present to an immigration officer) who wished me good morning, asked me two questions and said "Welcome to the US, enjoy your stay!" and sent me off on my way. No fuss. By far, the easiest immigration I had in the US and kinda sways my decision to fly by JFK all the time if I could. '
'A few friends of mine went through Pearson and didn\'t have a similar problem, but I imagine that since it\'s the most popular port of call for immigrants making their first landing (as I might at some point in the future), it is duly noted. \n\nNever flew through Gatwick, always went through Heathrow, but I had one funny incident where the guy gave me a thumbs up when I removed my \'stache (accident while shaving meant I needed to \'86 the whole thing).

"First Reddy and now this. I think there's a secret Biggest Wedding Wins competition in the BJP. "
"**50 chartered planes to ferry VVIPs to Nagpur for Gadkari’s daughter’s wedding**\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/12/04/Pictures/gurgaon-minister-gurgaon-gadkari-foundation-ceremony-junctions_f14836dc-b9c5-11e6-90a3-d2b8563aec4d.jpg)\n\n___\n\nOver 10,000 guests, most of them VVIPs like Union home minister Rajnath Singh, BJP president Amit Shah, industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Ratan Tata, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Union ministers and chief ministers, will be flown to the city in 50 charter flights on Sunday evening. The reason — the wedding of Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s daughter.\n\nThe VVIP guests’ list also include former deputy prime minister LK Advani and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray.\n\nBelieve it or not, air tickets from any place to Nagpur on December 3 and 4 are not available.\n\nAmong the other VVIP guests are Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, filmstars Hema Malini and Amitabh Bachchan, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla.\n\nThe wedding will be solemnised at Rani Kothi on Wardha Road in Nagpur. A similar gathering of VVIPs was witnessed in Nagpur when Gadkari’s eldest son, Nikhil, married Rutuja in December 2010, when Gadkari was the BJP president.

"http://www.india.com/news/india/nitin-gadkaris-office-denies-booking-50-charter-flights-for-vips-to-attend-daughters-weding-1690186/\n\nIssued a denial. Everyone's panties still in a bunch? 10 flights max. Also, the mahurat for the wedding was this morning, why (according to the article!) is everyone reaching this evening?"
"In 2010 also his son's wedding had 50 chartered planes. Why? Because big shots come in chartered planes. Like I'm sure people like Mukesh Ambani would come in a chartered plane and not in normal domestic flight, but they'll proably be also coming in their own planes. They, asking Mr. Gadkari a few lakhs for flights won't make any sense. I don't see how is this a big issue? "
'Yeah he is rich.Deal with it.He was an industrialist I suppose . '
'> Among the other VVIP guests are Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, filmstars Hema Malini and Amitabh Bachchan, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla.\n\nWhy no love for Sonia Gandhi and kejriwal?!

'Yes. Like Sharad Pawarji.'
"Nope. Smells like it is from the fake news department. Apparently the wedding is low-key family-only affair, followed by a grand reception on 8th in Delhi.\n\nBesides, the report is dated December 4th, of course there won't be tickets available for 3rd December."
"but i am also pretty sure gadkari wouldn't want to do that. those who have lavish weddings serve two purposes - to demonstrate their 'status' and to offload illicitly earned money."

It was better but no longer was I able to watch more than an episode.\n\nWhen adults say that today\'s cartoon are shit and yesterdays\' cartoons were so awesome then they often don\'t take into consideration that they have already judged old cartoons like Tom N Jerry and Powderpuff girls to be good when they were children. However, they are judging new cartoons, like Oggy and the Cockroaches, when they are adults and not as a children. '

The aadhar authority (UIDAI) itself can link your phone number (as a foreign/reference key) to that primary key.\n\nFurther, other agencies like banks, IT dept, gas agencies, etc. can also link your details in their database (bank a/c number, PAN no., gas connection no., etc.) to your primary key (aadhar).\n\nSimilarly, the ISP (Idea/Vodafone) is also like one of these agencies. Since phone-number is your detail in their database, again, they can (in fact, will) link your phone number to your primary key (aadhar).\n\nNow, what happens, when every number relating to each one of us is ultimately linked to aadhar? Anyone having a high contact in UIDAI can do a single select query and find out everything about you just by using your aadhar number in the where clause - your biometric details, phone numbers, bank accounts, etc. As long as this facility is used for good, there are no problems, but the danger is that it might very well result in an Orwellian society in future that seeks to control and silence the free voice and whistle-blowers among us, hence aadhar is a very controversial topic since long.\n\nRichard Stallman calls National ID programs like these a "Stalin\'s Dream". That\'s because the above scenario results in an immense amount of power in one single hand - we already give out a lot of information like our bank details, PAN, etc., but until now, all this information was with different agencies. But once one central agency or person has this kind of power, it may not turn out to be very good for us. That\'s because *power corrupts*.'
'Thanks for explaining.\n\n>the danger is that it might very well result in an Orwellian society in future that seeks to control and silence the free voice among us\n\nWith these many linkages, cross-linkages of Aadhar and going by the rate with which citizens are happily giving up their rights in the name of patriotism & whatnot , it seems inevitable. '

But they are part of the development of a country’s spirit; they express the refining of a nation’s sensibility; they add to the common, growing stock.\xa0In India these endless mosques and rhetorical mausolea, these great palaces speak only of a personal plunder and for a country with an infinite capacity for being plundered.\xa0The Mogul owned everything in his dominions; and this is the message of the Mogul architecture. I know only one building in England with this quality of dead-end personal extravagance…the Blenheim. Imagine England as a country of Blenheims, continually built, destroyed and rebuilt over five hundred years, each a gift of the nation and seldom for services rendered…leaving at the end no vigorous nation…no principle beyond that of personal despotism. The\xa0Taj Mahal is exquisite…But in India it is a building wastefully without function; it is only a despot’s monument to a woman, not of India, who bore a child every year for fifteen years. It took twenty-two years to build; and the guide will tell you how many millions it cost...*\n\n'

May be emi gives you saving discipline, also I think the bigger point may be, booming housing prices of early 2000 made sense to buy house on loan. As you could always assume that the prices will far runaway from the amount you would be paying as interest. \n\nI think easy credit is one of the reason housing prices had a upward surge. \n\nAgain, I myself is not clear about the ramification of saving vs. debt based economy. This is more of a observation. \n\nPersonally I find shackled feeling with debt. Try to stay away from it. '
'Hah, groan someone gets it. If you manage to save a good amount for the down deposit, then the emi becomes reasonable. How much were you saving on auto/taxi costs...'
'😂 you mean upper upper middle class? \n\nActually it depends on how long you have been upper middle class. If someone is newly there, they would want to save for larger major expenses like buying a house. '
"\n>I think easy credit is one of the reason housing prices had a upward surge. \n\nI think I could agree with you on this. \n\nI've just started earning and yes, buying a house is usually one of the first major goals most of us have. So I've been thinking about it. But the very thought of having to commit to paying a loan for the next 20-30 years makes me uneasy. Additionally, the Mumbai housing market is so inflated right now, most of the salaried class cannot afford it, can't imagine how the prices remain so high. It doesn't make me feel confident enough to invest in one. So I agree with you there. If I had to invest in a home I would probably do it in Pune or Bangalore or something after doing adequate research. \n\nBut my point stands, if I so not buy a home now on loan, I would be paying rent instead. Might as well have a house to my name with EMIs instead. And yes the generation of the 80's and 90's had access to affordable homes in a manner we don't. \n\n"
'Too much headache. I considered that option before buying my car. Have to find a trusted mechanic and seller. Have to do a background check on the car etc etc. Just decided buying a new one was worth it.'
'Maybe you can try the used car dealers like Maruti TruValue (dunno if thats what its called.)'
"> That's dumb.\n\nthe argument above isn't exactly wrong. if you're paying EMIs for a car that is not a ferrari (honestly because that would hold its value well), you really should be buying a used car."
'By your logic a bank would not be in business ever. You cannot assume the rate of loan is better than your rate of investment returns.'
"Newer ferrari don't hold their values as well. I agree that used cars at the better initial value proposition. However new car will have not been driven by anyone and it will have a warranty. "
"don't know about india's loan rates but here in US, my car loan's interest rate is below 2% and and I can easily get at least 8-10% on my investment. So my logic is correct that I should get the car loan and invest the rest of the cost of buying my car into the market."

'> Have you read who spent the 7000 crores?\n\n\nThe spending was managed NMCG (National Mission to Clean Ganga), which comes under a very *specialised* ministry called:\n\n> Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & **Ganga Rejuvenation**\n\nI mean, the ministry itself has that in its name. And it is headed by the very able and talented Ms. Uma Bharti. \n\nYou are trying to blame the analysts, and sure they should be blamed, but was the project manager sleeping? '
'Were the congis entrusted to clean up the ganga? did the funds go through italian bar maids account?'
"It's all in the national party's interest. \n\n\nFTFY"
'Just like those chips in the new notes that track them?'
"Wow i never knew Ganges has dolphins. Are they any other marine life i don't know of?."
'> So the blame is on all 3 right? The allocation is done by the Ganga rejuvenation ministry but the implementation is done by the states.\n\nYes, but it is natural to blame the project manager more than the coders working under him? The project is headed by NMCG whose core objective is to monitor this project and dispense/manage the funds. \n\nSo if I understand correctly now, your only objection is that why are people only blaming the BJP for mismanagement, when UP government also mismanaged? Sure, other state governments are to be blamed as well. \n\nBut the buck will stop at whoever was heading the project. Does Central government ~~has~~ have* some special love and trust equation that they will allocate 20,000 Cr. without any oversight? This is a perfect example of gross mismanagement and negligence at best and corruption at worst. '
"> The article says Center and state but if you read the judgment you will learn that 7000 crores was given to states. The Centers role is to give the money to the states which they have.\n\nNo. There is one agency overseeing and managing the whole project. From the judgement itself:\n\n> The NMCG is the Nodal Agency for overseeing the execution of the project and to provide requisite funds for completion of the projects in appropriate, effective and expeditious manner.\n\n[NMCG](http://nmcg.nic.in/) = National Mission to Clean Ganga. They are the ones supposed to be managing the project. Who runs it?\n\n> The Director General(DG) of NMCG is a Additional Secretary in Government of India.\n\nWhat are their powers?\n\n> Executive Committee has been authorized to accord approval for all projects up to **Rs.1000 crore.**\n\nThat's a big chunk of money. I wonder which minister oversees this body:\n\n> **Uma Bharti**, Ministry of Water Resources,River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation\n\nThat explains the competence I guess. "

Special programmes will be held to educate the school children about the greatness of the leaders.Announcing this at a programme to mark the 126th birth anniversary of Baba Sahab Bhim Rao Ambedkar here on Friday, chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath said, "it is not a great idea to close the schools on the occasion of birth or death anniversaries of great people. In fact, many times, children don\'t even know why the school has been closed. This defeats the purpose of commemorating a holiday on the occasion."The CM further said that children must be given a chance to take inspiration from the great leaders. "To ensure that children take inspiration from the great leaders, special programmes should be organised on the occasion," Yogi said. Citing the example of Ambedkar, he added, "the struggle and journey of Baba Sahab Ambedkar is a story that has inspired many generations and will continue to do the same in future as well."Yogi also said that closure of schools on various occasions was not in the interest of children and their future. "Rule books say that schools should have 220 working days but the target is rarely achieved because of too many holidays. This leaves the teachers with about 130-140 working days which is not enough for students to learn," he said.Taking opportunity to talk about his government, Aditya Nath said, "I want to reiterate that the BJP government is not prejudiced towards any caste or religion. In fact, we are committed to mainstream sections of society that have been left behind in the race for development." Yogi also said that any kind of discrimination and untouchability will not be allowed under his rule.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

When it comes to jugaad, we like keeping it simple and avoid processes and formalities which can be a great advantage some times. But at other times, instead of keeping it simple, we just bloat and over-engineer the whole thing, just as in this example. We won't be entertained just by witty comedies or cool actions or great dialogues, but we want that to last for a long time, which doesn't happen unfortunately in practice. In fact, if you start watching shorter movies, the pressure will be on them to entertain you to the max in that short span which will result in a much better movie overall than otherwise."

"Good luck, man. Just make sure you make a list of all the things you need and buy it before going to Manali. Don't forget ropes, and good gloves. I can not emphasize on the importance of gloves enough. I had bought fuckin shitty ass gloves that had holes in them by 3rd day. Wet hands in negative temperature on a bike with cold bitter wind cutting through on top of a mountain is not the most pleasing feeling. But you will be surrounded by almost unparalleled beauty. Don't forget to wave at fellow bikers going the other way. "
'Thanks for the advice. When you say ropes, do you mean to tie up my bag, like bungy. Or a real actual rope?'
'I meant bungee. Because my friend and I wanted to do it in least costly way possible, we used actual ropes to tie the bags and we also used polythene to cover the bags instead of using actual waterproof bag cover. It kind of made more memorable with all those struggles keeping them bags straight. '
"Ok cool. Yeah I just ordered a waterproof cover online. Was like 10usd. I'll look into the gloves as well, I know when I snowmobile my hands can get cold as fuck, but we sometimes have heated handlebars ;)"

It  does  not  account  for  a  country’s proximity to large markets, the quality of its infrastructure services (other than those related to trading \nacross borders), the security of property from theft and looting,  the  transparency  of  government  procurement,  macroeconomic  conditions  or  the  underlying  strength  of institutions. \n\n>>Still,  a  high  ranking  on  the  ease  of  doing  business  does mean that the government has created a regulatory environment conducive to operating a business. \n\nJust because the report shows improvement, doesn\'t necessarily reflect an individual\'s live is improved.\n\n>This ranking improvement is due to my favorite politician doing something and nothing to do with the effort of the politicians/parties I don\'t like. \n\nThis I agree with, it is both the Centre & the State which has to get the pat on the back, even though we still have to consider the fact that apart from ease of closing business, there has not been significant progress to trumpet about as pointed out by u/randiathrowaway111, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79w22n/india_jumped_from_130_to_100_in_ease_of_doing/dp5c5cu/) and hence we need to be aware that we still have a long long way to go and not like some sensational headlines posted by media outlets likening it to a cricket match of "hitting a ton"\n'

As you can see, the number of procedures to start a business has decreased, the number of days to start a business has decreased and the cost (% of income per capita) has decreased tremendously by 60%!\nIndia, regardless of regime, has improved in "Starting a business" parameter. The drop in rank could easily be due to others outperforming India with regards to this ranking.\n\nRanking #2 - "Dealing with licenses" is NOT the same as "Dealing with construction permits" as the parameters have changed. See how time for permit has decreased significantly but different parameters "build quality control" and "cost (% warehouse value)" so not a valid comparison at all.\n\nRanking #3 - "Registering property" here it seems India has regressed as procedures has increased and so too cost of property value\n\nRanking #4 - "Trading across borders" - again, time to export has decreased significantly (from 18 days to 6 days) and cost to export has decreased by a good 40%+ ($820 to $470). Time to import has decreased significantly (from 21 days to 13.5 days) and cost to import has decreased (from $910 to $680) so, again, and all round improvement from 2008 to 2018.\n\nApart from "Registering property", India has improved SIGNIFICANTLY from 2008 to 2018 in all those parameters. Finer details are far more important than just skimming over the basics. Overall, India has done remarkably well to get to 100th position.

'It should also be noted that getting electricity and registering property [only contributed 0.04% and 0.25% change](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india) in percentage points.

Adityanath is the manifestation of the giant Hindu vote consolidation that has happened in response of tactical voting by the muslim community that has swung elections in their favor in many states, including UP. \n\nAdityanath no doubt is a hardliner hindutva proponent and it would be shameful if he indulges in revenge rather than development. It would also be interesting if he refrains from it and gives UP a real chance to develop. In all of Modi's tenure, this must be the greatest litmus test for him as well as the BJP and RSS regarding their ideology and capability.

"> Aurangazeb must have done some good in his life even if he did impose jaziya? \n\n*Almost all of the Muslim rulers have imposed Jaziya, there were only few exceptions - Akabar/Dar Shikoh. Aurangazeb isn't considered bad because he was just following the Islamic law of taxation, here is a simple example of the kind of things he did - \n\nHere is Wiki Aurangazeb - He learnt that at Sindh, Multan, Thatta and particularly at Varanasi, the Hindu Brahmins attracted large numbers of indigenous local Muslims to their discourses. He ordered the Subahdars of these provinces to **demolish the schools and the temples of non-Muslims**. Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to **punish Muslims who dressed like non-Muslims**. The **executions** of the antinomian Sufi mystic Sarmad Kashani and the ninth Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur bear testimony to Aurangzeb's religious policy; the former was beheaded on multiple accounts of heresy,[b] the latter, according to Sikhs, because he objected to Aurangzeb's forced conversions. \n\n\n*Though jizya was mandated initially for People of the Book (Judaism, Christianity, Sabianism), it was extended by Islamic jurists to all non-Muslims.[126][127] Thus Muslim rulers in India, with the exception of Akbar, collected jizya from Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs under their rule."

Or that only the Muslims vote? If so that is the greatest victory against all odds especially considering they are a minority in just about every constituency in the State.\n  \nThe fact of the matter is that UP elections have often hinged on caste issues. This time the BJP managed to unify the Hindu vote by employing similar rhetoric to those who seek to consolidate the Muslim or Dalit votes. If Muslims were so critical to how elections are decided in UP surely BJP should have suffered for failing to field a single Muslim candidate."

"Sikhism should be a religion favored by the RSS by that measure. You are making up a partial argument that does not stand analysis. That is, the motivations of the RSS cannot be as you described because otherwise by that measure they would be radical Sikhists as well. They are not. The RSS is just another generic religious extremist organization like any Muslim one, and is a stain on India. Sui generis shat on and flushed. Moving on.\n\nTamil is favored in Tamil Nadu because language is of a different nature to religion and is practical/functional. Unlike religious or political identity, it cannot be arbitrarily changed on a whim and it requires exerted effort to adapt to a new language. \n\nThere is no more reason to favor a religious ideology because of its national origins than there is to favor a political ideology because of its national origins. Why is the RSS not radically opposed to constitutional parliamentary democracy? India's inherent political structure is not federal but a bunch of warring antagonistic disunited kingdoms and the occasional empire. \n\nYour argument is not substantive and collapses. There is no particular reason that origin should give weight. India is a secular democratic republic with a structure that is wholly borrowed from abroad. The ideas of the RSS and religious nationalists are anti-Indian by the very definition of modern India. \n\nIf all religions were equally good/bad, what explains the creation and continued existence of India as an impoverished Hindu nationalist state? If this was really a concern of yours, you would be seeking out Christianity, as on average Christian societies are far and away the wealthiest and most successful as of yet."

The most drastic I've heard is that they're misguided Indians that need to return to their Dharmic roots or must have population controlled. Afaik, the Muslim=Arab/Turk/Persian thing is prevalent with some Paks not Indians. \n\n>The future i see where AAP MIM and BJP will be the only survivors\n\nI doubt AAP will be popular anywhere outside of big, more progressive, metros.

This is especially dangerous because they all seem to vote for one party only in a given election.\n\nTo win against such party, only a tatic of sizeable hindus voting for them can save their ass.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that even BSP's vote base of dalits voted heavily for BJP. This apparently was due to dalits voting against 100+ muslim nominees of BSP."

But we've always been a level-headed people, embracing religion when it aided social upliftment, yet crushing religion when it obstructed progress, always keeping ideals like education and advancement above all.

The only reason AIB has soo much of followers is because some people think it is cool to follow them, not because they are funny or anything.

'On the other side, if all the money is honestly spent at least people will get money as part of employment. '
"This whole jumla is done to appease the Marathas in MH. Often proponents of this give an excuse that this will bring revenue through tourism. (Just like Mayawati said before constructing that monument in Noida that not a soul visits.)\n\nIndia is in dire threat to appeasement politics. It should be noted that in democracy, particularly in India, Politicians and the Government's main objective is to either get elected or to get re-elected. Any public development policies are purely incidental and of secondary nature.\n\nBJP thinks that it will get elected in Maha, therefore appeasement politics to attract Maratha voters have started.\n\nIf you truly want revenue from monuments, why not develop monuments which shivaji himself has built? The hill forts around western ghats, naval forts, Buildings in pune. Why don't they attract foreign tourists to those monuments by developing a good tourist plans. Not only the locals around those forts will earn from the money from tourists, but also people will be informed more of Shivaji and his legacy.\n\nI voted for Modi in 2014, it was the very first vote I cast in my life, I voted him because he promised development, I didn't care about Hindu Nationalism, I wanted the promised development and the 'good governance' that the party projected in their Manifesto.\n\nNot only this they are giving reservations to Marathas, now it will total 71% in MH. 71%. Imagine that. Ambedkar must be ashamed of the disgusting vote-bank, caste, religion appeasement politics that today's politicians are doing.\n\nSpeaking of reservations, if you look at the chapter of schedule caste and schedule tribes in the constitution, you will find it talks of reservations only in context of, and I am using constitutional language here, 'proportional to the percentage population in state legislative assemblies.' This means that it talks nothing about reservation in education and govt jobs. Ultimately, one has to decide how much erosion of competency in our education and bureaucracy we can afford."
'one of the reason is to  appease maratha people from MH, they just had one of the biggest morcha.\nInstead of new statue they can refurbish and repair forts of shivaji that will be enough  '
"Half a billion seems awfully expensive for a statue with a museum and aquarium. To put this into perspective, China recently build the world's highest bridge for about 100 million. \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3785064/Would-dare-drive-China-completes-world-s-highest-bridge-built-1-850-feet-ground.html\n\nAt least a bridge will improve transportation. What the heck will a statue do? Tourism? How many tourists will go see the statue? \n\n\n"
'Why are we building a statue of Shivaji? I am sure that there are many better candidates -  Vikram Sarabhai, Homi Bhabha ...'
"If this was done for Gandhi Id accept. Shivaji hasn't done anything that incredible"
"Although the amount $500 million is very high the idea of building a landmark statue is not wrong.\nThe argument of how many hospitals we may be able to build is the same given when funding to ISRO projects is debated.\nWhy is it different this time? I'm genuinely trying to understand.\nSo if the monument is truly world-class and may help in bringing tourists and provide employment then why the hell not?\n"
"$500 millions for a regional hero.\n\nshivaji didn't anything for everyone, he is a pride or marathas and we are spending millions of of dollar for only a specific group of people.\n\n$500 millions will become $1 billion over the year(budget overrun).\n$500 millions can be converted to $5 billions if invested properly.\n"

">So if the monument is truly world-class and may help in bringing tourists and provide employment then why the hell not?\n\nIf you are talking about domestic tourists, then sure there is 50/50 chance. But they aren't going to bring in $500 million worth of business. I highly doubt anyone outside of India knows/cares about shivaji. \n\nMy (TN) government did the same thing with the thiruvalluvar statue, although it didn't cost $500 millions. And no, it did not increase the tourists numbers at all. \n\nPeople care about historical statues/forts/walls and not their modern counterpart."

"The irony here is the interviewer preaches professionalism and honesty while recording this on a phone (this is not from the Skype session) and puts this on YouTube as name and shame.

'> my expectation came from watching the examination invigilators back in my school/college days.\n\nThis is so true. I also learned a lot of such bad behaviours and had to unlearn them all. A lot of our elders, probably unbeknownst to them, tried to shame and guilt us and it worked to most extent I guess. They should have known better, but they didn\'t. \n\nOne of the incidents I remember most was when I was in college. Me and another fellow were co-ordinators for a talk in the seminar hall. Once the talk started, we didn\'t have much to do expect wait outside the door for it to end. Then an elder man, perhaps mistaking for a different conference room was trying to open the door. The first reaction in my head was "Hey, who are you and why are you entering there?". I was lucky to witness my friend saying "Excuse me sir, may I help you?". Wow, in that one sentence I understood the bias I had and how one sentence changes the whole interaction. The elder man was obviously lost and he was happily guided in the right direction. That one display of the right behavior was all that I needed to unlearn some bad behavior and I feel good every time I try that line now and often yield smiles.'

"Usually in India biriyani has historically been made with goat meat. Indian beef or pork might work but I just don't see how you'll get the same level of taste.\n\nWhat makes Biriyani good is the animal fat and the marbling of the meat since the cooking process will naturally tend to make everything a bit dry. Chicken Biriyani would be the absolute worst because usually in India it's sold skinless.\n\nWith beef I'm not sure if you'd be able to find good cuts that would have enough fat for Biriyani - if you could it should work great. Otherwise goat/sheep.\n\nWith Pork the taste of the meat is almost entirely in the fat. And pork fat has a very characteristic smell, which is fantastic - but it would create a very unconventional taste. Of course anything cooked in bacon fat for example is glorious so it probably wouldn't taste bad. Just very different.\n\nPork biriyani made with lean pork would be yuck though imo, almost as bad as chicken biriyani.\n\nGenerally Goat meat or lamb (sheep) works best for Biriyani, and those are the authentic recipes."
">but the only good beef is a steak\n\nSteak is only good if the beef is good.\n\nThe problem is that beef in India is of shit tier quality. Top-notch beef will always taste amazing generally no matter what if you get good cuts. The problem is you just won't get this sort of thing in India outside of a few 5-stars or a handful of chains and restaurants that will import it for you. For the most part you will be better served with Buffalo meat, since the quality tends to be more consistent.\n\nCows in India are not really selectively bred for good meat, heck they aren't even bred for good milk. Most Indians boil their milk before drinking anyway so even the taste becomes irrelevant at that point. It's a poor country so finer things like tasty food and drink are alien concepts for most of the country.\n\nNothing can really match dry aged rib eye steak.\n\nThe good thing about Pork is it's an extremely hardy animal, it requires very little upkeep or care and the quality is very consistent. So you can't really ever go wrong with Pork even in India. Bacon is good in India, ham is alright. Sausages are rubbish though.\n\n>White meat is still the most versatile for Indian cuisine - even red meats like pork and mutton aren't that great\n\nEh \n\nGoat meat is an essential ingredient in Biriyani, many kinds of kebabs, Raan. These were delicacies that became popular in the nawab era. It's a fixture in Mughlai cuisine.\n\nPork is excellent in Goan cuisine, and some North East dishes.\n\n>but beef is just meh.\n\nIt depends on the quality of the beef. You generally only get cheap cuts from what are basically discarded milch animals unless you are importing the meat."

'The main conflict between Gandhi and Ambedkar, and there is no pussyfooting around it, centered on the idea of Hinduism.  \n\nGandhiji had a firm belief that Hinduism could be cleaned of its social evils and regressive customs and the Dalit upliftment could be done within the Hindu fold itself.Using his immense popularity and acceptance amongst almost all Indians, he tried to rally upper caste Hindus behind this plank. This is also part of the reason why he called Dalits *Harijans* (children of Hari/God) so as to ensure their linkage with Hinduism.  \n  \nAmbedkar, the man who once described Caste as a "multi-storeyed tower with no staircase" believed that Caste was a "feature" of Hinduism that could not be separated from it and that the ultimate defeat of caste would not be possible within Hinduism. He exhorted the Dalit community to come out of the Hindu fold (like he himself did, studied all religions and disliked most, [memorably criticized Islam](https://www.newslaundry.com/2017/04/14/ambedkar-on-islam-the-story-that-must-not-be-told) before  ultimately converting to Buddhism) and had nothing but derision for Hinduism (with arguably good reason)   \n  \nThis difference of opinion between them is kinda similar to the MLK vs Malcolm X debate on the emancipation of African Americans where MLK (like Gandhi) believed that black rights could be guaranteed within the framework of America whereas Malcolm X (like Ambedkar) often advocated for black separatism for most of his life and got assassinated just when he had begun softening his position. \n  \nUltimately **both** Gandhi and Ambedkar were proved wrong. Hinduism has, as of now not yet let go of caste completely proving that Gandhiji was being too optimistic. On the other hand, converting to other religions has not helped Dalits throw off the yoke of oppression. Sometimes, they face [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_among_Indian_Christians) in their new religions as well.'
'Those who claim this as a TIL today, need a lotta TILs! Like for instance from "what was the reason behind their difference of opinion" to "how it shaped India".\n\nHowever, I\'d like to clarify that this above statement is not in vain contempt but only to assuade those to get a  real understanding of the fabric holding India together!\n\nHaving said that, Ambedkar & Gandhi\'s disdain is a well known one, and it pertains to the matter of \'caste\' his idea of social justice and his two-decade long debate with Gandhi.\n\n[This article expands on it and gives a very clear picture.](https://thewire.in/29301/revisiting-ambedkar-gandhi-indias-unfinished-war/)\n\nAs the author writes eloquently:\n\nTo ensure the promise of India is accorded to all her people, it is imperative to pay heed to **Gandhi’s insistence on a socio-political revolution to affect an organic transformation in India’s social consciousness** *and to* **Ambedkar’s faith in the State as a means to guarantee not only equality of opportunity but also of outcome.**\n\n\n[This is another excellent article that addresses the issue](http://www.frontline.in/books/ambedkar-and-gandhi/article6180114.ece)\n\n\nHowever, for some the TIL may seem to portray that, albeit in a skewed way, the Sangh did what was needed - nothing could be farther from the truth, because it was Gandhi who was against the very thing the Sangh was trying to promote, casteism as sacrosanct to Hinduism (drawing inspiration from regressive scriptures like the Manusmriti - which even Ambedkar vociferously decried), for which he was assassinated.\n\nOn September 12 1947, Gandhi told his prayer meeting that he lad been told that the hands of RSS were steeped in blood. Gowalkar assured him that this was untrue. It stood for peace and he had asked Gandhiji to make his “Golwalkar views public”‘. Gandhi, obviously, was not assured, for he told the All India Congress Committee (AICC) two months later, on November 15: ‘I have heard it said that Sangh is at the root of all this mischief . . . Hinduism cannot be saved by orgies of murder’.\n\nThe next day, November 16, he spoke of ‘the Hindu Mahasabha assisted by members of the RSS who wish that all Muslims should be driven away from the Indian Union’. He had received complaints about their behaviour in Rajkot also. `Is it true that they have harassed the Muslims? If not, who has?’.\n\nGandhi went on a fast from January 13. The RSS was among the signatories to the declaration embodying assurances to Muslims that persuaded Gandhi to break his fast on January 18. Still, Gandhi was none too assured. \n\nPyarelal, Gandhi\'s devoted \'Boswell\' and privy to his confidence, records: \'A member of Gandhiji’s party interjected that the RSS people had done a fine job of work at Wah refugee camp. They had shown discipline, courage and capacity for hard work. “But don’t forget,” answered Gandhiji,” even so had Hitler’s Nazis and the Fascists under Mussolini.”‘\n\nOn January 20, two days after Gandhi broke his fast, one Madanlal Pahwa threw a bomb which exploded some 20 metres away from where Gandhi was sitting.\n\nTen days later, that conspiracy accomplished its objective. Gandhi was assassinated.\n'
'He talks about his relationship with Gandhi in this BBC interview from 1955. Quite an interesting interview too.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJs-BJoSzbo'
"Well, I kind of agree with most of the well informed comments here, back in early 2010s I was surprised to see this play by Arvind Gaur's group 'Ambedkar vs Gandhi' which highlighted some of these aspects from Ambedkar's PoV. \n\nBut I'd also like to understand what was Gandhi's take on Ambedkar? I am guessing he was probably supportive of Ambedkar and his capabilities else with his clout (at the time) and Nehru at helm of affairs, Ambedkar might not have got the opportunities that he got (inc. wiring the constitution and penning down the reservation stuff) or it was that Gandhi had similar feelings for Ambedkar but he was the only suitable guy for those tasks and he couldn't have done anything about it?"
'Please link the whole article and not just clipping. Taking something out of context will create lots of unwanted trouble.'
'A friend pointed out to me once that Godse and Ambedkar were pretty close or something to that effect. It seemed others including Nehru and Patel later on even sidelined Ambedkar totally as they felt he sympathized with Godse.\n\nNo sources to prove anything, above stuff just might be heresy. '
"You missed a lot of details, without which we cant paint the complete picture and the conclusion looks out of line.\n\n>The main conflict between Gandhi and Ambedkar, and there is no pussyfooting around it, centered on the idea of Hinduism.\n\nThe main conflict was **not Hinduism**.\n\nThe main conflict was regarding emancipication, and this is the context for their views on Hinduism.\n\nFor Gandhi, emancipation of the dalits was possible within the caste system. He believed the varna system to be an essential feature of Hindusim, but not as a discriminatory one. Thus, he gave them a new name, and urged everyone to help in their upliftment.\n\nFurther, the emancipation was to be done culturally, by dalits adopting cleanliness, and upper castes giving them respect etc. Gandhi believed that humans had the capability to be selfless. This line of through you can see in other Gandhians, like Vinoba Bhave and his Boodan/gramdaam movement, which was a failure.\n\nAmbedkar didnt trust the upper caste, not did he believe that they will suddenly become so welcoming. \nFor him, political and cultural emancipation will automatically happen after after economic emancipation, and thus, his idea of reservation. He believed that if the dalits were equal in status with others economically, rest of the pieces will automatically fall into place.\n\nPersonally, i believe Ambedkar was right. If there was no reservation, dalits will be nowhere to be seen in every day life even now. We can bitch about them getting jobs and easy access now, but for us to bitch about it, itself shows how much progress there has been.\n\nWhile Gandhi's idea of cultural change looks like fool's play. We see the evidence still in the daily news of caste atricoties, the ones which are reported.\n\n"
'This is probably the most well written comment, I have seen in this sub.'
'> Ultimately both Gandhi and Ambedkar were proved wrong. Hinduism has, as of now not yet let go of caste completely proving that Gandhiji was being too optimistic. On the other hand, converting to other religions has not helped Dalits throw off the yoke of oppression.\n\nThat does not prove Ambedkar wrong.'
'**Caste system among Indian Christians**\n\nThe caste system among Indian Christians often reflects stratification by sect, location, and the castes of their predecessors. The caste system today is beyond Hinduism (Hindu society) and it exists in all religions in India.\n\nCaste distinctions among Indian Christians are breaking down at about the same rate as those among Indians belonging to other religions. There exists evidence to show that Christian individuals have mobility within their respective castes.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'

'Which he never hide that fact from the world. He practiced what he preached. If somebody asked him back then "Mr. Gandhi , is it true that you fed goat milk to your dying wife?"

He gave people freedom to judge him as well, not just freedom from the British rule. Even for idiots like you to disagree, disrespect and make fun about his doings.He said it all.'

"To be fair, If you read his biography, You'd feel that he himself felt so much guilty about that.\n\nIt was also the fact that his dad was already on death bed and instead of being with him he chose to be with his wife, which for a normal person might not be such a big deal for long time. Maybe we all feel guilty but then eventually come to peace with it.\n\nBut I think (completely my own thinking) that most of his life he never came to peace with that fact and he acted out by following celibacy."
'More like 1%.'
"Gandhi took quinine which was an existing and known remedy and he was in the early stages of whatever he had. Kasturba was on her deathbed and penicillin wasn't magically going to save her. The whole western vs indian medicine has nothing to do with the situation."
'It\'s not a defeat. Thinking of it like that you too are falling prey to the notion that one man can come along and cleanup a thousand year old mess in one lifetime.\n\nI was once driving through a pretty crowded slum with a well educated lady in upper mgmt of an MNC, and we  got stuck in traffic right infront of an Ambedkar statue. She did not know who he was. I was not totally surprised by this as encountering "well-educated" Indians who don\'t know anything about India is a very common occurrence.  But the point is, it made her curious. In that sense, the statue wasn\'t just a symbol of hero worship it was an educational tool. '
'hierarchy is common in other caste also. In fact it is everywhere in one way or anther. Like IIT vs other eng students. '
"Ambedkar's writings on this topic are depressing. He writes that he expected at least the Parsis would not practice untouchability but shockingly even they threw him out of their hotel after they found out he was a Dalit. The prevalence of untouchability in Christianity, Sikhism, and Islam is why Ambedkar chose Buddhism, a blank slate because at the time there were only a few thousand Buddhists in all of India. \n\nInterestingly enough, another reason is his meeting with a far-right Hindu leader who urged him to stick to a Dharmic faith if he was going to lead a mass conversion of Dalits. "
'Important additional point -  Hindu groups like Ramakrishna Mission or Aurobindo International cant run private schools with autonomy(student selection, teacher selection, fees, see @realitycheckind work on twitter) ,  (sometimes they try to get out of Hindu tag for this reason), while a Saudi from abroad or an evangelical has freedom to set up schools and run mosques/churches without govt interference.\n\nHindu groups dont work on changing this but do a lot of pointless symbolic politics.'

"You say that Deobandis are not Salafis, and that is true. A quick search reveals that there are many differences between them, but they both support practices such as stoning adulteresses, whipping women, forcing women to wear the burqa etc. The kind of society that results from following such sects is pretty identical. Just check the Taliban's (a Deobandi group) rule in Afghanistan. So from an outsider's perspective it just seems semantics. \n\nYeah the Deobandis follow Hanafi sect and Salafis don't follow any imam but the end result is still the same. You get a society that is extremely intolerant of minorities and other religion and where parents break their daughters teeth for singing film songs."

">The Tabligh Jamaat are not Salafis. They have no relation with Salafis. The author keeps interchanging Tabligh Jamaat and Salafis. You can't be a member/follower of both ideologies.\n\n>Again the footnote on Salafis is riddled with inaccuracies. Jamaat e Islami are again no Salafis. Taliban are Deobandis not Salafis. Al Qaeda and OBL called all Salafi scholars as deviants. Muslims Brotherhood and Salafis also don't like each other and have very different ideologies. Many Salafis were very happy when Morsi was deposed in Egypt.\n\n[This is a very insightful article of Tablighi Jamat (TJ) and its links with Wahabisma nd Salafism.](https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/tablighi_jamaat_indirect_line_terrorism)\n\nThe whole article should be read as it's  pretty nuanced, but for the lazy:\n\n>It is important to understand that TJ is a loosely controlled mass movement rather than a centralized group, as some would maintain. Although TJ operates mosques, it has no fixed membership and Tablighis are free to leave the movement. The mosques are used to support the efforts of the independent jamaat (groups of 10 preachers) that undertake preaching missions. The type of work performed and the duration of that work are left solely to the discretion and conscience of the individual jamaat. Some jamaat choose to serve a short period of time while others preach for months or even years. Although TJ is Deobandi, it allows any Sunni Muslim to join in its missionary work as long as that person accepts the group's austere creed.\n\nFurther:\n\n>In addition to the misconception that TJ is a hierarchical group, perhaps the second most commonly held misconception about the Tablighis is that they adhere to a Wahhabi branch of Islam. In much the same way that there are different denominations of Christians, there are several different branches and sub-branches of Islam. Wahhabism, sometimes also referred to as Salafism, is an orthodox belief system held by the Saudi ruling family and most people in Saudi Arabia. Wahhabism also is the form of Islam practiced by al Qaeda and many militant jihadist groups.\n\n>However, there are indeed some links between Tablighis and the world of jihadism. First, there is evidence of indirect connections between the group and the wider radical/extremist Deobandi nexus composed of anti-Shiite sectarian groups, Kashmiri militants and the Taliban. This link provides a medium through which Tablighis who are disgruntled with the group's apolitical program could break orbit and join militant organizations.\n\n>One apparent manifestation of this nexus was a purported militant offshoot of TJ, Jihad bi al-Saif (Jihad through the Sword), which was established in Taxila, Pakistan. Members of this group were accused of plotting a coup against former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1995. Yet, because of the organization's extreme secrecy, little is known about it other than that it is believed to have developed in reaction to the TJ's apolitical, peaceful stance.\n\n>Although the TJ organization unintentionally serves as a front for, or conduit to, militant organizations such as al Qaeda, there is no evidence that the Tablighis act willingly as a global unified jihadist recruiting arm. Rather, such activities appear to occur without the knowledge or consent of TJ leaders. Additionally, because of the very size of the organization and it activities in Muslim communities in the West, a great many Muslims have had some sort of contact with the group. \n\nImportantly, though \n\n>**TJ itself, however, is not an intentional propagator of terrorism.** "

"Here's the thing, while it is tempting to complain against NDTV, a lot of the fault actually lies with the basic ignorance among Hindus and Hindu activists who either complain against 1) media or 2) Modi/BJP for not doing anything. Most prominent Hindu groups havent so much as issued a joint statement on these vital issues. They should have been aware when the laws were being drafted, but worse they dont realize after thousands of schools have shut down. The same passivity is seen in not building any effective media organizations to cover the atrocities which is what will take the govt to take action. Alternatively, there could have been some common support for people suffering by helping out with aid or protesting govt inaction.\n\n NDTV actually carefully avoids the issue of autonomy. The contrast is too stark - There are dozens of officially Islamic and Christian countries, who internally support their religions. Germany had a church tax for instance. Also, there are countries including the United States which funds evangelism abroad via charities. Scandinavian countries too used to support evangelism abroad. Whereas just basic autonomy is hard to find for Hindus, even in India. Just extend Article 30 provisions to everyone.\n\nForget any 'Hindu Rashtra' etc, which we dont need. All that is required for a revival of dharma knowledge traditions is an active system of learning places, schools, universities etc. \n\nThe reason this hasnt happened is because Hindu groups are more  invested in pointless history debates, instead of things will actually lead to a genuine revival.\n\n"
"He said 'people like this'. \n\nNow what does that mean reading the article?\n\n>“After having lived a major portion of my life in sin, it is now my mission to preach Salafi Islam to my fellow Muslim brethren in Malda district and even outside. I have also made it my mission to bring in as many kafirs as I can within the fold of Islam and save them from going to hell. Ultimately, insha’Allah, **India will join Bangladesh and Pakistan in becoming a Muslim country** and we will have an Islamic belt stretching from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. That day is not far away. Kafirs can live in the Islamic caliphate, but as second class citizens with limited rights as is deemed in the Hadith. It will thus be better for them to become Muslims, because that is the will of Allah,” says Nawab without even batting an eyelid."

Members patrol the streets enforcing dress codes, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, and other behavior it believes to be commanded by Islam.

"> a secular government should not celebrate religious functions\n\nOur 'secular governments' control temple funds ie the donations that go into the temple, the temple land that is leased out etc are managed by government bodies (in most temples). So Hindu festivals have to be celebrated by government sanction especially in temples. **Alternatively, release temples from government control.** Just this week, the 'secular government' of Karnataka decided to cut temple funds to mid-day meals for under previliged kids because the school was managed by RSS man.

Ofcourse this was followed by the famous EVR/Periyar ([who was born in Erode, an early part of Coimbatore district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyar_E._V._Ramasamy#Early_years)) and his own highly popular militant [humanist/rationalist movement](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=c4BMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=periyar+atheist&source=bl&ots=HoUZrN8mG2&sig=_lzyJU78ci8Mr_CD6G81aZrP5bI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwia54fUseDSAhUFpI8KHaRWAXI4ChDoAQhUMAk#v=onepage&q=denial%20of%20god&f=false)."
"That article is a lot of bull. The author has used quotes which are not properly cited. I did find one quote which was not completely quoted which makes me think the author is cherry picking quotes. \n\nEVR derided the brahmin minority which was ruling the majority comprised of backward castes and dalits where he talks about powerful minority imposing it's choices on the majority which was/is happening. \n\nWhile I don't agree with what he said about dalits and their leaders as quoted by the author, I'd say it lines up with his general ideology of self respect. He critiques them for begging(in his view) the minority rulers instead of fighting for it. \n\nComing to Islam, he suggested dalits convert to Islam because it offered them equality(in his view) while making it clear that he wants all religions to die. His reasoning was that some people can't give up belief in God that easily. So they can use Islam temporarily.\n\n\nEVR has a lot of problems in his ways. Hindutva or anti dalit is certainly not one of them. He certainly achieved way less than what he set out to. \n\nThe author wants to malign the dravidian parties DMK, ADMK, MDMK and has maligned EVR instead. "

Eventually, he merged his party with the Congress. Once Vaghela had been eased out from the BJP, Narendra Modi ceased to be Keshubhai's favourite. Modi had outlived his utility for Patel. Keshubhai wasn't content with merely sidelining Modi, though; he had him transferred to Delhi as organising general secretary of the BJP. This was no ordinary political transfer.

"I worked in a PSB few years back and still am in the banking sector just on a different capacity so here are my tuppence.\n\n**Recruitment** Banks recruit primarily at two level clerks/assistants and officers.\nAll recruitments are done by a national body i.e. IBPS. The clerks exam is a state level exam as in every bank releases their annual vacancies state wise. Language Proficiency Test or LPT is very much a part of the recruitment process. So if you are appearing from say Gujrat you will have to know Gujrati and so on. You will be always posted within your state boundaries in clerical cadre.\nThe officers level exam is a national level exam and does not actually have any language proficiency test. PSB officers can be posted all over India as and when required. Officers are also transferred quite frequently.  \nIdeally most if not all customer interfacing jobs can be done through clerks. \n\n**Operation** So I don't agree with the sentiment that a Kannada or a Bengali or a Bihari has to walk into a bank in his own state and not find a single employee who can converse with him in his own language. All clerical stuff are bound to know the native language of the state. If they are helpful or just slacking off is another issue.\n\nSecondly, as I said officers are transferred quite often. So if an officer spends six months to a year or even two in one state and then gets transferred to another state I would understand that it gets tough for them to learn a language every single time. There is a steep learning curve in finance and accounting as well that they must necessarily and more importantly master so language might not always be a top priority for them.\n\nHowever, I do agree that all officers should at least have a working knowledge of the local language but it should be done through market forces and not through legislation(some people suggested the north does that, whats stopping the south). Also, encouraging more youths of a particular region to appear for banking exam sounds like a better plan than vying for an executive order which may or may not have other ulterior motives.\n\nAlso, most PSBs are struggling to stay afloat so we are in desperate need to have the best financial managers posted in the best possible places for the turn around let us not put trade barriers in place to retard that momentum.\n\nEdit : Thank you kind redditor :)\n\n"
'Customer facing jobs like the ones in banks,hospitals, Government offices and so on need fair amount of people interacting in the local language. This is irrespective of if its Kannada or Bhojpuri.'
'When hindi is given such a  high priority , and at many times trying to supersede the local language ,it is only natural to secure their own language. \n\nI dont think this is a wrong move in any sense.. You want to serve a said region , then you better learn the local language to interact with them. It should not be the other way round.\n\nUntil all languages are given equal status , and till the natural learning of other language develop , i for one support for protecting regional language in which ever way possible.'
"I don't see anything wrong in it. If we are to make banking inclusive for all in India, we need to ensure that bankers can interact with their clients in the local language."
"Though the headline is full of outrage, is it unreasonable that you integrate into the local culture in order to access a job there? I don't understand why we expect Southerners to be so passive. \n\nWe expect people going to the north to learn Hindi. If someone comes to Uttarakhand, I certainly expect them to integrate socially/linguistically in order to access the job market. That includes reasonable fluency in Hindi. So why do we make the exception for the South?"
"I'm a native Hindi speaker.\n\nIf I wanted to work in Germany, and in particular in a customer-facing role, I would be reasonably expected to learn German. I would not expect my customers to speak with me in English.\n\nSame thing with working in Karnataka: if my work involved dealing with local customers, I should be speaking their language, not expecting them to speak mine.\n\n************\n\nHowever, I don't get the logic for demanding removal of Hindi from Namma Metro boards. It was not there *in place of* Kannada, but as an extra language. What is wrong with that? Can somebody please explain?\n\nIf we allow boards only in Kannada and English, what about visitors from other states who don't know English?\n\nRight now, a foreigner will have an easier time riding the Bengaluru metro, than a visitor from north India who was not lucky enough to know English."
'Very good. '
'On the other hand, why banks just dont post their employees in customer facing roles at such places?\n\nor else, Just ask for their language skills before posting them at any location!!!'
'Well if you interact with customers and majority of your customers speak one language you should learn it.\n\n\nI am sure all these bank folks would learn German in a heartbeat if someone told them they will get a job in a bank in Germany if they know German.'
"I just want to say that I'm really enjoying the discussion in this section. \n\nAs expected, when it comes to languages people get worked up and the discussions get heated since languages are such an essential part of our respective societies and in turn our identities. \n\nIt has been very interesting for me to read very diverse opinions and perspectives regarding this topic. I don't think I have a concrete opinion regarding this matter, but surely this has given me a lot of food for thought. Thanks!"

'RSS scums trying to push Hindi will result in backlash like this '
'I wonder what the reaction will be if there is Marathi imposition like this in banks in Mumbai. '
'It will be interesting to see where this goes.'
"This is saddening. Karnataka is one of the few states which has, in the past, genuinely made an effort to learn hindi and treat it as a bridge language. It's attitude towards Hindi was never as hostile as the other southern states, but it is more so than anyone now, because of the actions of this government. Kannada nationalists have more support than ever, just like Hindi nationalists. We let the nationalists win. "
"It's all BJP and it's mommy RSS' making. No one to blame. Actually, we must admit they are pretty pretty good in making issues out of totally non issues."
'Is this a Bangalore only phenomenon or across the state? What is happening in Marathi speaking areas like Belgaum?'
'As an officer working in Banking sector this is pretty much accurate .Only bit inaccurate is regarding operations.Because when it comes to loan section (or Advance as we call in banking) ,Clericals have very little knowledge or role to play.So when a customer approaches for loan he has to entirely depend on the officer .And in such cases when a Kannadiga walks into an bank ,he will.have issues if the advance in charge both the officers are from different state (Which in many cases tends to be) .That is the reality of the situation.\n\n\n\n '

">When hindi is given such a high priority , and at many times trying to supersede the local language ,it is only natural to secure their own language.\n\nThat already happened in the big cities in Maharashtra. You don't need to know Marathi to do anything there and I doubt half of Mumbaikars can even speak it. I can't blame Southies for being protective. We may live in one country and give priority to English and Hindi but all customs should be respected. \n\nWrt to this case, I think bank employees (and other members of public sector) should maintain relative fluency in Kannada, Hindi and English. Knowing only the latter two does not do justice to the locals."
'> When hindi is given such a high priority\n\nBy other govt authorities you mean?  \n\n>it is only natural to secure their own language  \n\nSo you want to counter one kind of govt. enforcement with another? Great Idea.  \nHow about leaving people alone and let them do their daily job the way they see it fit, instead of intruding and micromanaging by laws.'
'Yes but enforcing it via a GOVT mandate or law is not the solution. There should be limit to where such bodies can govern the way people go about their daily business. People should recognize the merits of learning such soft-skills on their own.'
"> I don't understand why we expect Southerners to be so passive.\n\nBecause Southerners are timid and passive. Think about it. South India is quite different from the northern part of the subcontinent (including North India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). Yet we've never demanded anything. No separate country. Happily lapped up Hindi and mocked the few Tamils who made a fuss. Many Southerners are proud to be have the privilege of speaking Hindi and look down on other Southerners who cannot speak Hindi. Why would Hindi speakers care about imposing their language when we've happily lapped up their imposition before?"
">  is it unreasonable that you integrate into the local culture in order to access a job there? \n\nIt depends. I, a north Indian guy, worked two years in Kochi. I have friends who were there for 1-2 years in different companies. None of us learned Malayalam. Not a single bit. All of us our worked was done in English and since we were so many North Indians that our manager learned Hindi, lol. They did organised coaching classes and we attended for one week or so, but it was not feasible. The training for our job was already very rough and job was more rough, so in our case doing our job was priority over mixing with regional people. Some of us even had to meet regular people every week. I had same experience in Coimbatore, Chennai and Trivandrum. So if your boss and coworkers willing to help with language issues, you won't face many problems. \n\n(on my job background: At that time I was working in marketing and lubes unit of an Oil PSU. We had so many new launches and had to interact with dealers and all. Some of my friends were working on same project but as an external management consultant. Needless to say, we had very nice bosses).  \n"

Where do I even start?\n\n>I fully understand liberalism is a narrow ideology and only a small permutation in a full universe of political opinions.\n\nAnd yet you choose to generalise liberalism to mean members on this sub. \n\n>So many people self-identify as liberal not because it's one of only a few options but largely because of groupthink.\n\nI don't know if that's true. Liberalism isn't really fashionable unless one is an elite. In which case, we're talking about the 0.1%, who're nothing but a rounding error in India's political sphere. I have encountered very few people who identify themselves as a liberal or a conservative in India. These binaries just don't exist here. People are more partisan than they're ideological. \n\n>And that groupthink, the lack of diversity in their opinions is why I can generalize them just as easily as you did supporters the BJP.\n\nI never mentioned the BJP. You did. But since you've done that already, let me explain why I think the BJP isn't to blame. Had there been no BJP, we'd have had another political party tapping the majoritarian vote bank. BJP is a manifestation of the inherent attitudes of many people in our daily lives. That party could well have been the congress, had it not been BJP.\n\n>Regardless, the principled people who have individual opinions on  issues aren't the breed of Indian I'm talking about, even if they do self-identify as liberal. It's the Barkha Dutts of the world I have no respect for.\n\nI'm not a fan of her either. But she's more articulate than most journalists and quite frankly, her stance on issues is at least consistent and cogent. Even though I don't necessarily agree with all of them. I think she has managed to dispel major stigmas attached to women journalists reporting from the ground and many young women journalists have her (along with many others who came before Barkha Dutt) to thank for that. Yes, I know there's the Radia tapes and everything. But aren't we supposed to consider everyone innocent until the courts deems them guilty?"
"You chose to make a causal comment about liberalism. You chose to bring in the BJP to the discussion. You chose to mention Barkha Dutt.

"Exactly. If the restaurant or pub has clearly declared right at the entrance or on the menu that there's a service charge, you are committing to pay it, and cannot rescind it later. Otherwise, there's always the option of takeaway. I think of service charge as the charge for staying at the establishment, and not ordering delivery/take-away. Otherwise, they could merely increase the prices of the menu items by the service charge % and achieve the exact same outcome anyway, and offer a discount for delivery/takeaway."

MRP is decided by the wholesaler keeping in mind the margin of\nprofit for the retailer and the transport cost. If the retailer is letting go of that margin then he/she is an idiot."
'Idk ask the founders. The company itself is now in the phase of making profits. Plus, the employees are not paid heavy salaries like in other startups. Friday parties cost 1k/head AT MAX. So, just 4k/person/month. Since the pay is lesser than the market, they can afford this.'

"I actually think Rahul Gandhi is a relatively decent person but just not fit as a leader. If we think about it, all the kids of powerful people are on a power trip. I am from Andhra/Telangana so my examples may not be relatable but son of CBN (CM of Andhra) , son of KCR (CM of Telangana) , son of YSR(ex CM of Andhra) all have evidences of acting like entitled assholes. Rahul gets so much of flak but there are some really good traits in him.  He has a certain vibe in him, like as a random person, I'd feel probably comfortable around him while it feels intimidating to get close to some son of a minister. Very admirable trait in my opinion given that his party is literally filled with bootlickers that would make most people power trip and get into a lot of controversies. The bootlickers (Congress MLAs) who bootlick the bootlickers (ex state ministers and CM) who bootlick the bootlickers (ex union ministers) of Rahul Gandhi are more arrogant than him and his mother.

"There is a reason for his such a large influence. Biased he may be (as most here have already beaten that dead horse!), but he is also very truthful. Whatever part of the story he covers, he does it with full conviction and sincerity. Besides, he does the a-grade research for each story and asks questions that dig deep into the core. Ok, granted that the Modi interview wasn't quite much because of his right wing bias. But consider the other interviews he did like Akhilesh Yadav, Arvind Kejriwal, etc.\n\nMost other journos just skim the surface and the whole thing just feels like a scripted sham. With Arnab, you know that he had done the homework properly and the interviewee is just perplexed! (In today's AMA, he seem to have been stressed out or something, because Arnab just isn't like that usually)."
'Heck, Reddit is trending on Indian Twitter thanks to a couple of media channels having picked up the AMA. '
"Yup, RG is pretty down to earth considering his status. He just isn't a really good politician. I guess its a consequence of his simple nature - someone like Modi on the other hand would most likely score as borderline sociopath on a psychology test. "

'RG should have learnt diplomacy a little better. Making the right kind of noise at the right time is what he is lacking. If congress is ever thinking of a comeback then they must let go of the entire Gandhi dynasty from the party. Give tharoor the command.'
'Well, playing the devil\'s advocate, there is a demand for investigative journalism from that side of the story as well. If you observe today\'s mainstream media, the people who debate the *left* side of the story are very intellectual folks like Prashant Bhushan, Shashi Tharoor, etc., whereas on the *right* side of the debate table, you mostly get what you\'ll term as "sanghis" and "bhakts". It ain\'t a fair battle, so we need more intellectual and thinking people on the right side of the table too, right? This is where Arnab Goswami comes into the picture, there is a very high demand for a person who isn\'t totally right aligned (though he may be biased), but is able to explain that side of the story in a logical manner.\n\nAgreed that Arnab\'s pro military stance didn\'t go very well with you guys, but pretty sure you would have been all pitchforks by now if a similar comment had come from a "sanghi" or "bhakt". Similarly, we on the right side also get hurt when someone like Kanhaiya or Omar Khalid shouts the anti-national slogans. We even don\'t like it when someone like Shashi Tharoor tries to glorify such people as freedom fighters, but at least he is tolerable on the TV screen as he is intellectually and logically trying to put forth a point. So, I don\'t understand what problem the liberal left might be having with trying to understand the stance of Arnab Goswami.'

'I am ready with the downboats!'
"> Think about it, there maybe a reason why the liberal side has more intellectual heft like, maybe because it makes more sense \n\nI don't believe that as I happen to know a lot of highly intellectual people on the right side as well. We just don't see them in the media enough.\n\n> People are only calling BS on his I-dare-to-speak-the-truth-to-power narrative. He is being attacked for being a hypocrite and a pretentious a*hole.\n\nLets be honest, everyone does that, isn't it? Even the Owaisi guy likes to believe that he is extremely secular and even Yogi Adityanath says that he is equal to all religions. But we all know that isn't the case. Nobody will admit it on record that they are politically aligned to a particular side for obvious reasons. But as you said, the world isn't binary, there is a lot of grey area between the likes of Shashi Tharoor and Yogi Adityanath, isn't it?\n\n> People who are not right wing are not traitorous anti-nationals. Everybody wants to keep the country together, peaceful and prosperous.\n\nYes, agreed to all that. But pray tell brother, what peace and prosperity does a guy shouting anti-national slogan will bring to the nation? And FoS couldn't be one-sided as well, can it? If some guy has the FoS right to shout anti-national slogan, then may I please also have my own FoS right to call BS to such a thing?"

'> Grammer is actually very very close to Sanskrit than Tamil\n\nNo. Malayalam grammar is yet to significantly diverge from the Tamil grammar. It is significantly different from the Sanskrit or any of the Indo-aryan languages.\n\n> The only difference is the script which resembles and borrows from telegu and Tamil.\n\nThis is wrong as well. Almost all Indian language scripts derived from the [Brahmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmi_script) script of Asokan period. There is no borrowing between different scripts, rather they are all co-eval sister systems.\n\n> About 70% or more so words of Malayalam is borrowed from Sanskrit\n\nI am rather dubious about this claim as well. Are you talking about any specific നിഘണ്ടു? or in terms of words in common use? If the later, English may have a pretty large share now a days.'
'You cannot be more wrong. \n\nEnglish borrows 60% of its vocabulary from Latin and by extension Romance Languages, like French. But it is a Germanic language and more closely related to Nordic languages, which are pretty far from nearby France. \n\nTelugu is a Dravidian language, and pretty much all of regular spoken Telugu uses Dravidian words, Sanskrit was included to enhance the language to include higher concepts or make it more suitable for literature/religious purposes. \n\nA better example is Urdu, it borrows heavily from Persian and Arabic, but it is an Indian language, without Sanskrit there is no Urdu, zero, zilch. Without Sanskrit, Telugu can survive.'
'Words are borrowed due to cultural interactions. They are called loan words.\n\nIndeed, Malayalam has many Sanskrit words but the language wasnt derived from Sanskrit by any means. More like some Sanskrit words entered Malayalam vocabulary and replaced original words.'

'**Microplastics**\n\nMicroplastics are small plastic particles in the environment. While there is some contention over their size, the U.S. National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration classifies microplastics as less than 5 mm in diameter. They can come from a variety of sources, including cosmetics, clothing, and industrial processes.\n\nTwo classifications of microplastics currently exist: primary microplastics are manufactured and are a direct result of human material and product use, and secondary microplastics are microscopic plastic fragments derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris like the macroscopic parts that make up the bulk of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24'

But how pathetic we are in comparison to them.

Every man should learn to be skeptical in the spirit of scientific inquiry, and everybody should learn to tolerate skepticism.\n\nAlso, we Indians these days have tendency to exaggerate our achievements ( [here] (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/indian-prime-minister-genetic-science-existed-ancient-times), [here] (http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/5-howlers-from-the-indian-science-congress/1/411468.html) .\n\n\nIt is not possible that one country/civilisation by itself could have all the knowledge and information that there is ( like a lot of us Indians claim - our vedas & upanishads had pretty much figured everything out, though there are only vague references and not a lot of proofs written down). \n\nAll ancient civilizations made great contributions to all kinds of sciences and mathematics, however, modern scientific progress is the result of collective, and complementary efforts of scientists, academicians, governments and businesses across the world.\n"

These are just from the top of my head. You can search more.'

'aye, i didnt even think i would use modis dialogue in a debate. but seriously, hard work> harvard. \n\nshashi tharoor is an amazing orator and debater but we have no idea about his administrative prowess. stereotyping masses as idiots who are influenced by the powerful corrupt leaders is lame af. people prefer leaders who can be effective and get the work done. this is why parrikar came back to goa. this is why UP landslide happened. heck, this is why sad/bjp got their worst result in punjab as Amarinder singh is respected as a daring and effective leader. i came from sidhus ex constituency, and people still respect his work despite his actions in the comedy show.  he was one of the major reasons aap lost their seats to congress. \n\nin all, shashi tharoor is more of a beaurecrat than politician or even a minister. modi has 15 years of gujarat experience under the belt and a clean image. you can question his stand in the riots, but you cannot question his character. tharoor is more like the mukherjee, he would be made president whne congress ever comes to power, just so that the  congress members do not question raga'
"He needs to communicate with the masses .

It requires *zero* courage to castigate an Empire which fell long before most of you were even born. What is going to happen to you, Lord Curzon rising from the grave to strike you down?\n\nIt's utterly hilarious how some people try to portray him as some kind of brave crusader. He's playing to the crowd with zero risk. Now that's heroic? Come back when he starts talking about *real* unpopular stuff, like giving an opinion on Kashmir which isn't the standard trope. "

'I always admired certain illustrators of his. Ram Waerkar was a favourite. I wonder if he had a website or something.'

'Happy Birthday Uncle Pai. Thank you for so many happy childhood memories. ♥️'
"These were the initial few comic books I read when I was a kid. I read Mahabharat, Krishna, Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and other stories of our freedom fighters through ACK. All thanks to this man.\n\nAnd I will remember this awesome human being with greatest respect.\n\nNow, I'm trying to get my sisters into reading with ACK."
'Every one loves a good tinkle... One way or another. :P'
'Loved those school days when I would spend all my spare time in library reading tinkle and ACK.'
"I grew up reading Tinkle and Amar Chitra Katha. It's a huge shame that Uncle Pai was not recognized for his achivements and conferred any literary or public serve awards. He deserves a Padma Shri at least."

Comics are truly great medium to make kids get into reading and to develop a more open thinking. "
"Shouldn't throw around Bharat Ratna like this. Padma awards are more appropriate."
'Yup! IIRC, he was on of the oldest members of the ACK team. He passed away in the 2000s sometime. Also, his son/daughter was also a part of ACK team. Loved his illustrations. '
'Harhar so did we. The ones trying to impress the teachers took the ack ones and then ended up borrowing tinkle from us. '
'Right? Mum always made sure we had a subscription to tinkle, chandamama and champak no matter where we transferred.

'I agree with your point and also know that many non-deserving folks have won the Ratna as well, but I personally feel that entertainers should be kept out of that list and only policy makers(T.N Sheshan) and actual nation builders(like E.Shreedharan) should be awarded the Ratna.'
"I'd reckon that providing the kind of entertaining and educational material these guys did for the youth of India is very much a crucial part of nation building."
"In this kind of debate it's good to remember these kind of people do what they do day in and day out, not because they are expecting or need an award. \n\nIf their motivations were not award based what is the use of showing appreciation in the form of awards?\n"
"> If their motivations were not award based what is the use of showing appreciation in the form of awards?\n\nThe motivation is for us (country people) to show them the gratitude for the good stuff that they have given us. Its obvious that Pran and Pai are going to keep on publishing even if we don't honor them with any awards. I for one, have grown up reading Tinkle and Chacha Chowdhary comics, so certainly feel that they should be honored (not necessarily Bharat Ratna, but at least some award). Otherwise, your same question could be turned inverse as what is the need for creative folks to keep on churning good stuff, if they don't even get any appreciation?"
'RIP,\n\nSomething that can only happen in India, I wish our sportsmen and women had better infra (other than cricket).'
"If there ever was a time to be outraged, this is it.\n\nThe sports ministries in india are regularly filled with cronies.\n\nMinisters steal berths on flights reserved for our athletes - *for the olympics*.\n\nIf there's a topic Modi can actually fix with his mandate it's definitely an issue like this which will always be used for horse trading with a coalition.\n\nSports is a subject which India can and will begin to excel in as nutrition levels improve in our country.\n\nBut without actual reform this will be still born, and any gains will be squandered because the sports ministry is a bargaining chip.\n\n\n"
"Your wish is no one's command and it will never be. Indian system will make sure of that. This is just one incident as the legends would say."
'I have to admit that cricket has taken a disproportionate chunk of attention in Indian psyche. Other sports are so neglected. It was such an irony that Chak De song was used in cricket matches more than in Hockey matches. As they say, cricket is not a sport but a religion in India. I love cricket but I hate religion. Ultimately, religion corrupts and BCCI is one of the most corrupt bodies in India. \n\nIf the patriotic billionaires of India give even 10% of their investment in IPL instead to other sports, India can bring many medals. Many laurels India can bring home if even 10% of the money invested in IPL is channelled to other sports. Once the medals come, people will follow it. Indian sports market is tiny because it is mostly hogged by Cricket. The small investments by multinationals would diversify and broaden the market. In less than 10 years multinationals will start getting returns. A lot of people will actually get glued to the TV to watch wrestling or volleyball or  swimming. Multinationals, big corporate need not see putting money on volleyball or wrestling as a charity. It can be a real investment that gives return, not in a year, but definitely in a decade. The returns are much bigger than the returns they can make in just Cricket. '

"LOL the type of real shit that only Reddit can down vote on. Shame. Great message and highly agreeable, other sports need more money and attention. Cricket simply isn't everything as they've all come to believe. "

"100% goes to charity? Need proof for that. Also, which charity it goes to and how it spends it's money. Because as far as I know, Patanjali isn't registered as a charity at all. "
"But, Patanjali has a website, which is running on evil chips created by Chinese and American MNC's. So even Patanjali is contributing to plundering the Indian economy. \n\nBut we know someone so heavily supported by the Indian govt will not do any such thing, so the natural conclusion is that paying more money to MNC's is better than paying less to Indian companies (after all, even Patanjali chose to use MNC's instead of pure Indian chips) so its better to pay a higher price to MNC's than a lower price to Patanjali.The more money we pay, the better for India.Its what Patanjali does ;) "

"Looks like the ad is comparing patanjali's pouch packing (cheaper obviously ) to the competitor's bottles."
"Misleading advert aside, the price difference between the products is substantial. Even if the quality of Patanjali may not be as good as the MNC's but still in terms of value of money, it beats them hands down. Also remember these oils are commodities, the oil supplier for Patanjali will be the same as that for the MNCs. So either Patanjali's cost structure is very low or they are making much less profit than the MNCs, which is great news for the consumer and for the overall economy. "

More and more idiots online is NOT a bad thing after all. We fucking need rationality in this country, getting them internet is a great idea.

'What Ramdev is doing is a very well played out business tactic. In the recent few years, we\'ve witnessed a very prevalent nationalistic sentiment across the nation. Nationalism in itself is a very sensitive issue, and Baba Ramdev is making the best of it. \n\nPatanjali products are now being advertised as not only Ayurvedic, but also Made In India, For the India. MNC\'s are being criticised for their practise to take the profits back to their home country, as per the Patanjali ads. This brand also claims to donate all the profits to NGO\'s/Charity. \n\nThis is a very smart business move, earlier people were a lot more conscious on choosing the Ayurvedic/Organic products over the "Harmful chemical made products" of the MNC\'s, so Baba banked on that perception. Now he\'s claiming his products and associating them with Nationalism.\n\nA lot like Akshay Kumar, who\'s a Canadian citizen but has allegedly been accused of manipulating his taxes and having a few of his films being exempt from taxes altogether. Akshay is a great actor, but also a better businessman, mainly because he uses the same Nationalism tactic in his recent movies. \n\nNot that it\'s something unethical/bad. It\'s very smart of both of these men. '

"Yep all muslims are progressive beacons of virtue. Triple Talaq and nikah halala were non-issues created by the BJP. The people protesting against them were BJP stooges, paid for by Modi and the RSS. In reality, everyone in India, including most Hindus, want Shariah, the word of God. It's only Modi and the RSS acting spoilsport, with regressive and blasphemous ideas such as UCC."

'Yes.. And the customs of dowry and child marriage are openly opposed by lot of members of the community who had/have those practices. Also government imposed strict laws against dowry and the person or family members can go to jail for that... Now can the same be said in the case of triple talak? How would the people of rIndia react to strict laws including non bailable jail time imposed on cases of triple talaq?

Though we now know that progress comes at its own speed and all that changes with a new year is a calendar but back then, the start of a new century sounded like the start of something bigger.\n\nIn the year 2000, television saw a massive face-lift. Ekta Kapoor became the queen of television but there was something that could trump the saga of Virani family and as surprising as it may sound, it was a show about GK.\n\nThe first season ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ premiered in the year 2000 and along with “creating history” with contestants like Harshvardhan Nawathe, it certainly created a legacy for Indian television. With its easy to understand format and strong emphasis on general knowledge, this show became the glue that joined families at 9 pm every night. From the ever-occupied mother who sped from the kitchen to the television set to answer every question to the young child in the family who still had GK as a subject in school, this show covered all its bases. And it was in this unity, that KBC found a sweet spot that Ramanand Sagar found with Ramayan in the 80s.\n\nThe show celebrated knowledge in all its glory. It gave people a sense of confidence that if you are aware and knowledgeable, the world will celebrate you. And this celebration didn’t come empty handed, winning a crore looked like a real possibility. The geeks had a way of cashing in on their knowledge and this was the way they could do it with all the applause. No matter what social or economic class one came from, in the eyes of ‘computer ji’, all were equal. The show inspired people to read more just so one could keep up with Amitabh Bachchan’s questions.\n\nKBC told us that not knowing was not cool and had millions across the country struggling to get to the target, the hot seat.\n\nKBC’s first crorepati, Harshvardhan Nawathe, became a celebrity because of his GK. KBC’s first crorepati, Harshvardhan Nawathe, became a celebrity because of his GK.\n\nSadly, those days are a part of sweet nostalgia now.\n\nThe show is currently in its 9th season but the love affair it once had with gyaan has been over for a while now. The two have been keeping up a marriage that has a lot at stake but we all know that the show’s obsession for sob stories has superseded its love for gyaan.\n\nIn the past few seasons, a major shift can be observed in the what we earlier called a quiz show and this came in when KBC felt like it had to compete with the Indian Idols of the TV world. Every contestant that came on the show had a back story to tell and more often than not, it explored the emotional aspects of their life. The quiz show turned into a reality show with a few questions sprinkled in just to keep the format intact. This change in gear from celebrating knowledge to celebrating people was noticeable and the audience could figure that out. Even in the current season, the questions and the lifelines exist but not much time is spent on them. The real drama on the show arises when someone narrates a tragic tale and the producers of the show emphasise on it by playing Black’s theme music in the background. We’ve seen various versions of these on every talent show but wasn’t KBC much more than that?\n\nCall it over-dosage of human interest stories, but the audience doesn’t shed tears in front of their television sets as often as they used to. In fact, we just sit through them waiting for the next question to pop up on the screen. ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ was for the aam janta who could vicariously live through the contestants that got to the glorious hot seat. The aspirational chair gave the message that no matter where you are in life but if you can answer 15 GK questions, you can potentially win big money for it.\n\nThe glorious days when KBC celebrated knowledge are long gone. It’s all about selling sob stories now. The glorious days when KBC celebrated knowledge are long gone. It’s all about selling sob stories now.\n\nKBC still boasts of high ratings but let’s be honest here, it’s not like Indian TV has such gems that the show is competing against. On one hand, there’s the ever voyeuristic ‘Bigg Boss’ that feeds on our cheap thrills and on the other hand, we have the world of desi fantasy that apparently competes with ‘Game of Thrones’. So clearly, if KBC is the front runner here, we’re not surprised.\n\nLock kiya jaye? has lost its charm now because we all know that after a 3-minute video explaining the struggles of a contestant, the producers will probably not kick him off in the first five questions. After a story that follows shots of tears in his eyes, the show won’t brutally eliminate him in a swift second. But such is the world of KBC now. The show that inspired the aam janta has turned into a CSR initiative with a celebrity at its helm but the glorious days when it made us pick up the newspaper will always be fondly remembered.\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"There was a show on Sony around the same time the good old KBC was airing on Star. Jeeto Chappar Phaadke hosted by Govinda. I felt that was a more fun show, better set decor, also the host does not have a chair. Govinda stands while the contestant is comfortably perched on the Hot Seat. That's pure Respect the Contestant 101. No sob stories and then getting eliminated 5 mins later. "
'We love the poor(with good reason as most of the population is dirt poor). So of course every contestant is handicapped and/or poor with old loving parents at home with admirable and/or relatable unfulfilled dreams that the contestant plans to fulfill with the prize money.'
'I stopped watching a few years back. One thing that bothered me was when the show first started, the value of the Indian rupee was much higher than what it is now. They have still not changed the intermediate increments. Only change they added was the 5cr prize which people seldom reach. I bet AB got his salary inflation adjusted or better.'
'To selling government propaganda. \n\nAll the while celebrating the life of a tax evader. '
'Celebrating victims is now the global trend, KBC is just following it.'
"Apart from  the sob stories they do bring to light some pressing issues and important stories which need to be told. They've recently started bringing special guest to the hot seat who are crusaders for social change who can serve as an inspiration for millions as KBC is the most watched show in the country currently. "
"My personal thought on the 7 Crore question. . \n\nI think it's gimmicky to just make a flashy animation & highlight the 7 Crore text when a person reaches the 11th question..\n\nThe idea should be to add a certain set of requirement to unlock the 16th question, so it feels special to reach the final question of the game.."
"Watch this show for Panama Mama's great expressions."
'Not completely shows fault it has been customized to get as much viewership as possible. People tend to get lot more emotionally involved with a background and the question bank is customized according to the contestant.\n\nThe truth is that most have shifted to other medium of entertainment. The show is just a mirror of its viewers'
'Still much better than the competition. The only other show I can tolerate is Tenali Rama'
"I have appeared on the show and this is how it goes:\n\n* People appear for audition where they are asked to tell their story\n* This is sent to Sony execs who select candidates based on 'who would look good on TV'\n* Then a list of 10 candidates is made who would appear for 'Fastest Finger First'\n* A team is sent to the homes of all the 10 FFF candidates one - two weeks prior to KBC episode shooting\n* Based on who comes to the hot seat the movie is shown\n\nI can tell you based on experience that none of it is rigged\n\n"
'They make it for those who win. Post the game. I think. '
"While I'm not denying the show has its share of rigging a sappy sob story, however the short films that you're talking about are definitely made after the episode recording.\n\nIts not a live show."

"Some questions,\n\n* When the jodidaar lifeline is selected, does the jodidaar discuss the answer with the ppl near him/her (or just look at his phone in case they are allowed in the studio) before coming to help the contestant\n\n* Why haven't i seen anyone losing in the early stages when they have their lifelines intact, and they are sure of an answer which is actually incorrect. It must happen a lot, but it doesn't on the show. Which is suspicious.\n\n* For phone a friend, do all the three guys that are selected by the contestant (and the friends of 9 other contestants who aren't in the hot seat), told to be on standby for the enirety of the show, and wait in case they are called? What if the friend doesn't pick up the call? "
'"Who would look good on TV"\n\nYa, thats surely not rigged.'
'Interesting. Thanks for sharing :)'
'* Everyone in the audience is made to deposit their phones before getting seated. This is to make sure the show is not leaked. Only the crew carry their phones. No chance for the Jodidar to search on the phone. Jodidar can discuss with people sitting next to him before getting called near the hot seat. \n\n* After a contestant is selected in FFF and before the show begins, there is a half an hour gap where the jodidar and family members are seated in a particular location, everyone is miked and the contestant is told repeatedly to stay calm and use all the lifelines before selecting an answer. Even Amitji speaks with the contestant for a couple of minutes before the actual show is taped. \n\n* As soon as a contested is selected in FFF, some team members contact their Phone a Friend friends and are told to be available for the next three hours. This is done only for the person who gets to the hot seat\n\n'

"It's sounds creepy to me because of the 15 days with male priests part. Looks like the urban crowd is getting a bit too hung up and off track on the 'topless girls' part, from what I read it sounds like these are young kids, have you ever been to a village? Most children even roam naked if not topless, even children of rich families, nothing sexual about it (if you get aroused by seeing naked children then off yourself or head to therapy). Also traditional Tamil/South Indian attire didn't include a top, women only wore a skirt (pavadai) and necklaces, sarees didn't include a blouse throughout India, things only changed after the conservative morals set by the Islamic and Christian invaders, this weird rural custom is probably a hangover from those times. The practice is certainly anachronistic in our current society and should be ended (mainly because of the obligation to dress in that way - forced by the male priests). I believe that as long as it is not coerced or sexually explicit there is nothing inherently wrong about nudity though."

A lot of people have pointed out that he was the PM because he was the son of Motilal Nehru, so, of course, he laid foundations to what Congress has become today, and to not pay attention to what kind of leadership we have in opposition will lead to a weaker government as well, which is the case right now. So yes, it matters that our first PM might have had an affair with a departing viceroy's wife. The British were not here to do us favours, they were trying to run away with whatever they could, and possibly Nehru aided them by not heeding to important matters but having a clandestine affair. \n\nhttp://www.radiolab.org/story/i-dont-have-answer/\nFor those with time, check this story out. \nIn 1987, Gary Hart was a young charismatic Democrat, poised to win his party’s nomination and possibly the presidency.

Please refer to our statement which has been published on the web site of Bhutan\'s foreign ministry on June 29, 2017."Reacting to the developments in Doklam, Bhutan had on June 29 issued ain which it clearly stated that the construction of the road inside Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the agreements and affects the process of demarcating the boundary between the two countries.In the press release, Bhutan said that the Chinese Army started constructing a motorable road from Dokola in the Doklam area towards the Bhutan Army camp at Zompelri on June 16, 2017.It further said that the boundary talks between Bhutan and China were under way and the two countries had written agreements of 1988 and 1998 stating that they agree to maintain peace and tranquility in their border areas pending a final settlement on the boundary question. The two countries have also agreed to maintain status quo on the boundary as before March 1959 and refrain from taking unilateral action, or use of force, to change the status quo of the boundary.Bhutan has hoped that the status quo in the Doklam area would be maintained by China as before 16 June 2017.The Chinese diplomat, while acknowledging that Bhutan had intially protested about Beijing\'s violation in the Doklam area, was quoted as saying, "After the incident, the Bhutanese made it very clear to us that the place where the trespassing happened is not Bhutan\'s territory."She was further quoted as saying that "Bhutanese find it very strange that the Indian border troops are on the Chinese soil," and implied that her views have been gleaned from Bhutanese state media and legal blogs which have "more convincing information".However, Bhutan has denied all these claims.India has also cited the Bhutanese foreign ministry as emphasizing that "the construction of the road inside Bhutanese territory is a direct violation of the 1988 and 1998 agreements between Bhutan and China and affects the process of demarcating the boundary between these two countries."India has conveyed to China that the road construction would represent a significant change of status quo with serious security implications for New Delhi.India has maintained both sides should first pull back their troops for any talks to take place.and maintains contacts with Beijing through its diplomatic mission in New Delhi.Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks to resolve boundary dispute, while India and China have completed 19 rounds of talks.(With inputs from ANI)\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'So let us summarize what we have so far. \n\nClaim 1:  A Chinese diplomat claimed that Bhutan accepted Beijing\'s claim that Doklam belongs to China. The Chinese diplomat claims his/her source as being conveyed through "diplomatic channels". The Bhutanese government has not released an official statement collaborating this. \n\nClaim 2:  An Indian newspaper claimed that Bhutan has rejected Beijing\'s claim that Doklam belongs to China. The Indian newspaper claims his/her source as being conveyed by "Bhutanese officials" via telephone. The Bhutanese government has not released an official statement collaborating this. \n\nSo we have 3 options. \n\n- Believe Claim 1 and not believe Claim 2.\n\n- Believe Claim 2 and not believe Claim 1. \n\n- Do not believe either Claim 1 or Claim 2. \n\nI chose option 3 because there is no official collaboration from the Bhutanese government. Which one do you chose and why? \n\nRemember,  a hypocrite is someone who believes things when they benefit India, and disbelieves things when they do not benefit India. Do not be a hypocrite. '

Has Bhutan officially requested Indian troops to help defend Doklam?\n\nDo not be a hypocrite. \n\nIf our criteria that Bhutanese official statement is the only thing that is believed, then anything that does not have the Bhutanese official blessing is by definition a lie. So since India claims that Bhutan requested India's help, yet nobody can produce the official Bhutanese document that says this, what can we conclude? \n\nDo not be a hypocrite. Do not simply adopt one set of beliefs because it benefits India, and a different set of beliefs because it does not help India. \n\nWhere is the official Bhutanese document that request Indian troops to help defend Doklan? If you cannot find it, you must conclude that Indian troops are illegally occupying what is either Bhutanese territory or Chinese territory. \n\nBe a man/woman of principle and do not be a hypocrite. \n\n"

Discussions are on,” Shah had said during the end of his press meet to spark speculation.\n\n“The issue of cow protection has always been dear to us. Now, we expect a dedicated ministry to support and boost an entire cow-friendly ecosystem,” said the VHP’s Ayodhya-based spokesman Sharad Sharma.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

Also festival director asked these delegates to stand and they refused.

There were no reports of these guys being arrested. \n\nMy point is, I'm not sure police should be blamed for these arrests. Unless state govt. give a clear directive(which wont happen because of SC order) that dont arrest people who sit at national anthem, imo the hands of police are tied. Especially in the case of film festivals where police, media and BJP cadres are present. "

'I see your point and yes ideal scenario the complainant needed to hear some home truths and clearly pointed out to her that the police are not her private army.\n\nBut i have two rejoinders.\n\n1. If you spend 24 hours in a police station you will see for yourself that 90% of the time they are handling drama. Husband wife, neighbour, landlord tenant you name it. Totally civil matters with no cognizable offense - as they discovered in this case - or where their only job is to arbitrate and settle (mandoli in marathi) things to the satisfaction of both parties. Because, the alternative - record in diary, file FIR, appear in court is often unnecessary, an overkill for the situation and always painful. You will be surprised how often the complainants are otherwise normal people who become hyper and raving borderline lunatics if you just press their buttons. The police station environment is a stage of heightened emotions in a way. People are playacting and if you call them out as a duty officer you could be in for a long day.\n\n2. If they send her away without recording the complaint then they are leaving themselves vulnerable to follow up enquiries in case the woman goes to their region heads or to the media or local political powers. Remember, the law is very pro woman in a largely misogynist society - you do not want to be caught in that situation.\n\nConsidering the above, the cops did their best to diffuse an ugly situation. Was it ideal? You are right to say no. But was it better than how any other police department would have handled it? Undoubtedly.\n\n(Noida Police: Oh chori, humara time barbaad na karr. Doosri gaadi bulale aur ghar jake soja.)'
'Makes sense. Thanks. **If** a strong case can be made, and is made, it would be the ideal end to this situation. Not beating the floor with a belt and Shahid screaming with a smile. \n\nI mentioned \n\n>There could be a lack of substantial proof\n\nA lot of solutions in India are ad hoc in nature, and that shines light on mistakes and problems that need to be corrected.

">Asian countries in general racist\n\nAfrican countries are racist too,generally against Asians.I remember a Nigerian show that made fun of a Chinese on stage by slanting his eyes and saying 'CHing chong ching' and everyone was laughing on stage.\n\nIn general most [thrid/second world countries](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--tV2H69L9--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/18ihdde7eww1yjpg.jpg) are racist.Only the first world countries can be said to have any kind of tolerance for other cultures and regions."
">Asian countries in general are racist.\n\nChina (Beijing, Guangzhou) didn't seem racist at all. There was none of the staring nor any of the getting ripped off by cab drivers either. Felt very safe. \nSame in Philippines and Japan. \n\n"
' This is a common misconception, that it has to do with the West somehow. There\'s been a *long* history of preference of lighter skin color in Asia, dating back millenia. This manifested itself particularly strongly in sexual preference of lighter-skinned women, but it goes beyond that.\n\nDark-skinned men(within the cultural context) were also treated less favorably, although not as starkly as for women. You can see this in China\'s history as well as the rest of East Asia and Indochina. Lighter-skin "Aryans"(using scare quotes for reasons you all know why) were seen as higher status than dark-skinned Dravidians. \n\n'
'>western standards.\n\nthis  is the most common misconception.the \'fairness\' obsession   predates western influence.It can be traced back to Ariyan/Persian(not Hitler\'s version) influence. Look at the  Hindu goddess (High-culture Goddess),they  reflect nothing of  the  majority Indians. \n\ndark skinned Indians aspire to become "pale" (by applying all creams available under the sun) and they only want "pale" skinned heroines to wank off to. Tamil cinema is the best example.   Tamilians are very dark and could pass off for Africans but even a cursory glance at the Tamil heroines ,in the last 50 years, would expose that almost all Tamil heroines are fair skinned North Indians,non-Tamil south Indians, TamBrahms. Even worse, in some Tamil films they cuss dark people (in other words, they spit on their own audience and people lap it up). \n\nHere is a sampler. The hero riding a two-wheeler stops at a traffic signal and looks at a girl whose face is covered with a dupatta. Hero tries to make a move on her.  When the girl removes her veil to reveal her “unattractive” (read:dark) face, the hero,who is dark himself,  spits on the ground in a display of revulsion and contempt for her. I cannot imagine a film elsewhere in the world containing such a sickening scene. \n\na scene like this in an bollywood film, would at least have  got condemned and  opened a dialogue. \n\nedit: do you think someone like Aishwarya Rai wouldn\'t have been considered "beautiful"  in Indian subcontinent  before the arrival of Europeans?  '
'First step is to accept that we have a problem, and to spread awareness of the problem.\n\nI also believe that besides casteism, part of the reason is that the average Indian isn\'t exposed to other races. We know that whites used to rule us. We know that "chinki" people dress well and look smart. But other than that, we don\'t know much. I\'m talking about the average Bollywood watching Indian.\n\nSo the second step is to popularize great positive black and Asian leaders and figures.'
'Wow really? There is widespread discrimination of Indians in Africa too. '
'> You might be surprised to know that the Pope is catholic !!\n\n\n\nTIL \n\n\n\n**Mind=Blown**'
'Why not? Are you saying that people are not beaten up because of their race in Europe or the US?'
"You're an NRI who is constantly praising the US and bashing India. I don't think anyone here cares what you have to say. I don't even know why you are here in the first place given how hostile you are to India and constantly praising the US. \n\nTypical mercenary NRI.

People actually have respect for each other, if not, they at least pretend 24x7. \n\nIn India, oh good lord everyone's entitled and power hungry and wants to show off whatever *power* he/she has. A very common & widespread example would be how people in India treat waiters in restaurants. Another would be, how we casually litter in *public places*, because we lack respect for things which are not our own.\n\nAnyway, rather than bashing the critic for being an NRI/or whatever, how about you take in whatever is meaningful and if possible try doing your best to fix these problems and move on.\n\nP.S: I'm assuming all the downvoters of that comment are the *modern, liberal* and  **proud** Indians."

The 2 star hotel staff or hostel management was always nice or never rude. Maybe I got lucky but in general many of my fellow travelers shared the same feeling. I and others of course had our own frustrations with local co-workers or friends at certain events being rude and obnoxious, but that had nothing to do with the travel infrastructure. \nI am always on defensive when traveling within India about getting taken for a ride and makes it less likely to enjoy the travel and stay, unless I am with a large group where there is always one smart guy who will make sure we are not taken advantage of.

'1) Endogamy of upper castes is a myth. Mixing has been going on for centuries (though people are ill informed about it now).\n\n2) The reason for what you observe is that invaders, tourists and visitors preferred to associate with (and eventually marry/have sex with) the Indians of higher caste. Furthermore, upper castes in general are descendants of higher classes of old Vedic society, meaning they all have some shared ancestry and genetics from regions as far as Iraq in the west and some regions of Central Asia.\n\nThe combination of two factors have helped the upper castes retain some distinction from the rest. In fact, a Brahmin or Kshatriya of any state is much more likely to look different from any other caste of his/her state, and the reason is not endogamy but mixing.......\n\nExamples: Upper caste (North) western Indians have Greek admixture, easily observable by the remnant "Greek toe" found amongst these people. It will NOT be as easily seen in eastern states of India.\n\nPlenty of other examples but no scope to explain here.'
'Important disclaimer: the older Aryan _invasion_ theory, which claims that enlightened Aryan invaders came to India on horses and subjugated/pushed the natives further south has been rubbished multiple times. It is also crucial to not attempt to "attack" this argument as literally nobody whose opinion counts for shit takes it remotely seriously anymore.\n\nAryan *migration*, which postulates that north Indians are migrants originally from somewhere around Eastern Europe, is generally accepted (although not free of controversy). I am a linguist, so I can only talk about the linguistic parts confidently: there is no doubt at all that Indo-Aryan languages are extremely closely related to the languages of Europe; they share prototypically Indo-European features and a prototypical Indo-European lexicon in important areas. The very, very widely accepted linguistic theory is that these languages originated in modern Ukraine, and spread outwards from there.\n\nThe history of Dravidian languages is (relatively) extremely unknown; about the only thing that can be said with absolute certainty as that they are completely unrelated to Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nDoes this make the theory that "Aryans" migrated to north India true? Not inherently but it strongly suggests that it is very plausible. There is other evidence from other domains that I am not an expert in and will therefore not talk about.'

But, what is more surprising that PMO and other few offices of Central government don\'t have Aadhaar card details of Modi\'s Ministers.\n\nModi Government has made linking Aadhaar card mandatory to get benefits of all government services that the 125 crore Indian citizen utilise. But, PMO does not have the information about the Aadhaar card details of its own Ministers working under Modi government. This information has come to light through a reply which was provided to RTI Activist Anil Galgali for his query.\n\nGalgali said, "It is surprising to see that PMO or other few concern departments don\'t have data of Aadhaar card with them of their own ministers. Yes, PM does have an Aadhaar card number but due to security reason details were not given to me."\n\nMoreover, the RTI application filed by Galgali was transferred to 5 different Ministries. The RTO application made rounds to Cabinet Secretariat, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Information and Technology Ministry, and finally reached UIDAI where Galgali got an answer from the Under Secretary, PMO.\n\nThe information regarding the PM\'s Aadhaar number was rejected under Section 8(1) of the RTI Act 2005. Information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information officer or State Public Information officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such Information.\n\n"It shows that they say something but don\'t follow it. I would like to appreciate the efforts of RTI activist who brought this information in light. Common people are not getting benefits of government schemes unless they have Aadhaar card linked to Gas connection, bank etc but here we have ministers who have not shared their Aadhaar numbers it seems. That\'s why PMO or other departments don\'t have information about this." said Shaktisinh Gohil, a Congress leader.\n\nGovernment is advertising with big ads and are asking people to link their Aadhaar cards with their Bank accounts and even their mobile connections along with PAN cards. But, considering the information revealed after the RTI by Galgali, it seems that Modi\'s own ministers have ignored PM Modi\'s instructions. It also seems like rules for common people are slightly a bit different than the ones in power.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

His conscience and his father’s lessons on honesty figure higher on the list than his needs, he says.\n\nLast week, Kapri walked into a police station at Delhi’s domestic airport to deposit a bag left behind in his vehicle by a passenger earlier that day. The officer on duty was shocked to find that it contained gold jewellery, a laptop, an iPhone, a camera and $70 — items amounting to a whopping Rs 8 lakh.\n\nKapri claimed that he knew what was there inside the bag but decided to return it to its owner. The police later found out that the bag belonged to Mubisher Wani, a resident of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. He was given back the bag that same evening.\n\nKapri is a debt-ridden man and is struggling to repay a loan of Rs 70,000 to a private financier in his home town in Bihar’s Banka. His father took a loan of Rs 1 lakh in 2008-09 on a 5% per month interest rate to marry off two of his daughters. The simple farmer, who did not have a permanent source of income, could not even pay the monthly interest amount.\n\nThe interest amount accumulated with every passing month and the pressure to return the money intensified, initially with warnings and later with life threats to the family members. With the added compound interest, the Rs 1 lakh loan increased to Rs 2 lakh within 2 years.\n\nThe family sold a small piece of their land but it was not enough to pay off the loan. In 2011, Kapri’s elder brother left home for Rajkot in Gujarat to earn a livelihood. But his meagre income proved insufficient to cater to his personal expenses and needs of his family of 5, leave alone repaying the loan.\n\n“My father was under stress and mother fell sick but we had no money to buy medicines for her. With each passing day, our financial condition was deteriorating. Though I was only 17, I had no choice but to quit my studies and support my family in the crisis. In 2012, I came to Delhi in search of a job,” Kapri says.\n\nThe youngest among four siblings, Kapri recalls he could appear only in 2 subjects in his Class 10 examination because he met with an accident. “That accident changed my life. Family’s responsibility took over my books and dreams of becoming an engineer. Destiny brought me to the streets of the national capital and I ended up becoming a cleaner at a taxi stand at Delhi airport,” he says.\n\nBefore completing two years, Kapri had learnt how to drive a car. His cousin, Pintu, took up the role of his driving instructor in addition to being his only guardian in the city. Kapri now aspires to own one for a better life.\n\nKapri lives in a 10x10 rented room with his two roommates, who too work as drivers, on the first floor of a building in Mehram Nagar, an urban village near the Delhi airport. An iron door opens into the room that has an open kitchen with a gas stove and cylinder on the floor. The front wall has 2 cloth hangers that struggle to lift the weight of the clothes of the 3 occupants. On the left side is a small mirror which the room partners share.\n\n“The fan in my room blows out hot air and makes it difficult for us to fight the scorching heat and sleep. But the kind of appreciation I have received from my friends, neighbours from my home town and here in Delhi after the incident gives me peace of mind. I stuck to the lessons of my father and feel satisfied. My moral values are greater than my personal needs,” Kapri said.\n\nAsked what he would do if he has Rs 8 lakh of his own, Kapri says, “I will first repay the loan. From the remaining amount, I will purchase my own taxi that will certainly improve my lifestyle.”\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"\'Hegemony of Western media has to end\'"\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2nUAIjtkMA\n\nHe\'s far better than paid journos - Prannoy, Barkha (Radia Tapes?) and Rajdeep.

"ribiy partisanship aside what's your take on this guy? Do you think he was a wise choice inspite of all of his baggage? \n\n"
"Modi certainly didn't when he drank water and walked out of Karan Thapar's show."
'I have not watched much of Arnab, and from what I have seen (a few debates, and interviews) he strikes be as an extreme hothead with no regard to conduct conversation in a way that would lead you to some meaningful result of that conversation. He regularly yells and strawmans other peoples position, he often engages in ad-hominem attacks and so many other fallacies that tells you that he is neither well educated, but to a greater degree not interested in opposing views and wants to impose his views by the means of yelling and belittling his opponent. \n\nEven considering that he has questioned every politician of every party, its his conduct that is just not good. He has no nuance, and his objective doesn\'t seem to be to reach the truth, but come out as a chest thumping champion by being loud, and rude. \n\nHis success demonstrates that as a society we are impressed by not so much the conduct of a man, but how he comes across on your television screen. What they see is a confident man yelling and shouting at the top of his voice to make his narrative sound correct. But when you see underneath, you see a hollow, boastful, ignorant person who is just their to assert his dominance. As for how to conduct a good talk with anyone; whether it be someone he agrees, or disagrees with; he demonstrates what exactly is not to done. What the discussion is about is muddied by this behaviour and is no good. But apparently that\'s what people enjoy to see on their T.V\'s and is a subset of our modern day "reality T.V" inspired  route, where unfortunately reality is the most badly affected because nobody cares about that. Everyone just cares about winning and shifting the narrative in their favour. In such a case, I find people like him to be doing a disservice to the community by  pushing their own ideas too much without allowing other people to make a case, and when they do he indulges in personal insults and strawmanning their argument which really doesn\'t help the overall situation. \n\nI don\'t have much of a political interest or in journalism. But I can clearly see by his past behaviour that his conduct is not ideal, and if that\'s the best the nation has to offer, we can surely do better.'

The name derived from the idea that events are seen candidly, as a fly on a wall might see them. In the purest form of fly-on-the-wall documentary-making, the camera crew works as unobtrusively as possible; however, it is also common for participants to be interviewed, often by an off-camera voice.\n\nExamples include Cops, Deadliest Catch, Survivor, Big Brother, Dynamo: Magician Impossible and Weiner.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28'

Funnily enough, this convinced him finally to shut up and focus on governance, though imo, it's too little too late. \n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the 2014 electoral results:\n\n\n\n> AAP got to 2.1% of the national vote share (in 2014), (but) 53.3% of all its votes (were) from just 21 constituencies in Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh. So rest of the country, no less than 411 Lok Sabha constituencies, contributed 46.7% of AAP votes- on an average a little over 14,000 votes per constituency or about 1.2% of the average electorate sample. These figures do not reflect any significant penetration across the country.\n\n\n\n[Source](https://medium.com/@c_aashish/the-aam-aadmi-party-aap-lok-sabha-2014-performance-5f2e5f99d618)"

'**Nandi (bull)**\n\nNandi (Sanskrit: नन्दि, Tamil: நந்தி, Kannada: ನಂದಿ, Telugu: న౦ది, Odia: ନନ୍ଦି) is the name of the gate- guardian deity of Kailasa, the abode of Lord Shiva.

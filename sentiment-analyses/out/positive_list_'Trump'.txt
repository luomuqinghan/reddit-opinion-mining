'Because like attracts like.'
'Modi\'s motherland is Gujarat. India is a land of many cultures. This is a fact, and no mentally healthy person would deny it. Many Indian cultures eat beef and find the cow to be quite delicious and nutritious. No one is buying your nonsense.\n\nYour post history is hilarious. You know your friends on /r/the_donald would spit on your "subhuman" face if they had the chance to? Stop hating yourself, and learn to be ok with who you are.'
'But, "Trump Steaks are by far the best tasting, most flavorful beef youâ€™ve ever had. Truly in a league of their own."'
"So he means to say that its ok to butcher a cow if you've bought it. Checkmate gaurakshaks."
"I don't know about that but US don't have laws against cow slaughter like Indian states"
"This kinda mentality annexed the top left side of the country. \n\nNo mentally healthy person wouldn't believe that we live in an era of cultural strife (probably one of the greatest ever).    Like a war, it's being played out through many mediums ... media being the greatest this is why you've seen nationalism and populism exponentially growing. \n\nIndia is the central hub of Hinduism in the world, and of course they welcome and relatively cater to all religions ... There are many mosques, church's, temples, synagogues in India yet I don't see them being unreasonably bullied or exiled or disrespected ? Then respect the fucking country's culture. \n\n\nThere's a reason why India is one of the oldest surviving countries/civilizations/cultures on the earth,  its survived Persians, Alexander the Great, the mongols, the British colonial rule, separation of its land... it knows how to defend itself and it's people believe their doing it again now.

"Osama and 9/11 was one of the best things that happened to India's case against Pakistan. It is sad to see that it took an external process to further India's case."

'I think its up the people of US and India to realize and maintain relationships beyond corporate gain, jobs and tech stuff. Ideologically we are close, should not let anything break that.'

'any more documentaries like this ?'

'Still US needs Pakistan though. Pakistan shares a long border with both Iran and Afghanistan. Iran is gonna be at loggerheads with Saudi for the foreseeable future. US needs Pakistan.'

Plenty of media stalwarts in India who happily hobnobbed with Fai were suddenly left with eggs on their faces. He would host at least one conference every year in the US, to which Indian chatterati were duly invited. All expenses paid. Put up in nice hotels and taken to fancy breakfasts/lunches/dinners too. In return, they regularly presented him on the talk/lecture/media circuit as a "genuine voice of the Kashmiri people, etc. etc."\n\nNot one of these oiseaules thought to ask _where_ all this money came from. And now they want the public to believe that they had no idea what was really going on...'
"Economically, Pakistan isn't that much below India. If Pakistan had the same population as India, they would be one of the top 10 GDPs in the world."
"the government had clear proof, and provided it. Non-allies just saw no interest in pursuing it. It's kind of like the Blood Telegram really, if you don't want to believe it, proof is irrelevant or an obstruction."

"> Still those NRIs voted for Trump. Classic case of Apna Kaam Banta...bhaad mein jaaye junta\n\n.\n\n> Not NRI's. But ABCDs and naturalized citizens of Indian descent\n\n\nWell some Indian Origin Americans did, like how Latinos in Florida voted in larger than expected for Trump. The thing is people make it sound like the Indian diaspora fully supported Trump."
"Yeah I don't think that's true. I haven't seen voting statistics for Indian Americans specifically (they're a small group like you said, so don't really get news coverage in the US), but only know that there is a voting bloc that supported Trump."

Paul Manafort, a former presidential advisor and Donald Trump's campaign manager, was paid by the Pakistani Inter-Service Intelligence Agency (between 1990 and 1994) to spread lies and divert attention from terrorism in Kashmir.
'No wonder he makes frequent trips to japan, all that KOBE beef :D'
'[only indian cows are real cows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHPqepxbl7U&t=0m13s).\n\nSince american cows are not real cows, Modi did not hug a beef eater. ■'
'These hypocritical wretches are fine with everything as long as they are the ones doing it, or they get to commit violence against one group or another.'
'can\'t do here but i can give you a peak "*If Trump can fuck PissFool libtards , Modi ji too can*"'
">If Trump steals a poor farmers cow and butchers it thus breaking the law, he'll get the same treatment from Gau-rakshaks like anyone else.\n\nThis is one of the replies to the tweet. So there are people out there who not only compare humans with animals, but also defend murder. I think...*I think*...India is fucked."
"Defending itself by killing innocent people and forcing regressive ideology as part and parcel of Hinduism fuck off. Hinduism apne baap ki nahi hai, koi bhi aega aur culture syllabus likh ke jaega. The only reason Indian civilization as withstood time is because of its virtue of acceptance and not the new found hate. Enjoy the little transitional period that the bigots get for now. It'll all be over soon."
"I see this is a response you give whenever someone presents any logic that doesn't coincide with your propaganda. "

'What the hell did they pay him with? Goats?'
'Sad to say this but our government failed to address truths about kashmir internationally.'
'I recently read a news report about Manafort\'s daugter\'s leaked messages. She\'s been caught saying "the money we have is blood money" by hackers. He has killed people in Ukraine on behalf of Russian government and the payment is still due. These types of people do anything for money.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.in/Hacked-text-messages-allegedly-sent-by-Paul-Manaforts-daughter-discuss-blood-money-and-killings-and-a-Ukrainian-lawyer-wants-him-to-explain/articleshow/57761648.cms\n\nEdit: Have a look at this tweet also https://twitter.com/tanvi_madan/status/894589748215517184 This is a public figure with more than 22k followers, I hope mods won\'t remove it.

'Never trust U-essay '
"Manafort is an evil piece of shit, I can't wait to see him in jail."
'China further complicates things in Pakistan otherwise it would have no footing.'
"It can be argued that the war on terror had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan and paved the way for ISIS. While India still isn't directly in their line of fire, I can't really bring myself to see any of this as a good thing.\n\nAmerica's attitudes towards Pakistan have barely changed after the cold war and what's even more worrying is a looming China-Russia-Pakistan friendship."
"That was the best thing to happen to Pakistan. They were deep in debt around that time. Amreeka needed them to attack Taliban, so they poured billions in Pakistan, got them out of debt and US troop presence in Pakistan meant that India couldn't attack even if Pakistani troops prodded us.\n\nAt least that's how I remember it."
'There are no friends. There are no enemies. There are interests.'

"Stone is very likeable. I didn't know how I felt about him until I saw that he fucked with Ted Cruz."
'I\'d suggest changing the questions to "would the game be dirty, if there weren\'t dirty men?" Hard to blame a "game" when it\'s created and played by people with very little regard to morality and ethical outcomes for society.\n\nThe documentary was fantastic, but I think the mentality of "don\'t hate the player, hate the game" is used by those people who need a semblance of human decency to maintain their sanity when they start to realize they are among the worst of sociopaths.'
'“Don’t fight in the North or the South. Fight every battle everywhere, always, in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend. Every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you’ve seen before.”'
"USA wants a bitch. Pakistan was, but India can't be. We can be allies but we won't allow as much influence as Pakistan did. "
'> The USA is first and foremost a colonial project\n\nOh my! You do know who they fought against for independence, right? The colonial appetite for the US came much later, after their civil war. Though one could argue that the southern plantations were effectively a colony, with a large portion of population being literal slaves.'
'How did you manage to get the plural form right for ABCDs but wrong for NRIs?'
'did you forget about the native Americans?'

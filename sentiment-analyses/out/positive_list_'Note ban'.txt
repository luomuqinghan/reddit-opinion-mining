"The difference here is that this party with a difference is full of small time crooks who have made it too big too quicky, and can't control their greed. 60 years of congress corruption has to be surpassed in 5 years. Takes commitment and boneheadedness."
"Does anyone think this whole Jay Shah affair is not a coincidence.\n\nI bet people were sitting on this evidence for a long time. They released it at the perfect time before Gujarat election time. People can digest this.\n\nEven UPA scams that were done mostly in UPA-1 were released in UPA-2 and they lost.\n\nIf congress wins gujarat there would be shockwaves. If it doesn't the decline of congress may be too hard to stop. There is a lot riding on the gujarat election."

"Yes that's because they would be Lankeshed"
'Small time crooks? They just conducted the largest money laundering scheme in this country\'s history and convinced the majority of the people that it\'s good for them. Congress should take notes from them how to legalize and "nationalize" corruption.'
'As if Congress were better. Still people should give BJP a strong punch in the face which will make them realize people are much more intelligent than they thought. '

"Congress did a good comeback in Goa, Assam, Punjab state elections. But BJP came in to power by buying the MLA's. So public opinion is shifting back towards Congress. But BJP's biggest bet is on UP from where it can polarise to get 80 mps that makes it win half the battle. Congress should catch up by 2019 general elections! Lately I have seen Newspapers to be less populated by BJP trolls and FB posts top comments to be against right wing. I am seeing a shift in tide currently. "

'AND.............BOOM! \n\nBJP will still call it a successful one. Amit Shah will still spew shit like India has changed because of such insightful decision of our very own UNESCO award winner PM Mudi. Poor common people who are struggling to keep food on dinner table, parents struggling to keep their kids in schools... are perfect guinea pig for our enlightened political class. Keep doing such great job, India'
"Reposting my reply from another thread here.\n\nWhy is everyone making the assumption that since 99% came back into the system the whole exercise was a failure.\n\n If 90% came back into the system or 105% came back that would have been a surprise.  99% is bit on expected lines isn't it? Just because the money is deposited in the banks does not mean the exercise stops! There is an obvious trail of who deposited how much, when, where, into what accounts etc. The government has all this data with it. All it has to do is to know all the suspicious transactions to get a better picture. Performing data analytics on this large chunk of data should not be too complicated I believe.\n\nThis assumption that since all this black money came back into the system so some how all the black money holders are now safe is ludicrous!\n\nYou really did not expect the black money holders wouldn't put their money in the bank and just let it burn or rot away :) they would have tried all possible means to get it in, only that they kind of outed themselves while doing it. "
"Maybe its just me but it seems to me like even if the unrecovered amount (which is the supposed black money) is only around 1%, it's one percent of a huge amount and comes up to 9k crores. That's amount seems huge to me. If this money goes back into circulation, won't it benefit the economy in any way?\n"
'Just like minority appeasement was good ROI for Congress. \n\nEconomy be dammed. '
'They might actually rub it in how it was really a successful political move to uproot the remainder of the secular polity.'
'good point.'
'> Just because the money is deposited in the banks does not mean the exercise stops! There is an obvious trail of who deposited how much, when, where, into what accounts etc. \n\nYes, people hoarding black money would be foolish enough to deposit their black money into their own accounts so the govt could catch them. They would do that instead of using the several other options at their disposal like using mules, or dealing with brokers who would exchange old notes for a price, or laundering the money via "donations" to political parties. \n\n\n> Performing data analytics on this large chunk of data should not be too complicated I believe.\n\nWell, aggregating over the records of deposits made shouldn\'t have taken 8 months either, but the RBI still took that much time. \n\nAnd the notion that this govt (or any other) cares about ending black money is laughable. This govt has vehemently opposed RTI on political parties, they\'ve watered down the whistleblower bill, they\'ve allowed witnesses to be killed vyapam style and they want political donations to be anonymous. Seriously, this is how black money will be fought, by making parties a great funnel for black money?'
"> 99% is bit on expected lines isn't it? \n\nthis is a straight up lie. the government said that around 30% of the money won't come back. but then they shifted the goal posts and it seems you have forgotten about it. please read up on the facts of what the government claimed before sucking up to their defence"
"nope. it could still be black money, money on which taxes have not been paid.\n\nfor example : you say you are low income, and either not file taxes or file it with low income. but you deposited 2 crore into your account during demonetization. the tax guys will come and ask where this money came from. \n\nas long as they don't have reply, this money is classified as black. it might not be, but it is so classified.\n\nyou may have legit reason for deposit. \n\nas of now, the government is going to HAVE to show/talk something positive, otherwise they cannot convince the sceptics, whose votes they might need in the future.\n\nit will be a mixed bag, and will take some time, say 2 years, to clear out Just in time for the next election, a miracle.\n\n:)"
"Few months before demonetization the government was running an income declaration scheme asking people to declare their ill-gotten wealth. Over 60k people declared it to the tune of 65k crores. Pretty sure these people weren't foolish. \n\nThink about it, being a black money hoarder, ignoring the income declaration scheme thinking it won't effect you since you have always gotten away with it and then suddenly faced with the realization of demonetization. They would be shitting bricks wondering what to do with their wealth. Won't surprise me that lots of people would indeed deposit their money in the bank in the hope that the government will forgive their belated attempt on declaring their wealth.\n\nSure people would have used other options to convert their money (gold being another thing you can add to your list) but i feel the volume of money washed this way would be much less that what people make it out to be.\n\nI don't think the RBI will get itself into the game of catching people with black money. That will be tasked to the investigation agencies (ED, IT etc).\n\nI haven't read/heard anywhere of large scale black money used in political funding. Pretty sure there is black money involved but the volume would be far less I think."
"Wouldn't NOTA get us a hung government like in the 90s? Seems like people have forgotten Gujarat, VP Singh, Chandrasekhar etc... "

Pretty sure there is black money involved but the volume would be far less I think.\n\nHaha. So cute. "
"> Over 60k people declared it to the tune of 65k crores. Pretty sure these people weren't foolish. \n\nApples and orangutans. The IDS exempted the declarers from legal action. Depositing money during DeMo didn't, in fact the stated goal was to catch people depositing money beyond their known sources of income. You'd have to be exceptionally thick to knowingly deposit unaccountable money into your own account. \n\n\n> They would be shitting bricks wondering what to do with their wealth.\n\nOr, you know, using any of the umpteen methods that were available. There were do many methods that even the media was reporting on, there were in all probability quite a few more that they weren't aware of too.\n\nIn the worst case, even if they couldn't use any of those avenues, they still had the option of destroying the cash. That would reduce their net worth but it would also avoid getting caught. You're asserting that they ignored all these obvious options and chose to show the govt that they had black money after the govt explicitly stated that black money holders would get punished. Just how thick do you think the black money holders are? \n\nAlso, if what you just said is true, think about the obvious implications: almost all the black money hoarders had faith that the govt would be lenient with them (which is why only 1% didn't come back) and that's why they deposited the money. Why would black money hoarders gave such complete faith in the govt's sympathy if the govt was so serious about ending black money?\n\n\n\n> but i feel the volume of money washed this way would be much less that what people make it out to be.\n\nDo you have any data to back up those feelings? I'm not sure how much I can trust your jedi instincts. \n\n\n> I haven't read/heard anywhere of large scale black money used in political funding\n\nYes, because political parties (who run the govt) have all the incentive in the world to reveal information about how much they are financed by black money. And they don't have the means to prevent you from finding out. After all, political funding worldwide is known as one of the most straightforward, least corrupt and susceptible to moral hazard activities possible. \n\nBut let's think through your assertion for a minute. You think this third world country has a massive problem of black money and corruption, but you think political funding, an area where unscrupulous businessmen (ie black money holders) can invest to further their own interests, is largely immune to the influx of black money? Seriously, black money hoarders would not see the obvious benefits of buying up political parties, something even legit businessmen in the first world see the value of doing, despite the fact that political connections are much more valuable to a black money hoarder? \n\nIf you're willing to believe that, then I think I've just seen the target audience for the Nigerian prince email scams.

'**Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme**\n\nThe Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme (VDIS) was a very unconventional but successful step among Indian economic policies. It would give an opportunity to the income tax or wealth tax defaulters to disclose their undisclosed income at the prevailing tax rates. This scheme would also ensure that the laws relating to economic offences would not be applicable for those defaulters. Over 350,000 people disclosed their income and assets under this scheme, which brought a revenue of ₹78 billion (US$1.2 billion) to the Indian finance ministry.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'

"Ok so between 1951 to 1997 60k crore was collected from VDIS and 65k crore in 2016 alone from IDS. Great figures and I hope more of this happens.\n\nSo the unknown sources for political funding add up to 5k crores over the period of 10 years with Congress having the majority share of unknown funds.  Quite a large number for sure and something that definitely should be reformed - but - in the context of this thread still quite a small figure to hold up to the assertion made earlier that large part of black money from demonetization drive was ending up in political funding. Looks like it's not. Maybe hundreds of crores but not ten's of thousands or lakhs of crores of rupees ending into political funding as it is made out to be."
"\n>Ok so between 1951 to 1997 60k crore was collected from VDIS and 65k crore in 2016 alone from IDS.\n\nReading comprehension failure? \n\nFrom the article:\n>One of them was the Voluntary Disclosure Scheme, 1997, which had been introduced for a compliance period of six months. Under VDIS,\xa0\xa0the tax payable on the declared amount was at the rate of 35 per cent in case of companies and firms, and 30 percent in the case of others.\xa0The income declared under VDIS had been\xa0Rs 33,000 crore.\xa0\n\n>Reports suggested that the fair value of the declarations under the scheme\xa0would have\xa0been over Rs 60,000 crore, rather than the Rs 33,000 crore that was actually declared. That\xa0scheme attracted 4.75 lakh declarations. Almost\xa03.09 lakh pertained to jewellery and other movable assets.\n\n\nPolitical funding: Yes, because political parties have all the incentive in the world to declare all their funding. The amount in the linked article is only that which is declared by them. There are many expenses and incomes which aren't even declared. Like the cash or other gifts given to voters."

'Actually every religion has that kind of hardcore adherents. For example cow vigilantes here. \n\nBut in Islam this kind of conservative radicalism is something that becomes mainstream in a way not seen in other religions. For example how nearly all organised Muslim bodies in India unanimously support sharia derived personal laws, see homosexuality as sodomy, bitterly oppose any blasphemy against their Prophet etc.\n\nEven in Christianity you can have cases like the Pope making public statements supporting homosexuality and even accepting gay pastors. But can this happen in mainstream Islam?'

'Sure we shit on India but there is also a scintilla of fear.\n\nFear of not exactly being murdered but beaten up because you publicly claim to be an atheist.\n\nFear of repercussions when you refuse to stand in a movie hall during the national anthem.\n\nFear of being targetted if you write a lot questioning the Government and people in authority.\n\nFear of actually being caught with beef by a group of folks from certain nationalist organisations.\n\nFear of opening the doors to cops because you liked something or commented on something, online.\n\nMost of r/India are based in major cities in India and abroad and assume its safe, burying this gnawing thought at the back of our head that it does not take much for you to finally face similar backlash and at that point you have no power, influence or financial resources to protect you, when it does.

"It's got much more to do with the acceptance of atheism in society than the population of atheists.

"Only because people don't know that they need protein, or what it even is. But that is only partially true, mostly it is because people only have enough money to eat cheap food like rice and wheat. Vegetarians and even vegans can easily get plenty of protein, but need a diverse diet to stay healthy (so do non vegetarians, eating meat is not going to save malnutrition). Milk and cheese are very popular for a reason."
"Every single national dietetic association agrees that a vegan diet (not just vegetarian) is healthy and suitable for humans in all stages of the life cycle. \n\nIn fact, if you look at the largest state economies of India, many are in the states where prevalence of vegetarianism is highest, including, for example, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Punjab. The point isn't to suggest that the causal factor is vegetarianism, but that abstaining from meat consumption is not a debilitating disease. "
'A balanced diet conducive to childhood growth and long-term health, as defined by the World Health Organisation. A lack of even one nutrient or mineral will result in that child being defined as malnourished. Keep in mind that even many developed countries are down at about 50% by this measure. A major problem in India is that we don\'t implement basic measures that you see in other poor countries, like the widespread use of iodised salt. I\'ve been told that our dairy, poultry and fishery industries are very unproductive as well, which further drives up cost (no sources for this though), and a *huge* proportion of our food ends up rotting before it gets to market due to low-tech storage practices and an extremely inefficient route from farm to market. So even people who eat three meals a day are often avoiding things that they should be eating.\n\nI suspect that the difference between North and South India is due to three main factors. The most obvious one is the fact that the poverty rate in the South is significantly lower than in the North - but that doesn\'t explain Delhi, which is one of the wealthiest regions. The second reason is that South Indians are much less vegetarian than North Indians, so it\'s easier to get a balanced diet. The third is that the southern states have implemented a large number of "Socialist" schemes like midday meals, subsidised food, heavily subsidised eateries (Amma\' Kitchen), etc., that make it much easier for the poor to eat good meals.\n\nIt has been estimated that you would need to spend approximately Rs. 200 a day for a balanced diet in India, and this is well above what most Indians earn. The Planning Commission got around this by defining "poverty" as an income less that Rs. 33/day. This is the figure used in most states and territories like Delhi for the allocation of subsidies, so you can see where the problem lies. While we consider Delhi to be wealthy, the truth is that most people are earning far less than what can be used to buy adequate food, but earn a bit too much to qualify for Government help or factor into Government subsidy calculations. And this Rs. 33 is for total income, not income spent on food. Many homeless in Delhi who spend all their income on barely surviving are not classified as poor by Planning Commission standards, which is ridiculous.\n\nThis is why the midday meals program, Amma Unavagam, and other such schemes in TN were so important - because they applied to *everybody* who needed it irrespective of whether they earned below or above the paltry Government-defined poverty line. All kids at Government primary schools are eligible for a free meal (sometimes two depending on the school I believe), and workers can get a good sanitary meal for Rs. 5 at an Amma\'s kitchen restaurant. These universal centralised (at State level) schemes also address inequalities across gender, religious and caste lines, as none of these things matter when everyone receives the same treatment from the State Government. Until such schemes are widely introduced across the county at an *equal or greater* quality of implementation as in TN, even places like Delhi will continue to suffer from these problems at the extent to which you see here.'
'Yes indeed. It is a great reason(and scheme). I just realized that my comment sounds a bit whiny but I was praising the scheme there. \n'
"I didn't talk about the other political parties in my comment at all. That's a whole different story which I'll explain shortly. All my comment says is that  K.Kamaraj developed a mid-day meal scheme that has now been adopted throughout the country. I can't see how you jumped to a ridiculous conclusion. Typical randian mindset i guess.\n\nAnyway, I would also ask you to look into the history properly before commenting in the future. K.Kamaraj introduced Mid-day meal scheme in Chennai and seeing it is a huge success, expanded it to all the districts. It was a huge success and well-received among the public. People were well-informed on who introduced this scheme and how good this is. Period.\n\nThen MGR comes to power and modifies the mid-day meal scheme into a 'nutritious meal scheme' by adding more protein (an egg) to the scheme. So technically mid-day meal scheme belonged to K.Kamarajar if you look at it this way. But I will accept that none of the political parties which came to power so far has scraped this scheme(knowing it will be a sole reason for their electoral loss, not because they are honest do-good ppl).

'Yes, and even if religious sensibilities were taken into account, mutton could be provided in place of beef. Malnourished children will not grow up to be productive and innovative contributors to the economy. '

A lack of even one nutrient or mineral will result in that child being defined as malnourished. Keep in mind that even many developed countries are down at about 50% by this measure.\n\nFrom what I have looked into the NFHS's definition, it looks like anyone who doesn't eat meat daily would qualify as malnourished in their definition. Of course by that definition 95% of Indians will be malnourished. You have to take care of cultural factors before coming up with definitions. "
"You're belittling MGR's contribution and overstating Kamaraj's contribution. \n\nKamaraj's made it a public policy for only rural schools. And the funds were to come from the local governments. Considering how poor the local govts were, the fund allocation for the scheme by 1982 was a mere 6 crores. MGR made it a state govt scheme and expanded it to all the govt schools and added child care centers (2-5 year old kids) to it. The allocation raised to 150-200 crores within 1 year. That single move increased school enrollment by 70% and reduced drop outs by 90%. While Kamaraj has to be credited for making it a govt policy(even if limited), it is MGR who takes the credit for making the policy work. "
'Of course. A balanced diet is required for any type of diet. You can eat meat and still be very malnourished. Look at TN, only 31% of children are nourished in a state with 98% omnivores. Surely I can pull up other examples. Plenty of Somalis eat meat but are malnourished. '

'Its just an observation, plenty of threads on this sub usually have calling out of Indians in general (on randia). Usually highly upvoted. We don\'t mind criticism as a larger collective from individuals in that collective. For instance, on a normal reddit thread, if someone said "humans are doomed", people won\'t be offended, they might present polite counterarguments. But if they said "Indians are doomed", we\'d assume that person is not an Indian and get offended. Same here, if the comment said Indians are the biggest hypocrites, people on the sub would have upvoted it but since it targets a smaller collective and you being a part of that collective do not take it well. I am not saying you are offended but yeah, clearly you don\'t like the comment and therefore a humorous rebuttal. I don\'t know what I am rambling. '

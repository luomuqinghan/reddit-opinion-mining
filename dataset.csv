Amazon Prime video is censoring content and the world needs to take notice,that_70_show_fan,1482897365.0,1121,Entertainment,self.india,"'First of all, this is only case where I found that Amazon Prime is censoring their content. If they are doing the same in other countries please let me know in the comments. \n\nIndia has severe restrictions on what can be showed on TV and what cannot, but rather than the state directly censoring... the TV channels censor their own content. [We have had instances where a channel has been taken off air for showing the wrong map of India.](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Al-Jazeera-taken-off-air-for-five-days-for-showing-wrong-India-map/articleshow/47015509.cms) These TV channels take this the extreme, like censoring the word ""beef,"" blurring visuals of beef in cooking shows, blurring visuals of lingerie, etc. \n\nAmazon has implemented this tactic to online streaming content despite India having no laws censoring online videos(aside from child porn). [The government of India has publicly stated that they have no intention of censoring online videos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5i2fi0/ib_ministry_we_are_not_considering_censorship_of/)  \n\nIn response to criticism of censoring their content, Amazon response is:\n\n> ""We will keep Indian cultural sensitivities in mind while offering this content to customers""\n\nThey completely censored an entire segment from Ep 4 of *The Grand Tour* as it showed the carcass of a cow. The runtime of this episode is 30 minutes as opposed to the original 62 minutes. In addition to that they have blurred any instances of nudity. \n\nThey are setting an extremely dangerous precedent by being a willing participant in censoring content. This is the wet dream of the government of India and other countries where the state wants censorship but do not have the resources to implement it on their own. [This comes at a time when Holloywood is bending over backwards to appease the Chinese censor board\\(SAPPRFT\\)](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/05/18/407619652/how-chinas-censors-influence-hollywood).     \n\nAs someone who is involved in fighting against censorship, this is a serious blow as I see the rest of the industry following suit. \n\nIndia is still a small market for Amazon, but it needs to know that there are many who oppose any form of censorship by principle. I hope people in the west notice how their companies behave if they see potential to make some extra money. \n\n'",5ko5tu

"PSA : Freecharge can block your account for ""security reasons"" without giving any explanation. There is no way to unblock your account and use your money. Account of users with a rooted android phone seems to be a common element. Avoid freecharge at all cost.",hfsyou,1480145655.0,1018,Non-Political,self.india,"'I had around RS. 300 in my freecharge account as of 24 November, 2016.\n\n  On 24 November me and 3 other redditors from r/IndianGaming decided to buy 4-pack Rocket league PC game from Steam sale. Here is the thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/5elbao/anyone_interested_in_buying_rocket_league/\nIt costed Rs. 180 for each of us.\n\n  I sent them the game as a gift on steam and they sent me RS.180 via freecharge. It was all good and happy. Now total balance around Rs. 650.\n\n  On November 25, when I try to access my freecharge account via my android phone, it shows a notification saying your account has been ""temporarily banned"" and for further information contact ""care@freecharge.com"". I go ahead and email them asking for the reason for why it was banned and to unblock it asap.\n\n  Today, 26 November, I receive a mail saying - \n  >Dear XYZ,\n\n>Thank you for writing in.\n\n>We understand that you are unable to use the FreeCharge account. \n\n>As per our records account has been blocked due to security reasons & cannot be unblocked further. \n\n\n>However, if you have any general balance in your FreeCharge wallet, the same would be refunded to the same source (Sender\'s account) which was used to load money into your Freecharge account. \n\n>Refund amount will reflect in your source (bank account/card) within 7 to 10 working days as per bank norms.\n\n>Do write to us for any further queries.\n\n>Happy FreeCharging,\n>Customer Success Team\n\n\n  Wow, brilliant. I\'m not even sure what half of it means. Will the freecharge account of redditors from r/IndianGaming receive a refund for Rs. 180? Or will their bank/CC receive it.\n\n  Now the initial Rs. 300 I had was a part of RS. 500 that was sent to me by my friend ABC who had added money to his wallet from his friend PQR who had a credit card. I don\'t have one. I had transferred some part of 500 to my brother\'s account, where he used a part of it and returned back the other part.\n\nNow I\'m not sure If my friend ABC will receive a refund or will his friend PQR will receive the refund. Don\'t even know if either of them will receive a refund.\n\n  Being angry af, I started searching for similar issues on google. Many people have faced the same problem of their account being banned and no reason being given to them. \n\n   After some more research, I found that rooted phone was a common theme. I\'m not sure if this is the exact reason or not. But somewhere a person who created a second account on his rooted dual sim phone (After his first account was banned) had his new account blocked in seconds. My OnePlus 2 has been rooted from day 1. I\'ve had freecharge installed since 3 months now. Also how does my phone being rooted matter?\n\n  Lastly, Snapdeal bought Freecharge for $400 million. That amount of money and you don\'t have a f*cking toll free number. Forget toll free number, at least a normal number where I can call them. Or at least live chat. They reply to emails every 24 hour. \n\n  Now even If I get all of my money back, this is some next level of shit and I\'m never using freecharge again. Also, If I don\'t, is there something I can do about it? Experienced redditors, help me pls file a consumer complain against them.\n\n\n**Freecharge, fuck you! Also, as many redditors have pointed out, freecharge usually has shitty customer service and my case is not an exception.**\n\n\n\n  **Also remember to share this with people who have ROOTED android phones and have started using freecharge after demonetisation.**\n\n**EDIT**: Other threads calling out snapdeal/freecharge for fraud:\n\n\n1. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4z1viu/freecharge_wallet_scam/\n2. https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/59c8ky/np_the_snapdeal_quality_check_scam/\n\n**EDIT 2**: Just found out about a loophole where one can login into a freecharge account without being needed to enter the OTP. Now, I\'m no cyber security expert, but it seems like by installing an old Freecharge apk from one of these sites, you don\'t need to enter the otp.\n\n  This is ridiculous. This [site](http://www.jonomus.net/coupon/freecharge-trick-earn-unlimted-recharge/]) explains how simple it is. Okay, I\'m not getting everything about it but there are about 100 sites like this. WTF $400 million freecharge is doing about this? Is this a joke?\n\n**EDIT 3**: Damn, this blew up. Number of upvotes on this post is more than my loss. Some relief lol.\n\n**EDIT 4**: Seems like many redditors were also banned for unknown reasons and their queries were never answered. Freecharge twitter/facebook has not replied to me yet. I haven\'t even received a reply to my email sent 10 hours ago. They really do reply only once in 24 hours. I still can\'t comprehend this.\n\n**EDIT 5**:Great news, both u/rebelsoul94 and u/not_the_irrelevant have confirmed they\'ve re received the refund in their accounts, though without any notifications. They\'ll send it to me again later in  another account, which I will use in 34 milliseconds.  **Still no idea about the other Rs. 300**. Neither my friend ABC nor his friend PQR have received any refund. '",5eyfsg

Oxford student harassed by Indians on Quora for being able to solve the JEE Advance question paper,thelonesomeguy,1499858157.0,976,Non-Political,self.india,"""*Edit: I would like to clarify that I'm not Jack Fraser, considering that many people were getting confused. I rather posted his Quora answer here, the link to which is at the bottom of the post.*\n\nThis was a particularly unpleasant thing that happened to me a few weeks back.\n\nSomeone asked a question in the topic\xa0[Jack Fraser (Quora user)](https://www.quora.com/topic/Jack-Fraser-Quora-user), which went something along the lines of\n\n“Can Jack Fraser solve the JEE paper?”\n\n(For those of you who don’t know, the JEE is an Indian physical sciences admissions paper for their universities - some people take it\xa0**_really_**\xa0seriously, a fact I didn’t know at the time!)\n\nI thought it would be a laugh to sit down and do the paper, and see how I did.\n\nThere were two papers, about 80 multiple choice questions each.\n\nNow.\n\nThis is where I made my mistake.\n\n**I told them how I breezed through it.\xa0**I did it in about a third of the allowed time, and with 100% correct answers.\n\n* * *\n\n**BIG mistake.**\n\n* * *\n\nNow, first of all I think I need to make some qualifications:\n\n- I am a third year physics student\n- This is a high school-level paper, taken by ~17 year olds\xa0_who haven’t spent 3 years at university studying physics_\n- I have been sitting physics exams every year for nigh-on 7 years now\n- Multiple choice makes exams\xa0**immeasurably**\xa0easier\n\nAs I explained in\xa0[this answer here](https://www.quora.com/Jack-Fraser-dominates-all-basic-physics-I-mean-can-he-easily-respond-to-any-problem-in-basic-physics-books/answer/Jack-Fraser-11), it thus comes as no surprise that I found a test designed for people much less educated in physics than me pretty easy.\n\nIt’s nothing special - nobody is surprised when a 6 year old can walk, and a baby\xa0_can’t_.\n\nIt would be significantly\xa0_more_\xa0worrying if £27,000 being spent on 3 years at one of the best universities on this planet didn’t prepare me to ace an\xa0_admissions test for another university!_\n\n* * *\n\nNow - I explained all of this in my answer, in painstaking detail.\n\n…\n\n…\n\nIt didn’t go down well.\n\nI was called a liar. Insults were thrown.\n\nOne guy called me scum.\n\nI was told there was simply no way a simpleton like me could do well on this — it is simply the hardest exam to ever grace the face of this planet.\n\n* * *\n\nThis stuff was pretty mild — and Quora took care of the abuse well enough that I had no complaints.\n\nBut then some people took the issue\xa0_off_\xa0Quora. They found my Facebook.\n\nThey found my\xa0**_family’s Facebook_**_._\n\nMy mother got some\xa0**_graphic\xa0_**pictures of male genitalia. My brother got sent threats. My Facebook profile picture was reported for ‘graphic indecency’ a few times, and I had a flood of abusive message appearing in my “Message Request” box. One guy sent me a picture of my (old) university accommodation, saying they knew where I lived*, and that he was going to “shiv” me.\n\nIt was really rather traumatic.\n\nI deleted the answer, and a few days later the entire question was deleted by Moderation.\n\nI don’t know if it was one guy using dozens of accounts (they were all fake profiles), or a cabal of several people,but eventually it petered out.\n\nFacebook (slowly) dealt with it, and the stuff went away.\n\nMy Mum still refers to it as “The time that guy had such low self esteem that he considered me seeing his penis to be the worst insult imaginable”.\n\nSo it’s not so much that the response was\xa0_on_\xa0Quora — indeed, the problem was that it escalated beyond the bounds of Quora.\n\nI’m not going to answer any more questions about the JEE. It seems like it’s a bit too touchy a subject!\n\n* * *\n\n* This would have been more threatening if it wasn’t the top result when you google\xa0[trinity college oxford](https://www.google.co.uk/search?bih=590&biw=1280&q=trinity+college+oxford&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB703GB703&sa=X&source=lnms&tbm=isch&ved=0ahUKEwjgvLzf_LjSAhWqD8AKHXK0BFAQ_AUICCgB). And if I still lived there, which I don’t.\n\n* * *\n\nPS. To the hundreds of people flooding to the comments section and my inbox to apologise for these people and assert that it's not all Indians - no need.\n\nI am in fact madly in love with one of your countrywomen, and am perfectly aware that this is a small, idiotic minority. There is no need to fret that I am tarring all Indians with the same brush!\n\nEdit: Link to the answer https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-worst-response-you-have-received-on-Quora/answer/Jack-Fraser-11?timeline=1""",6mt9hv

"Two weeks after Amazon Prime Video launches its censored catalogue in India, Netflix India releases two films that the censor board refused to certify; and releases uncensored versions of films that are on the Prime Video catalogue [np]",shadowbannedguy1,1483246070.0,966,Non-Political,self.india,"'*Watchmen*, *Top Gun*, and *The Godfather* are now on Netflix as well as Amazon Prime Video; but Prime Video has these titles censored -- blurred nudity and the like.\n\n*Udta Punjab* and *Saheb Bibi Golaam*, both of which were refused CBFC certificates and had to get certified by the Bombay High Court and the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal respectively.\n\n# ""**But but but Amazon has Indian operations so they should be more careful because sentiments and laws and stuff!**""\n\nIncorrect. Just because Netflix doesn\'t have an office in India doesn\'t mean that they don\'t comply with Indian laws. Netflix is paying India\'s 15% digital tax, one of the only few territories where it has to do so -- and it has been doing this since day 1 of the tax being required. Even Google and Steam haven\'t started charging this tax.\n\nNo sentiments have been hurt by Netflix, which has been in India for over a year without censorship -- several titles include gratuitous nudity and swear words. Many of these titles are Indian, a few that the censor board wouldn\'t even pass with a million cuts.\n\nThere is no law requiring online censorship, and the Ministry of Information &amp;amp;amp; Broadcasting has stated that they have no plans to create a regulatory framework to censor content on the Internet.\n\n# ""**But but but Hotstar is being sued for soft porn and stuff!**""\n\nAnd they\'ll win the case. There is no soft porn on Hotstar. *Game of Thrones* and *The Wire* do not count as soft porn, regardless of the nudity they have -- not to mention the million disclaimers and age warnings that one has to face before being allowed to access the content. Besides, the case is politically motivated and the judge has called the petitioners out for harassing the plaintiffs, but that\'s another story altogether.\n\n---\n\nNetflix doesn\'t censor because they know they don\'t need to -- they pay taxes to the Indian government but they don\'t care about ruining their catalogue for laws that don\'t exist. Prime Video, on the other hand, is led by an exec who used to work for a GEC, and brought in the GEC mentality to the company with him, which is leading him to do absurd stuff like cut out an entire segment of a TV show episode just because it contains a car that is made out of a bovine skeleton.\n\nIndians are way more accepting of such content than we give them credit for. Especially with online films and TV shows, every title displays the age rating and the kind of content a viewer can expect. A chilling effect that results from a backward perception of our own people is not a valid excuse to justify self-censorship, or write it off because they\'re ""just a business and have no obligation to stand up in favour of liberty"". Uhh, that would be standing up how, exactly? There is literally no legal or social ~~fallout to~~ reason for censorship of Prime -- they\'re ducking when nobody\'s throwing anything.\n\nAmazon\'s behaviour is not just overtly cautious, it\'s stupid and unnecessary. And we need to drive this point home until they wake up and fix their content.\n\nEdit: grammar'",5ldliu

"2 years working for an Indian tech firm taught me a lot, both about Indians and about myself.",SquatchHugs,1488465000.0,911,Non-Political,self.india,"""Hey there /r/India. I'm an American who, several years ago, happened (quite by chance) to find myself working for an Indian tech firm. I was hired by a US company to do some general office work, but was quickly picked up by the Indian firm and worked on contract for two years. In that time I was immersed in the generosity, thoughtfulness, and compassion that I've found to be a common thread among many Indians I've met through my life.\n\nMy role in the company wasn't terribly important, but I was generally the first non-Indian point of contact for the newly-hired and recently-transferred. Many of the other Americans I worked with were resentful of the foreign labor and were either passive aggressive about it or actively aggressive (they went so far as to bring a case to the US government claiming their jobs were stolen by immigrants). I tried my best to ensure our people's first impression was more positive, and treated everyone as respectfully as I would like to be treated.\n\nIt paid off! I was quickly accepted as not only a co-worker, but as a friend. I attended barbeques and work-functions regularly, learned about Indian religion, culture, and philosophy, and shared some delicious community lunches (once a week everyone brought something, and everyone shared). The earnestness with which my co-workers asked about my marriage, my plans, my happiness, never ceased to amaze me.\n\nThe experience left me wanting to be a more attentive member of my community, whatever that community is. I am not naive enough to lump every Indian into the same category and assume that my good experiences can be transposed on others, however it struck me that the differences were more cultural than anything.\n\nFor instance, Indians I have met tend to be vastly more empathetic than Americans. American culture is extraordinarily self-centered, and as a result empathy is largely stunted or absent in most individuals. At my company, however, the Indians I worked with formed a small community of their own and really seemed to care for the well-being of everyone involved.\n\nAnother point I've noticed has been a much stronger emphasis on family among Indians. As Americans we are taught that we make or break it on our own. This is starting to change as the economic market has more and more young adults living at home still, but it is generally seen as shameful to still rely on or live with parents at any age past 18. The only thing more shameful is to be an adult who relies on their children. However family was by far the biggest motivation for most of my co-workers to be working abroad, or even to have gone into the tech industry - they wanted a successful job so they could care for their wives and husbands, children and parents. It was wonderful, and has led to me having a much better relationship with my own family as a result, which in turn has made me a more loving and thoughtful person in general.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to point out is the difference in Indian patriotism when compared to Americans. Today, American patriotism revolves around the idea of superiority, whether through morality, wealth, or force. Americans simply like to be better than other people. The founders of our country are revered today not because of their teachings, but because they are seen as having fought tyranny and won. When my Indian colleagues spoke of India, they spoke of its great thinkers and leaders and of their religion, not for their accomplishments, but for how they taught India new ways to think.\n\nI have never been to India, and it's possible I never will, but I have been fortunate enough to see a small piece of India that some of my friends brought with them to America. I'm deeply troubled by recent events, not only referring to the recent shooting of two Indians here, but to the social climate as a whole. Our country is made weaker by the intolerance and ignorance of its leaders and lawmakers, and I'm saddened that so many people cannot see anything but their own fears.\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as preachy or condescending - I work nights so I've been piecing this together on my downtime, and my only intent is to share my perspective. Stay safe, and thanks for reading.""",5x3ht0

Their template answer is ""Sir/Madam, we got it from our database""\n\nReply to them ""Thank you for your call and for sharing your full details with me. You are now on my database.

Place is full of rapists and weirdos. Nithari happened here. Tyagi case happened here.   \n3. Garbage. Heaps of it on roadside. Every 500 meters. Stinky. Herds of Pigs and cows. Pigs have bred, there used to be 3 now there\'s 15 around every garbage heap.   \n4. People drive on the wrong side. *They* give you the stares as they pass you.  \n5. 90% Noidaites are like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuwaydZD-Kg) SP blob. I\'m not kidding, everyone I\'ve met is like this on some level, or considers this a life goal. Young or old. In Marutis or BMWs. They may look ""sabhya"", pander a lot, talk very sweetly, but deep down - they are inconsiderate entitled scum. It\'s a cultural thing here.   \n6.  \n7.  \n...  \n\nThe list is long. Point being - DO NOT ever come to Noida. I am telling you. I know that residents of every locality have complaints, even if they live in plush spots like California. And I\'ve factored that sort of bias in my post here.   \n\nNoida is the absolute bottom of the barrel. Rest of India (excl. bimaru) will seem like America once you see Noida.  \n\nNoida is the land of low lives and squalor. Whole place needs to be nuked.    \n____________________________\n\n**Edit 1138 PM** This post blew up more than I anticipated! Hope everyone had some takeaways from it. Stay clear of Noida everyone, as much as possible. No self respecting person should be living in this gonorrhea of a town.   \n\n* If you are young and looking at a new job, beg your recruiting manager for a Bangalore/Hyderabad/Mumbai/Chennai posting. Say you have asthma problems, fake medical reports if needed. Do whatever it takes to stay clear of Noida, and Delhi NCR in general. Leave aside the pollution and traffic; living in a place with horrible people will have terrible effects on you. And God forbid if you\'re still impressionable at 22, the people here will turn you into a criminal or rapist or a weirdo.     \n\n* If you are a family person and you get a posting here, you are bound to be financially stable by your age. Which means you can control where you live and how you shield yourself. This is how my family lives - we live in fear and we don\'t venture too far from our little gated community. Our houses are secure like Walking Dead. We still never feel secure. If something wrong happens in front of us, we suck it up and simply run home to family. There is no such thing as ""right of way"" in Noida. If you ever try to fight back, even simply so much as politely correct someone, you will be in trouble. If the signal is green and you take off, but a Fortuner cuts you off, you don\'t honk or go around it. You let it go. If people behind you honk at red signal (happens too often in Noida), you break the signal and zip away. If you sit there and be a man of principle, you will get slapped soon, literally. If this is the kind of spineless and insecure life you want to live and provide to your family, come to Noida. But if you have alternatives, even Greenland or Antarctica or Colombia, take it.

You and I created the Dera Sacha Sauda. Read what it has to say before jumping the guns. [P],puri_sarang,1503734874.0,679,Politics,self.india,"""You literally can't talk about dera sachha sauda violence without discussing why deras were created in punjab and how their role and warped and changed over time. There's no point to being 'horrified'.\n\nDSS has given thousands of people across north india an identity away from the historical oppression they've known. It's given them safety. a huge number of its members are from backwards castes, who had converted to Sikhism, but found the same upper caste oppression there too. Sikhism is, in theory, casteless. The ground realities, however, are sobering and unfortunate. The jat-khatri coterie has taken over religious politicking, especially representation in sgpc and other gurudwara committee. They've systematically kept new converts out of the loop and have actively oppressed them because they represent a status quo shakeup.\n\nThis (along with other factors) has led to people being angry, helpless, disillusioned. They see no way out, no way up. They turn to drugs. Punjab and nasha have become synonymous, and this has been worsened by economic insecurity+lack of education. They're a lost people. So when the dera sachha sauda comes up as a saviour organisation, they're interested. Of course they are. The dera promises them dignity. they dera educates its people, feeds them, keeps them off drugs, gives them jobs, gives them a purpose. It gives them a dignity of being. A lost man doesn't care if a rapist gives him direction. A hungry man will take food from a murderer's hand. Never forget this.\n\nWhat you see isn't *just* an expression of misogyny and religious fervour. That too, yes, but it's actively an expression of insecurity too. What you and i see as justice, a large number of people see as a possible slide down to the pits they've barely emerged from. What you see on the today has been simmering over a generation and a half. In our race to *appear* developed, we forgot that development, as understood by very rudimentary economics, is unfair, unjust, unequal, and problematic. If nothing else, this should serve as a lesson. If we try to climb up by stepping on someone else's broken back, those people will rise.\n\nPoliticians understand this. They know a votebank when they see one, that's why they're politicians. they've been allowing these deras to flourish and mutate. Think of this as a very messed up, but immensely effective delegation system. They support the deras in their bullshit knowing the votebank will be appeased by them. this allows deras a free reign. The deras will fight each other, they will fight within themselves, and they will go to any lengths to 'win'. The politicians allow this because it also makes deras comfortably indebted to them. Think of divine right of rule. Same principle applies.\n\nWhat you have is a reckless product that feeds off people's insecurities and replaces their drugs with a more potent one- faith&security. Religion might be an opiate, but faith? Man, that's a trip if i ever saw one. DSS has a veritable army of people willing to kill for it. And we made this. We allowed this with our apathy. When you look down on the protestors, remember this. We're culpable too, massively so.\n\nEDIT: Formatting changes.

[Rant] Got harassed by traffic police. Digital India is a joke!,ishan276,1509544260.0,710,Non-Political,self.india,"'While returning from college today I got stopped by a police van. They stopped me under suspicion of driving a stolen scooty. They asked for license and I showed it to them. \n\nAfter which they asked for papers and I showed them Xerox copies and told them that my phone has DigiLocker on which they can check for my original documents. The policeman said \'Show that to Modi!\' and they started laughing. \n\nHe then proceeded to enter my details on a tablet and asked if I had changed my religion, since my dad\'s name did not show up after entering my license number. He said \'Feels like your mom is of X religion and your dad is Y religion,  that is why you\'re hiding his name\'. My license has my dad\'s name, it just did not show up on whatever App he was using on his tablet.\n\nThen he enters into the tablet that I did not show papers (registration, insurance and PUC), all of which I had by a prescribed Govt of India App. This DigiLocker App has QR codes which he could easily scan for authenticity. I even pointed out the option where he could do this on his tablet. He got angry and said \'Don\'t argue with me. You will teach me how to do my job?\' \n\nHe selected all possible fines and removed a \'challan\' receipt that said I was due 5900/- in fine and that I should go to the RTO and pay a bribe of 300-400 while showing original \'paper\' hardcopy documents and that I shouldn\'t act ""oversmart"". \n\nThese weren\'t even traffic cops, he refused to sign the receipt and got into his Qualis car and fucked off!\n\nI mean what the fuck?!  \n\n\n\nEdit: TL:DR Policeman issues a fine of 5900/- for no reason.\n\nEdit2: Not the best twitter user, this is what I could manage : \nhttps://twitter.com/ishan276/status/925742936238694400\n\nEdit3: I know 5900/- fine is absurd and sounds made up. Trust me I am shocked too. But as I have told in the main text and in several comments, the cop just happily ticked off all possible offences on his tablet. Even though I was wearing a helmet. He didn\'t even ask the people who stopped me if I had a helmet, or PUC papers. Or if there was a pillion. 5900 includes fine of pillion not wearing a helmet as well, there was no pillion and I was alone!. Others saying I should have clicked pictures and recorded the incident, my phone had DigiLocker opened on it and I was trying to show him the documents. Before I knew it he had printed the receipt of the challan. \n\nEdit4: Thank you for the comments and support on twitter, and sharing the story. Hopefully, this doesn\'t happen to anyone else. \n\nEdit5: No contact from anyone yet. If there are any lurkers who want to ask questions for an article, feel free to message. Earliest I can go to the RTO is on Tuesday morning, will make sure to at least get audio recording of that. Thanks again everyone, feeling less anxious and scared because of you people. \n\nEdit6: Allahabad Police twitter account has replied asking for a \'clear and concise\' story. Sent them the reddit link, twitter didn\'t allow me to PM them. Though they tweeted in Hindi, hopefully they\'ll accept my story in English, and then allow me to PM them.  https://twitter.com/allahabadpolice/status/925990712100913152\n\nEdit7: First content site to pick this up: http://www.theirritatedindian.com/show-it-to-modi-traffic-police-tells-biker/\n\nEdit8: Quint article : https://www.thequint.com/news/india/show-the-digilocker-app-to-modi-police-tells-biker'",7a3oh4

"As a practicing advocate, I want to tell you guys something damning about our judiciary, specifically about the Supreme Court and the High Courts.",ThisBirdDoesntFly,1482377320.0,654,Non-Political,self.india,"""Justice in India is often delayed. There are many causes for this, but one of the causes is one that has never seen public attention. I'm going to tell you what this one is. \n\nJudgments of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts are binding on the lower courts and, to a great extent, on the aforementioned courts in the future. More often than not, these judgments are presented to the courts to convince the judges. \n\nUntil 1970, the judgments of both High Courts and the Supreme Court were of adequate length. These judgments were easy to peruse and were on point. I don't know what happened, but after 1970, a majority of the judges started writing longer judgments, fluffing them up with completely useless content. Where judgments used to be 5 pages long at most, now most judgments are above 10 pages long. Worse, the average size of judgments is gradually rising. The other day, I read a Supreme Court judgment of 10 pages, of which the first 9 pages had nothing to do with the 10th page, which was the only page that talked about the final order and the reasoning behind said order. \n\nThe consequences of this blatant /r/iamverysmart attitude of the judges of the upper courts are staggering. \n\n* The amount of time they waste on writing such long judgments could have been used on deciding cases. \n\n* They set an example for the lower courts to waste needless time on longer judgments than are necessary. \n\n* Advocates find it much harder to study these judgments and consequently find much lesser time on their hands to prepare for their cases. \n\n* The judges of the lower courts waste a *lot* of time going through judgments presented by all parties before them, and often get confused due to the staggering length of the judgments. \n\n* The organizations reporting judgments of upper courts find themselves with far too many big judgments to go through, and consequently are unable to produce summaries for most judgments. Even the summaries that they produce are often inaccurate. """,5jod35

An open letter to all Indians from Kerala,LondonCapital,1496071208.0,652,Politics,self.india,"'Dear all,\n\nYesterday something happened in our state, to be precise, the very next day after the ""cattle ban for slaughter "" and the first day of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nA temple was found desecrated on Saturday near Nilambur (District of Malappuram) . The doors of the main sanctum and the idols inside were found broken. This was almost immediately followed by a hartal by Hindu Aikya Vedi. The protesters tried to block the way of Shri. Aryadan Muhammed , former Congress MLA and former minister of electricity who was there to visit the place.\n\nNext was the commencement of a direct and a social media campaign urging Hindus to be ready to open refugee camps across southern districts of Kerala. There were rumors of possible Muslim involvement. But fortunately nothing happened according to the plan of the instigators.\n\nThis was due to a timely intervention of the Kerala Police department who caught the perpetrator within 24 hours. The accused is Rajaram Mohandas, a Trivandrum resident. According to him, he did this to protest against bad customs in the Hindu religion.\n\nNot a believable story at all. Someone traveled more than 350 kms just to protest against bad customs. He just by co-incidence chose the district with the largest Muslim population. The beginning of Ramadan is another co-incidence, cattle ban law is yet another one.. A series of unfortunate co-incidences. You get the idea, don\'t you?\n\nThe timely action of our police is really commendable. Equally appreciated is the maturity and composure shown by the Hindu brothers and sisters of Malappuram who did not jump to conclusions based on rumors and cooked up stories.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the first incident of its kind. Cooked up stories have become the cause or have sparked major riots. You can find numerous examples of similar incidents all across the country. Here is a small example...\n\nPrior to the Gujarat riots, a local newspaper reported an incident, a story about how the bodies of two Hindu women were found on the banks of a river. Two days later the newspaper disawowed the story in a small column in a not so noticable place. But the damage was done. It fueled cruelty towards women during the ensuing riots\n\nBut incidents like this are new to us. We are not familiar with the purposeful spreading of lies to create a split among people of different religions and to benefit from it politically and financially.\n\nSo it is both shocking and sad to say that the gap between these kinds of incidents is becoming shorter. What they are trying to do is obvious to us. Willfully spreading false information among the people - depicting different districts of Kerala as ""Pakistan"" and ""China"" of Kerala, the state president of BJP openly lying on Twitter, spreading misinformation about the population of Kerala and the real estate business in Malappuram etc are different acts in this big political drama.\n\nTo add to this, there is also a smear campaign going on against the state of Kerala itself. If anybody feels that nothing of this sort will happen, if some innocent souls remain doubtful, let me ask them something.\n\nFour years back, did anyone think that one fine morning, all 1000 & 500 currency notes would become useless and the whole country would be asked to stand in a ""queue"" to show patriotism? By the way, did anyone know about the \'actual\' loss and/ or gains of demonetization?\n\nYou might remember the first man attacked and killed in the name of ""beef"". You might not remember those who were killed after because these incidents have lost their news value. Cows were here long before we got our freedom and they have been here for almost 69 years after. And nothing of this kind has happened ever before. If this now has become normal for you my friend...\n\nDid anyone imagine in their wildest dreams that the list of the names of students and writers who have disappeared would become this long? The answer is obvious...\n\nAll these plans are to create insecurity in the minds of the majority. The majority should feel insecure, that they are denied justice, and that they will be overpowered and outnumbered by the minority in the immediate future. Then they will enter the scene as the heroes to save the ""majority in distress""\n\nFortunately Kerala was able to avoid a communal riot. But the state saw a new kind of politics. Politics of lies. Politics trying to create split and violence to gain power and to be in power. We are thankful to the people of Kerala and the efficient police department for keeping the peace and unity of Kerala even after repeated attempts to disrupt this harmony.\n\nIs there any way to avoid the obvious?\nAnswer is yes. And it is very simple too.\n\n1. Do not jump to conclusions. If someone says that ""Hindus are not allowed to venture out to the Attingal sea"", first ask is it true or at least ask does Attingal have a sea or a beach or at least a lagoon.\n\n2. If someone poses as your savior or of your religion, first think who will have the ultimate gain. You or him? If a leader tells you to go and kill someone for Hindutva/ Christianity/ Islam, first think is it for him or for the betterment of ""said religion"".\n\n3. We are educated for a reason. Ask for the source of facts and figures. Try to understand the truth.\n\nMost importantly, build and nourish relationships. No one - neither some leader in Delhi nor the Lok Sabha or anywhere else can replace your immediate neighbor in the time of need.\n\nAt least share a smile. Say a \'Hi\'. Little things like these build bonds. Only that can resist fascism. These are bad times. If we need a better India, we must be vigilant.\n\nBe warned, these incidents will keep on happening..\n\nThank you.\n\nLove and Regards,\n\nFrom Kerala\nDr Nelson Joseph'",6e0tqp

I did not get any response from anyone.\n\nSo I filed RTI to ""PMO India"" after UIDAI refused to provide any information via RTI. \n\nCheck the response from the ""Anti Corruption"" messiah. \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3gX8o Jai Hind.\n\nEDIT 0:\nRTI Questions: \n\nIf my aadhaar number or bio-metrics(2d/3d printed fingerprint) gets misused and causes me financial loss, which organization UIDAI, Bank, NPCI, PMO , ""Finance Ministry"", etc. will compensate me?\n\nIf my aadhaar authentication fails in an website and website does not bother to resolve the authentication issue within reasonable time frame and it causes me immense mental harassment, financial loss, which organization will compensate me?\n\nIf no one is responsible for compensating me for aadhaar misuse, bio-metrics theft, authentication failure, what moral authority have you got to shove aadhaar down billion Indian\'s throat. \n\nEDIT 1: Summary of response is ""This is not a question which needs an answer""!\n\nI have already filed first appeal, complained via\nhttp://dsscic.nic.in/online-complaint-application/onlinecomplaintapplication\nnothing happened, how can a person (working for corrupt corporate) remove corruption, he can at most torture common people and opposition in the name of ""removing corruption"".\n\nEDIT 2: WTF link aadhaar to bank account knowing very well, when bank account gets looted using ""stolen fingerprint"" via aadhaar pay - UIDAI will not even file an FIR on behalf of YOU, JioCare leaked aadhaar e-KYC details for 120 million Indians, nothing happened to them, not even an FIR was filed!\n\nEDIT 3: Convert your bank balance into bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, linking aadhaar with bank will collapse Indian economy, bitcoin is widely accepted, if million Indians shift to bitcoin and start promoting it, we should be able to live with bitcoin for a long time, till aadhaar is thrown out in dustbin. Jai Hind. If you think I am bitcoin salesman, suggest a better alternative to get rid of aadhaar babajis arun jaitley, narendra modi, ravi shankar prasad ka maafi\n\n\nEDIT 4: To all RTI activists in this post,  I have filed many RTIs on other subjects, got proper response, in some cases they even accepted that to cater to my question, law needs to be changed and they have forwarded it to appropriate authority for consideration. \n\nEDIT 5: Your bank is responsible for credit card, debit card theft, call them within 24 hours of the theft, they will block card, issue replacement card with different PIN. HTF will you block aadhaar card and fingerprint? \nStolen fingerprint can be used to unlock your bio-metrics at an aadhaar enrollment center, stolen fingerprint can also be used to change your mobile number in aadhaar database, Jai Hind.\n\n\nEDIT 6: When your bank account gets looted via aadhaar pay, you will call 1947, wait for 3 hours to get connected, the call center folks will simply ask you to visit aadhaar enrollment center, waiting list being 3 months, you will bribe 1000 INR and get an appointment with aadhaar enrollment center to resolve aadhaar misuse, they will ask you to email help@uidai.gov.in, you will send 10 emails in 10 days and then get a generic mail, asking you to specify all your details including preferred condom brand, etc, you will respond with all details, you will follow up for 3 more days, then you will get a generic FINAL response, ""Please lock your bio-metrics in UIDAI website, Jai Hind!"", after that even if you send 100 emails you will NOT get any response. You lock your bio-metrics, the criminal go to an aadhaar enrollment center and unlock your bio-metrics using stolen fingerprint and keep on looting your hard earned money.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6zr2l4/locking_your_biometrics_does_not_protect_you_from/\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Refuted-Aadhaar-Biometric-12-digit-Revolution/dp/154867270X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505383796&sr=1-5&keywords=aadhaar'",6zkjcb

Today is the one-year anniversary of TRAI's prohibition of discriminatory data pricing services. Here's how it has made India one of the best places for Net Neutrality in the world.,shadowbannedguy1,1486530320.0,625,Policy/Economy,self.india,"'Ever since TRAI prohibited discriminating on data tariffs, several things happened:\n\n- Making separate ""WhatsApp"" packs or ""Facebook"" packs became illegal.  \n- Having some services free on an ISP\'s network while others were charged regular tariffs, became illegal. Eg. Wynk, Airtel\'s music service.  \n- No Internet provider could any longer compete on which popular service they could ""garden-wall"" for a lower price than the rest of the Internet -- it was now either all of the Internet, or none of it at all.   \n- No app/website/service could now tie up with an ISP in order to get an edge over other content providers who couldn\'t afford such an arrangement.  \n\nThe TRAI prohibition forced Internet providers to make a \'level playing field\' a reality. **No country in the world, be it the US or an EU member nation, has such a comprehensive bright line regulation to ban zero-rating.**\n\nIn places like the US, where Net Neutrality laws only focus on speed, zero-rating has become very common, with carriers like T-Mobile having plans where some services are free on mobile data, while the rest of the Internet is paid.\n\nWith the appeal that zero-rating has, but with the [disastrous implications](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20160208/06220233547/india-bans-zero-rating-as-us-pays-price-embracing-it.shtml) it would have resulted in, we need to be thankful that our telecom regulator had the foresight to set a bright-line regulation to ban discriminatory data pricing.\n\n# What remains to be done\n\nA crucial aspect of Net Neutrality is **traffic management**. Internet providers need to manage traffic to manage the health and stable functioning of their network. However, many ISPs use ""traffic management"" as an excuse to systematically under-invest in network infrastructure and slow down services that compete with those they have an interest in. Some ISPs also put a bouquet of services on a ""fast lane"", which have faster speeds not because of better peering, but because the rest of the Internet is *necessarily* slowed down compared to them.\n\nTRAI\'s [current Net Neutrality consultation paper](http://trai.gov.in/consultation-paper-net-neutrality-0) seeks to address this issue, and define *what* exactly reasonable traffic management practices are. Please give this consultation paper a read -- I believe this final consultation process can make India the absolute best country in the world in terms of Net Neutrality regulation, bar website blocking.\n\n'",5sqrui
Demonetization : it's over. Government won.,bad_joke_maker,1482141829.0,620,Demonetization,self.india,"'I was hoping that a bad step and worse implementation would lead to at least some damage to the government electorally. But, probably somewhere in my heart I still thought the government to be the good guys though egoistic. \n\nTwo recent steps have shattered my faith in the goodness of the government as well as confirmed to my rational mind that they are going to sweep every election. \n\nFirst is the limit of only 5000 INR till the end of the year for deposit. This way they will manipulate the total amount of money back into the system and force a windfall. That number will be shown as the success of the exercise. Then it will be used for sops in the budget. \n\n\nSecond step is the partiality towards places where elections are going to happen for remonetization. This is so vicious. Basically, if you create artificial scarcity and then be partial to some people, they will not remember that you are the source of the scarcity. The people will just be grateful to you. This ensures victory in UP. \n\nI feel betrayed as a citizen, but I can see it rationally. It is over. The government won. \n\nJai Hind. Jai Modi. Bharat Mata ki jai. I am defeated and will now agree with everything the government says.'",5j5nbp

[NP] Answered : Why scientists don't work for India?,ameyano_acid,1500433294.0,613,[R]eddiquette,self.india,"'I feel Reddit is a safe place to share this.\n\nI\'m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Biotechnology and I\'m currently in my second year. I always talk about going abroad to study further and a very stupid statement I hear every time is - ""You should stay back and work for your country.""\n\nMy answer usually is -\n\n1. Fuck you. (I don\'t say this aloud.)\n\n2. How about you stop being cunts to scientists and stop promoting fuckall cow logic to other people? There is so much pseudo science in this country, no scientist wants to stay back that\'s for sure. (No offense to ISRO people because luckily we don\'t doubt the existence of space at least.)\n\n3. India, as a country gives AWAY billions of Rupees to temples and religious places. This is a very major problem. Temples should fund scientific research as they get so much money whereas students like us have to beg for sponsorships (which nobody offers) to fund our research.\n\n4. The government does not promote science at  school level whatsoever and teaches students Ramayana with flying monkeys lifting mountains for just one bloody plant. (Cuz fuck ecology eh?)\n\n5. India lacks R&D attitude and we probably are the least innovative country in terms of life sciences and ground breaking research. Sabko engineer hi banna hai? (No offense but I\'ve seen dumb kids trying to become engineers then drop out and then do some stupid course. Every parent wants their child to be an engineer for some apparent engineer. Both my elder sisters are and my parents wanted me to become one too. I resisted. I get dissed everyday.)\n\n6. The last Nobel prize an Indian won was in 2009. And before that in 1927. Superpower by 2020 my ass.\n\n7. Illiteracy is a problem in this country and students like us would love to see India making it big but politicians are amazing and say cows inhale oxygen and exhale oxygen. Cows excrete plutonium (ikr!) and what not.\n\n8. The laboratories offered to undergraduate students are pathetic. Any high school in the West has a better laboratory than ours. We have to manually do all the tedious work which could be easily automated with the right equipment but NOOOOOOOOO. Ambulances for cows please.\n\n9. When was the last time you donated money to Science? I\'m sure you can recall donating a ton to temples.\n\n10. Godmen are more popular than scientists. Everyone knows Asaram Bapu and Radhe Maa. Ever heard of Har Gobind Khorana? (Many of you must know about him but you have to agree scientists and engineers are less popular than actors and godmen.)\n\nTL;DR : This country is fucked up and full of pseudo science. Nobody in at least a few decades can reverse this idiocy.\n\nSorry for the long post and I know this sounds like a massive rant but this is very frustrating and I\'m totally venting this out.\n\nAlso, make sure you try not to ask a scientist to stay back and work here.\n\nCheers! :) I hope butthurt idiots don\'t read this or I\'ll be lynched. \n\n-A\n\n'",6o5rl5

"75,000+ kms of train journey made me realize few uplifting things about Indians: We are compassionate, kind hearted and often, generous..",wordswithmagic,1488440994.0,593,Non-Political,self.india,"""I am from Lucknow, studied in Mangalore for 5 years. Used to travel to-and-fro atleast 3 times a year by train, and it is a 2500 kms distance. \n\nWhile travelling across UP, MP, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and sometimes Tamil Nadu, I realized few uplifting facts: We Indians are compassionate, we are kind-hearted and often generous as well.\n\nFour incidents to prove my point:\n\n- Once, I forgot to bring along my damn ticket. IRCTC website hadn't yet comeup, and it was still the physical ticket which ruled. The journey was from Mumbai to Mangalore via Matyagandha Express, and the ticket checker was a Muslim from Mumbai with heavy beard. I showed him my college ID, hostel pictures (actual album.. there was no mobile in 2000), told him my story, and even asked his address so that I can send him the penalty later. He not only offered me his own berth (Side-upper), but also offered me tea, lunch and some money so that I can reach my hostel safely. \n\n- Once near Jhansi, a man was sitting on the lower berth, and suddenly the glass window fell down, without any warning. His fingers received the impact, and they started bleeding. A young Hindu rural women, with veil covering her head, and mehendi dotting her hands (most probably newly married), stood up, removed the veil, tore a piece of cloth from ther luggage, and before anyone can react, started tightening the bleeding fingers. She went to adjacent coaches, brought an antiseptic, and applied that so that there is no freaking infection. Personally, it was a very touching moment for me. \n\n- I was travelling with a female friend, and she was sleeping since last 15 hours, on the upper berth. The train passed Mangalore, crossed Madgaon,. reached Mumbai, and she was still sleeping like a log. I was in lower berth, reading a book. I was alone having food and stuff, while she kept on sleeping. My neibhours, an aged couple with a grown up girl couldn't stop themselves. The lady poked me, asked if everything is fine with the girl who is sleeping since last 15 hours. I said yes, fine. She is a chronic sleeper, I said. And I also said thank you for the concern. \n\n- I was somewhere between Coimbatore and Chennai, and had no money to buy food. The train change was at Chennai, and one of my friends was supposed to meet me, and give me some money for the journey. A muslim family checked in, somewhere in between, with huge vessels carrying biryani and raita and stuff. Right in front of me, they started eating it, as the delicious aroma filled the compartment. They offered me thrice, and on the fourth attempt, I said yes. The satisfaction from eating biryani after 10 hours of fasting left a lasting impression on my psyche. I remember that when I went into the bathroom, I had tears in my eyes. \n\nYes, sometimes we do act strange, but trust me, overall we are nice bunch of people. India rocks!\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold, O stranger! Reddit has been way too kind on me. Feeling blessed. """,5x1zma

It will also be mandatory to link your Aadhaar card to your PAN card, or the latter will become invalid after July 1, 2017. *Enough discussion on this topic on reddit/r/india already*\n\nWith the Finance Bill, 2017, people can make use of the 'electoral bonds' to donate to political parties anonymously. *that's hypocrisy of the government and just not in line with the thought process they are using to link everything with Aadhar*\n\nThe Bill has also removed the cap of how much one (or a company) can donate to a political party. *Again, seriously?*\n\nFinance Bill, 2017 also brings down the threshold limit of cash payments from Rs 3 lakhs to Rs 2 lakhs. *so linked bank accounts, phone numbers provide them all the data of my spending and usage, no robust cyber security infrastructure in place either*\n\n**Why aren't we raising our voice against such hypocrisy of government and undemocratic law that is passed, this will change almost everything in times to come?**\n**Why are all opposition parties mum on the topic and why aren't we seeing day long discussions on this important topic by media houses?**""",61xid4

There is this ""Mehrangarh Cafe"" inside the fort that charges exorbitant prices for for basic refreshments like club sandwich (₹350). There were around 15 tables in the cafe, all were occupied by foreigners except one. We took that table and tried to order some food.\n\nThe manager of the cafe and the cafe staff ignored us when we called them for order. They were all busy serving foreign folks. We called four different staff to take our order none of them responded. We then called the manager again and he told us that one of them will be taking our order soon. But for 45 minutes no one came to take our order. The entire cafe staff was trained to serve foreigners first and they were glued to their tables. Some of them were simply standing idle by their table but they won\'t come to take our order.\n\nAfter a long wait, they took order and we finished our meal in two and half hours which could have been completed in 30-45 minutes max.\n\nWhile paying for the bill I talked to the manager about their ways of handling Indian customers. He didn\'t give a damn and was pretty vocal that foreigners meant big bucks to them. \n\nI can only guess that their average billing per foreigner is higher than average billing per Indian customer.\n\nThe cafe was only place inside the fort to get a proper meal so we had no other choice. I understand that they are there to make money, but I felt really bad that they simply had no respect for fellow Indian citizens :('",5dqwgh

"YSK: Malvinder and Shivinder Singh now run hospital chains, and it's very important that you know about their handling of erstwhile company Ranbaxy!",NotThatLebowski1,1500044116.0,556,[R]eddiquette,self.india,"'Once there was a company called Ranbaxy Labs. It had a wonderful reputation: it was profitable, it was pioneering. In fact, its reputation could even be called saintly: after all, did it not manufacture generic drugs, all manner of life-saving medicines? Was it not curing AIDS in Africa? Are not such companies deserving of admiration, capable of making a profit and yet selling affordable medicines? Ranbaxy was the backbone of a pharmaceutical sector of which we in India were told to be proud—and Indians don’t need to be told twice to be proud of something.\n\n\n\n\nWell, one sad and tragic day, the people who built Ranbaxy decided to sell it to a Japanese company called Daiichi Sankyo. The good people of Daiichi Sankyo had done their due diligence: they had inspected the books, talked to managers, toured the plants, and come to the conclusion that, yes, they were worthy of buying the gem that was Ranbaxy, the first foreign company to sell generic medicines in the US. When Ranbaxy was sold, there was much weeping and gnashing of teeth in India; a precious jewel had been given away for something as crass as money. India mourned.\n\n\nDaiichi Sankyo paid $4.6 billion for two-thirds of Ranbaxy in 2008. They must have thought they’d got an exceptionally good deal—the very last act of selfless altruism performed by Ranbaxy’s promoters. Six years later, the Japanese were glad to sell what remained of Ranbaxy to one of its competitors, for $3.2 billion. The company had lost half its value in six years.\n\n\n\nIt turned out they’d been sold a placebo.\nHere’s a little bit of what was actually going on in Ranbaxy, the pride of Indian pharma. Just a taste. In one plant’s supposedly sanitized room where medicines were made, there were flies ‘too numerous to count’.40 Elsewhere, the refrigerators that were supposed to keep samples at a predetermined low temperature were broken, with pools of water from melted ice inside. Some of the pills chosen at random and inspected had what seemed to be hair from an employee’s arm; others had compressed and mysterious black spots that turned out to be the oil that lubricated the plant’s machinery. And, to top off the ewww factor, one factory didn’t have any running water in the toilets, so no employee had been able to wash their hands for a really long time. Remember, this is a medicine factory.\n\nMeanwhile, it turned out that the medicines they were making weren’t just full of nasty stuff, they didn’t work to start off with. Ranbaxy had to plead guilty to felony charges in the United States, because some of the medicines they were making were ‘adulterated’; they had to pay a $500-million fine.\n\n\nOne by one, Ranbaxy’s plants were declared unsafe; eventually not one of the four could still export to the US—the major market for its generic version of Lipitor, taken by the millions of Americans who’re watching their cholesterol levels. Millions of Ranbaxy’s Lipitor tablets had to be recalled from chemists across the US when glass particles were discovered in them.\n\n\n\n\nCraziest of all, it turned out Ranbaxy had been methodically falsifying its test records. Batch after batch of its generics was shown as genuine in the test documents—all of which were invented. Regulators in South Africa realized that AIDS drugs from the saintly people at Ranbaxy were little better than placebos when all the test data for various different batches turned out to be identical—and photocopied. They didn’t even do a good job with the faking. Well, sometimes they tried harder with the faking. On one occasion, they forged some documentation about data they had to show regulators, which was supposed to be from years earlier—and, to take that new-paper feel away, they aged it in a steam room overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, in some parts of the world, it was just presenting completely false data. In Brazil, of the 163 medicines that it was selling, it had properly tested only eight. Every step of the way, Ranbaxy behaved like a good Indian teenager taking a test: it cheated when it could, and gamed the test when it couldn’t cheat. Sometimes, former employees claimed, it would just buy brand-name drugs, and submit them to the FDA as its own in order to pass the tests.\n\n\n\n\nAll this was known to managers in 2004. Two brave managers, both relatively fresh hires, launched an investigation; one eventually got to say his piece to the company’s board. According to Fortune magazine, he told the board that ‘more than 200 products in more than 40 countries’ had ‘elements of data that were fabricated to support business needs’. He wound up urging a recall of major drugs, and coming clean to regulators. Fortune says, ‘Kumar completed the presentation to a silent boardroom. Only one director, a scientist, showed any surprise about the findings. The others appeared more astonished by Kumar’s declaration that if he was not given full authority to fix the problems, he would resign.’ Naturally, he quit in two days. \n\n\n\n According to Fortune, elaborate falsification of data was discussed at length in email chains that included Ranbaxy’s CEO and a member of the family that owned it. On one conference call, when the uselessness of its AIDS drugs in Africa was discussed, a senior executive apparently said: ‘Who cares? It’s just blacks dying.’ Remember, all this was, at the very least, known internally before Ranbaxy’s owners sold it to the Japanese. **As one US regulator said, the company’s culture was ‘corrupt to the core’**. I suppose it’s a small step from concealing the kind of drugs you’re making before you sell them to concealing the kind of company you’re running before you sell it.\n--Source: Restart India: The Last Chance for Indian Economy by Mihir Sharma\n\n_________________________________________\n\nThe former owners of Ranbaxy now run one of India’s largest hospital chains (Fortis Healthcare and Religare Wellness). \n\nNow, what is the reason of posting all this. One of my neighbors who is a 40 yrs old person had a bit of pain in his chest. He took some medicine but the pain kept coming after sometime. He went to get it checked in Fortis hospital. The hospital doctors claimed he arteries in his heart were not working well and he immediately needed a bypass surgery. Now this person is 40 years old with a bit of problem of High Blood Pressure. He got shit scared and even was thinking of getting it done. After all, a reputed hospital like Fortis says; it must be true. One of his relatives is a doctor with another hospital. His consulted him before fixing the date for surgery. This doctor ran couple of checks and figured out, the pain was because of furniture he helped moving from ground floor to 3rd floor couple of days.\n\nJust be careful guys. Everyone out there is looking for opportunities to screw you up; especially these motherfucking big hospital chains.\n\nEDIT: Many are asking for links.

TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,rahultheinvader,1502098509.0,542,Politics,self.india,"'Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. \n\nOn the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. \n\nSo here we go\n\n* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. \n\n* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna\n\n* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.\n\n* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important\n\n* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.\n\n* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities\n\n* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship \n\n* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.\n\n* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. \n\n* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. \n\n* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat\n\n* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action\n\n* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. \n\n* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** \n\n* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.\n\n* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.\n\n* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**\n\n* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. \n\n* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)\n\n* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) \n\n* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.\n\nRamdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. \n\nFinally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.\n\nEdit 1: Formatting\n\nEdit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. '",6s4hoh

I am no more a bhakt !!,former_bhakt,1502670790.0,535,Politics,self.india,"'You know, I was a bhakt, during the 2014 elections. I had so many heated debates with colleagues at work, friends. I don\'t know why but I felt bjp and modi govt is going to change everything. A lot of people from my circle were already leaning towards voting for Modi but then some of them got another option in form of Kejru and this lead to hours of debates during lunch hours, after work over daru sessions, then came the elections and the decisive mandate made me orgasm. I was a devout bhakt. \n\nI started to think a bit differently after the debacle of kejru in Pubjab elections and when he and all his supporters went silent. I did not have the defend each and every govt action. I also realized what all the whatsapp group have become. Family, friend groups - if there is even a slightly negative news about modi, people are not willing to accept it. This started irritating me and all the news about lynchings, gau rakshaks put me off. Today, I decided I am no longer going to vote for this government again. The overall environment is hate filled and people can go as far to attack someone if they have an opposite view. I realize now that I was also part of this same group not long ago but I guess I am wiser now and willing to accept other views. \n\nApologies to all the people who I might have offended during my bhakti days. \n\nAnd looking at the totalitarian regime we are moving towards I dont want to remain silent.

Lessons of Working with Indian Students in the United States,PFpaTROLL,1489803260.0,507,Non-Political,self.india,"""Given all the killings and racism involving Indians in the United States coming up since our November election, I wanted to share my personal experiences working with NRIs and their children in the Southern US.\n\nIn between university and pursuing an advanced degree I ended up in a job where I was educating high school students (14-18 years old), the majority of whom were the first generation children of NRIs or whose families had left India while they were young. I did not know this going into the job and was initially a bit apprehensive about it because I did not know how well I would relate to these students - I am completely white. It turned out to be one of the best and most rewarding educational experiences I've ever had. \n\nA lot of white Americans expect a high standard of living, owning a nice home and a nice car, having a well-paying job, a beautiful spouse, et cetera, despite the fact that they are totally mediocre in every way and do not make much of an effort to rectify this. One of the first things I noticed was that Indian families almost never had this attitude. They taught their kids that it was worthwhile to try very hard to learn and excel in academics so they could make a good life for themselves and genuinely encouraged their curiosity about the world around them. As an educator, having a majority of parents be like that and having a majority of students being raised in that kind of environment was extremely enjoyable for me. Every day many (not all, no group is homogenous) Indian students were trying to really push their boundaries and learn as much as possible whereas most American teenagers are pretty jaded at that age. \n\nIn the USA there is often a stereotype that Indians are cheap, that they will do anything to avoid spending money. That was not my experience at all. On average, if something had an educational purpose, like a national/international science or humanities competition or an academic text, the Indian parents would be far more willing to spend money on it than the white American ones. In addition, every time there was a school event in the evening, the Indian mothers would prepare amazing home-cooked Indian food for everyone that we all thought was very delicious. Now that I've moved to a major city, I order pav bhaaji all the time because of this. I also received amazingly thoughtful gifts and words of appreciation just for doing my best to do my job in a competent way. When my phone was stolen and I couldn't afford to get a nice one to replace it, some of the parents bought me the new iPhone and insisted I keep it after I tried to give it back to them. It was a massive act of generosity and I never forget it when I use my phone. \n\nI also had an amazing experience learning about some of the arts and culture of India. Since childhood, I've possessed an avid interest in film and was surprised when these high school kids were talking about so many movies I had never heard of. I came to realize that India had several massive film industries that had put out many amazing movies (and, to be fair, plenty of hilariously bad ones too). My students were extremely excited when they realized I was also beginning to watch some of these movies, and so as a reward for when students had spent long weekends in academic competitions I would sometimes put on Indian movies (they are almost all appropriate for school settings by the standards of American film!) and let the students take turns explaining things to me for a change. I also learned, even though I had previously studied philosophy extensively, that clear antecedents of many important concepts in western philosophy can be found in various Hindu texts, which western authors typically don't credit. \n\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of these students told me that no white American had ever taken this kind of an interest in their families and culture before, even though many of them had been in the US for more than a decade. I do not think Indian culture is perfect by any means, and there are several areas where I hope to see it change one day, but that is not the point of this discussion. The point of this discussion is that a disgusting group of Americans hate and sometimes even kill Indians when they don't know anything about them. Not only that, if they learned some lessons from them, supported the other families in their community, worked half as hard, and encouraged their kids to be educated half as much, they wouldn't be so angry about not being able to casually walk into a job paying $50-60k in manufacturing with no skills or higher education and would instead be taking steps to effectively deal with their problems and raise their children to be more equipped for the modern world. So many people are so quick to demand visa cuts and some are even quick to pull a trigger, but if they tried to learn something from the people they want to go away, maybe they might find a real solution to their problems.

"[NP] Dear Randia, my college, St. Joseph's College - Bangalore, fired a teacher for his opinion on homosexuality, here is the story",awkwardpile,1489167240.0,499,Non-Political,self.india,"'I wanted to share this here, here is the news story: http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/mar/09/bengalurus-st-josephs-college-sacks-lecturer-allegedly-over-his-homosexuality-1579637.html\n\nThe sheer hypocrisy shown by the college and the teacher\'s own colleagues is surprising.\n\nHere is the teacher\'s story from his Facebook feed:\n\n>So at 9:30 am on March 9 2017, while I am in the middle of a BCom Second Year class, I am asked to come down and meet the Principal of St. Joseph’s College of Arts and Sciences, Fr. Victor Lobo, immediately (so much for any respect for the teacher and classroom and the process of teaching and learning, from the Jesuits). Once there, he makes me wait for 10 minutes outside the office, while my students are waiting in class. Then he calls me in and tells me: “Students are disturbed by your personal opinions. The management has got to know of these opinions. I have been asked to relieve you with immediate effect.” “Really? What opinions?” I ask. “Students are very much disturbed by your opinions (sic). You were hired to teach English Literature. Not to give your personal opinions. Please sign these letters. Leave the college with immediate effect. No need to take any more classes. We will manage,” comes the reply. I remember my contract which says I can be removed “with no reasons assigned.” I get up and leave. I also remember that I need one month\'s notice according to the contract. But never mind. Throughout this meeting, if anyone is disturbed, it is the Principal. He looks ashen-faced, his hands are shaking, his mouth is dry. I am not surprised by this. In classes, my students have talked about what they don’t like about this Principal, even as they love their college. This is my comeuppance for having those discussions.\n\n>This is the Principal who finds a boy and girl sharing headphones immoral and he penalises them for it. This is the Principal who finds a girl hugging a boy on his birthday offensive and penalises her asking what sort of family she comes from where people hug. This is the Principal who pulls students out of the exam, trauamtises them by confiscating their ID cards because they have long hair (boys), are wearing ear studs (boys), have colour in their hair (girls), have a tear in their jeans (boys and girls). This is the Principal who makes students buy concert tickets to raise funds for the college and if they don’t, informs then that they will not get their hall tickets for the exams. This is the Principal who forces students to pay Rs. 500 for the new college building, shaming them by pointing to how expensive their mobile phones are. This is the Principal who does not allow students to cut a cake on their birthdays. This is the Principal who says women, especially, must not to go to pubs. This is the Principal who tells students not to have any relationships out of family. This is the Principal who forces Christian students to go to mass or confiscates IDS and does not give them hall tickets. This is the Principal who says boys and girls should not go for films together. This is the Principal who allows teachers to not allow boys and girls to sit together. This is the Principal who does not like to see boys and girls walk together. This is the Principal who has draconian hostel rules for boys, let alone girls. I could go on but this is enough. This is the Principal whose justification for all this is that Christ University is doing this and we should not give the impression that we are liberal. This is the great Christ University where a student was raped by a priest a few years ago and not only was it hushed up, the student was further traumatised, blamed, forced to leave and she disappeared.\n\n>Yet students take all of this lying down. There is no Pinjra Tod in any of the St. Joseph’s institutions or indeed any institution in Bangalore. These rules apply to most of the Jesuit and Christian institutions all over Bangalore. Teachers take this lying down and have many of these rules applied to them too. They are viewed with suspicion and monitored through a spy network among students (how well Jesuits train their students!) some members of which doubtless reported on me as I have discussions with students in practically every class and in extra-curricular activities on these issues, issues they are very upset about, issues that affect their lives in terrible ways. These students are damaged and policed and surveilled and stunted.\n\n>Yet their parents love this happening to their kids. They agree to an SMS being sent to them every time their kids bunk one class. They silently cough up the money asked for for buildings and concerts held to build buildings. They probably would love to police their children in similar ways at home and many probably do.\n\n>This is the network of family, school, college and institutions in general that stymie the growth of young minds. This is the Taliban with a liberal face.\n\n>When a teacher asks students to think, to think critically, to ask questions, to find out how much labourers doing the furious building on campus are being paid, to think about the implications of this Talibanisation of student lives on the gendered futures of the society we live in, to not be intimidated by threats of being asked to take a Transfer Certificate (TC) and leave if they don’t like things here, they are fired as their opinions are apparently “disturbing” the students. “The students are very much disturbed (sic),” I was told by this Principal who ostensibly has a PhD in English but has never taught an English class in college., who occasionally takes a Theology class and tells 18 years olds that reading fancy Literature in their elite Departments where even the teachers do not like them (entirely made up and putting students against teachers) does not help, that all they need to read is the Bible. That is the true and only Literature.\n\n>I wish the students were really disturbed. **It is the job of the teacher to keep the student disturbed**. If the student is not disturbed, how will anything change in the world? To be destabilised, to be disturbed is the achievement of the teacher. It is not a reason to fire a teacher.\n\n>My only hope is that this case will make students stand up for their rights: the right to a democratic education, the right to a context of democratic practice in education which the Karnataka government and the Constitution of India (which institutions, minority ones or otherwise, have to follow) guarantees not institutions that make up more and more bizarre rules and force them on students.\n\n>As for me, this is not a new story. This is not the first time this has happened to me and it will not be the last. But, unlike the students, I have not, am not and will not take it lying down.\n\nThis dude is one of the only few sane minds we have on the campus. Also, he is a PhD from Cambridge and has been faculty over IIT-H, Ramjas College, St. Stephen\'s, Cambride, St. Xavier etc. With over a decade and half experience. \n\nMost of the faculty, including English, in our college does bakchodi and chutiyapa. Teachers hardly seem passionate about their work. And those who indeed are, this is what they do to them. As a student I can vouch for everything he said about our college and the Principal, Victor Lobo. \n\nWhat\'s astounding is the silence of his own colleagues. The English department which compares Catholic Riots in England with the ""phase"" our country is going right now. The people from the very same department who every time talk about Islamophobia, and how RSS is taking over Bangalore, and how minorities are not safe, and other liberal gibberish, the same English department is silent over something that happened to one of them!\n\nThis is also the same college which hosted a TEDx conference on Homosexuality a few weeks back. Hypocrisy much ? Hosts talks over national and even international issues, but has little tolerance to anything that happens inside the campus.\n\nAnd as he said, nothing would change as in the end the parents here are indeed okay with all this moral policing and everything the colleges and other institutes make their children go through. What\'s sad is the silence of people, the teachers who go on extreme liberal mode while teaching, have gone silent now.'",5ynexd

<Serious> Pregnant and heading towards termination alone.,scared_n_nervous,1481263574.0,482,AskIndia,self.india,"'My UPT strip displayed 2 lines yesterday morning I am freaking out since then. I have consulted 2 gynacs already yesterday, one straight away denied by saying abortion is not supported by the hospital she is practicing in and didn\'t gave any other details of the process or options i am left with. Once i asked for a refund of consultation fees she was not comfortable doing that either. Even if it was a christian missionary hospital what they did was unethical. Keeping this aside, the second gynac I went to asked few personal details, suggested me a sonography and scheduled another appointment with the father of the kid or guardian. Here i don\'t understand why do I need anyone along for this decision? I excused her saying my mate is not in town and she kept on insisting on some guardian to be around. Honestly, I don\'t want to involve him in this. Or anyone else for that matter. ( Please don\'t ask me why, how, when etc ""W"" ""H"" questions. ) The problem is I am already 6 weeks down. I don\'t have much time left for non surgical procedure. \n\nAny suggestions on this will be really helpful. \n\n*Trolls please excuse, not this day, not this thread please* \n\n\n\n**Edit 1:** Thank you all for your help. I have just returned from getting my sonograhy done. The radiologist says its not ectopic sac though she has found some cyst on my left ovary and wants to me consult gynac tomorrow. Can any one around please tell me if there will be any complications in terminating the pregnancy due to this cyst? Or any other complications for that matter. \n\n'",5hc864

The massive corruption you never heard of - multi-billionaires Adani and Ambani vs an India without electricity,indianspoiler,1508676780.0,484,Policy/Economy,self.india,"""So Adani , Ambani and Tatas started setting up power plants in Gujarat and Maharashtra with Business Plan of importing cheaper yet quality coals from Indonesia. The coal price was then used to fix power plant tariffs.\n\nIndonesian Govt then realizes that it has such a bad deal and passes a law to put its coal prices to international market price - basically now the coal is costlier\n\nSuddenly the rich indian business men go to Central Electricity Regulatory commission to tell that - hey the coal prices are now up and the power plant is unsustainable - no electricyt for u poor people in india....so CERC makes a committee to investigate and finally approves the end tariff to go high\n\nOn the other end these business bought stakes in indonesian mines, made JVs and some agreements blah blah. But the point is they were basically their own subsidiaries. Now when u sell an inflated electricity adn pay inflated coal price - the profit is not going to indonesia - it is actually going to you\n\nAdani did not stop there... in the invoice submitted they also submitted increased Power plant equipment prices. Now this is weird as all plants should be importing similar equipment right? - But Adani bhai made a front in Dubai to help himself. But why to over invoice just the power equipment- they also massively over invoiced coal itself. All coals were also invoiced up both interms of quality and quantity. When people will pay through increased tariff - then lets make moolah.\n\nBy the way - how does invoicing gets done so easily? - whel because Adani owns the fucking port itself\n\nCERC committe approved all of this - even though KPMG was consulting them and in its report it showed that Adani basically owned the mine, the equipment supplying co and the power plant itself.\n\nthat committe had 2 prominent people - Mr Deepak Parekh who was HDFC chairman and head of SBI Capital Markets - Ms Arundhati Bhattacharya ---yes the same who went on to become SBI's chairman\n\nMore links:\nPIL about this which I am sure will go nowhere :\nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/over-invoicing-by-power-companies-pil-in-delhi-hc-seeks-sit-probe-against-firms-4842567/\n\nDRI investigations:\n http://www.epw.in/journal/2016/14/web-exclusives/how-over-invoicing-imported-coal-has-increased-power-tariffs.html\n\nThere are links in the articles itself - so help urself\n\nFinally link on Australian investigations about Adani's fronts in Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/16/adani-mining-giant-faces-financial-claims-as-it-bids-for-australian-coal-loan\n\nOriginal Article:\n\nhttp://www.epw.in/journal/2016/20/web-exclusives/power-tariff-scam-gets-bigger-rs-50000-crore.html\nHate Capitalism anyone?\n""",7800uc

PSA: Get Kicked Out of a WhatsApp Group. [NP],_2_4_8,1479539470.0,471,Non-Political,self.india,"'*What you read on WhatsApp is the truth, everything else is just a lie.* \n\n-UNESCO\n\nOne of the key features missing in WhatsApp is the ability to stop people from adding you in groups. Sure, you can exit one, but there’s no way to stop them from adding you again, unless you block them, or ask them to stop doing so. The latter, is highly unlikely.\n\nDay before yesterday, I was added into a WhatsApp group of 34 people, by noon, it had enlarged itself to 44, I left, but the 5 admins kept putting me in it. I barely knew half a dozen people in that group. I asked them politely to stop adding me, but was met with replies like *“Kya yarr?” “Kuch nehi hoga…blah blahh….”*\n\nSeeing no option, I muted that group late at night and went to sleep, stupid me, muted it for only 8 hours. In the morning when I woke up, and turned on data, my fuckin WhatsApp blew up with over a 1000 messages; my phone nearly hanged.\n\nI left, was added again, I called the scumbag out, but it fell on deaf ears. This is getting a little cumbersome, you alll know what is going on, so without further ado, I give you the recipe to rekt a whatsapp group and get kicked out.\n\nI muted that group yesterday, and slept on it with an alarm set for 5 AM this morning. Sure enough, 700 unread messages, last text was at 2:40 AM, and some forwards I don’t care for. \n\nI personally looked up each and everyone of those people that were in that group, not one was online. NICE!\n\nI went into **SETTINGS>ABOUT PHONE>LEGAL INFORMATION>OPEN SOURCES LEGAL**\n\nThe /Kernel file alone was about the size of the Bible. I copied all of it and pasted it in the WhatsApp group. All and all, I kept sending that same shit for around 40 mins. \n\nI went to sleep and woke up at 8 AM, turned on WhatsApp and one guy is calling me a chut. By 9:30, one guy is complaining that his phone froze and he had to take out the battery, another is calling me out personally, I blocked him. The scumbags have now started revolting against me, by 11 AM, one of the admins who got the kick of his life, kicked me out. \n\nSo there you go, 100% tried, tested, and certified by UNESCO method of getting kicked out of WhatsApp groups.\n'",5drefr

"[NP] TIFU by going to the wrong college by 2,900 kilometres",drtweety,1501691631.0,439,Non-Political,self.india,"""Like most TIFUs, this didn't happen today, but ~10 days ago.\n\nUS applications for colleges begin in late august. I’d decided to join an NIT in India until I got a response from the states. I got accepted to National Institute of Technology(NIT) - Andhra Pradesh, or so I thought.\n\nMy dad and a couple friends decided to make the journey memorable and go by road. All cool. We drove across Maharashtra, into Telangana and finally to Andhra. A 930 Kilometre journey, and given how Indian roads are, it took us 16 hours; though we did stop several times for bird spotting, and adoring the view of herds of deers galloping along the horizon.\n\nRegardless, the road trip was riddled with mind blowing greenery of the South Indian country side as we drove toward our destination, Tadepalligudem; where the NIT campus is situated.\n\nWe finally report to the campus, and move towards the admissions counter. The attendant there straight away denies us citing that I was never granted an admission in NIT-AP.\n\nPanicking, we report to the admissions coordinator, who explains:\n\nOn my allotment letter, it was stated that I had gotten accepted to “NIT-AP”(In that exact phrase). The problem here is, there’s an Andhra Pradesh and an Arunachal Pradesh. Both are referred to as “AP”. Basically, I travelled 930 kilometres to the wrong state.\n\nNo where in the allotment letter had they stated “Arunachal Pradesh”, and living in the state right next to Andhra Pradesh, all six of the people with me never even thought of it; we went all the way there, only to find out we’d come to the wrong state, 2,930 kilometres away.\n\nBut we had a fun road trip! So yay….. I guess?\n\nTL;DR: My allotment letter stated I had been accepter at NIT AP; being from Maharashtra, I assumed it was Andhra Pradesh and did not even consider the fact that it could've been Arunachal. Basically, went 2,900 kms to the wrong NIT AP.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the great wholesome comments, I'm really enjoying them! And no, I'm not going to Arunachal Pradesh to study anymore. \n\nEDIT: Here's a picture of the letter https://m.imgur.com/a/d3x4s""",6r5dw9

Solid advice from Biswa Kalyan Rath,Keerikkadan91,1491336131.0,442,[R]eddiquette,self.india,"""> Young people in my newsfeed. College students, school students.\n\n> Another suicide has taken place. Another life is lost. I don't know any other way to motivate you than saying this.\n\n> My CGPA in college was 6.83 out of 10 or less, I can't remember or find that grade sheet. I almost failed in many subjects. I don't know anything about biotechnology.\n\n> I did not get placement in any company. To put that in perspective, IITs have a near 100% placement rate.\n\n> I wasn't good at anything then. I could play some shit on a guitar, or write a poem on some blog or click horrible photos with a DSLR camera. Complete lack of skill, completely unhirable.\n\n> My first job was a sales job and I was fired after 3 months. Monthly salary was 15k, which seems decent but all my friends were earning at least thrice the amount.\n\n> I was also going through personal problems as well, which I don't want to get into but I was emotionally fucked as well.\n\n> These things made me feel like a spectacular failure.I was depressed for a couple of years and I lost around 8 kgs. I was thin to begin with. Thankfully I had friends to support me throughout.\n\n> After a couple of years, as I kept doing what I believed I would be good at, things started getting better slowly and steadily. I was a horrible graphic designer, a horrible web designer, a horrible coder, a horrible writer and a bad comedian for quite some time. I have embarrassed myself enough and been bad at multiple fields. But with support from close friends, I kept working at it.\n\n> Suddenly one day, things changed for the better and people who I assumed thought of me as a failure started messaging me saying they were proud of me. People started appreciating my work.\n\n> Today, I don't feel like a failure despite whoever feels whichever way and I am happy with my life. And that's a big deal.\n\n> Not everybody has as good friends as I did. Which is why I would like to tell you the following which I needed to hear then.\n\n> Moral of the story:\n\n> 1. Failure at education system/college/school doesn't mean failure at life, if there is such a thing. There is no correlation. Our education system focuses on competition more than knowledge. It's outright bad.\n\n> 2. If you work hard and do what you love, you will be happy. Success is secondary and it will also happen. You will win solely because so few people dare to try. Just work hard.\n\n> 3. You have enough time to fail at multiple career options. Every failure is an opportunity to learn.\n\n> 4. Don't be afraid of failure. Embrace it as part of life. Life is a series of failures, punctuated by brief periods of time where things seem to be fine. The amount of success people have in a year fits into a magazine. Everything else that billions of people have done that year is considered failure.\n\n> 5. Nobody will believe in you for a few years. It's just how it is. Please believe in yourself and work hard.\n\n> 6. Don't end your life. At least give it 30 more years. Dekho, kya hota hai. Maje lo duniya ke. Life is fucking spectacular and there is so much to learn and do. Life will change so much in the next few years you won't be able to recognise yourself.\n\n> 7. Don't be ashamed of asking for help. There is nothing wrong with depression. It is a very natural outcome of the kind of society we live in. Hota hai. Sabke saath hota hai.\n\n> 8. If you notice somebody behaving odd, talk to them. Be kind. Stop judging others, stop judging yourself.\n\n> 9. Don't do drugs. Just fucking don't. They will ruin your life.\n\n/** Source: Biswa Kalyan Rath's recent FB post **/""",63gmab

Has anyone here got refund by consumer court?,RealPhiLee,1485762698.0,425,AskIndia,self.india,"'Has anyone got a refund by taking a case to consumer court?\n\nHey guys! I bought an HTC device, specifically the HTC 10 with the intention of keeping it for 2+ years. The problem is this, the device has a unique display problem with the initial batches of the device, the colors straight on looks yellowish and from sides look full pink. It\'s called the HTC 10 pink tint issue. It\'s quite widespread. I have been struggling to make the customer service understand that this is not normal. I have even threatened them with consumer court, that\'s when they finally admitted my device is at fault. But you know the funny part? They won\'t repair it, they say they\'ll improve the next generation. Note that the problem is faced by a small minority of people who bought the device early and not many HTC 10 owners suffer this issue. I can\'t possibly understand how they can ignore this fault and say, ""we\'ll improve it next time sir, please spend 50k more next year"" wbout my current device? I paid so much for quality and they say they can\'t do anything about it?! \n\nThe display defect, my device is the black one and the one with the proper display is the white one, both are HTC 10, when I showed the customer service why this is, they said it\'s cause the model is white(what?!,so if I bought the same HTC 10 in white color, I wouldn\'t have this issue?) I sent the ""escalation team"" the video proof and they said they can\'t find ANY difference in the quality of the screens! The white models display also has a higher refresh rate! The video: https://youtu.be/_RP-XeL3JiQ\n\nI have all the proof to back up my claims including them claiming my device has a display defect and they can\'t do anything about it, has any one of you approached the consumer court and got justice? I\'ve clearly been given a inferior product and the company has been ignoring this problem for a long time. The problem is very famous with android central, android authority writing articles about this particular problem on the HTC 10. The HTC 10s in USA with the same problem get replaced over there and in India I get the reply ""we\'ll do better next time, buy our new flagship""\nHow can I get my money back? \n\nPls help randians. \n\nEDIT 1: A person in India got replacement for the same pink tint issue on the same exact device(HTC 10). They replaced his and they refuse to even consider my problem. Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5qzfjt/has_anyone_here_got_refund_by_consumer_court/ http://imgur.com/i2ASuwF \n\n\n\nEdit 2 : 22hrs and 5500+ upvotes later, no action or contact from HTC. Seems like court is the way to go. Little caught up in my exams, so can\'t do it swiftly, hope HTC has a solution ready or they\'re gonna get their asses whooped. \n\nEdit 3: Android authority has an article on this problem! Link: http://www.androidauthority.com/htc-10-problems-fixes-702228/\n\nEdit 4: another site has specified the pink tint issue\nhttp://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/htc-10-problems\n\nEdit 5: someone from Reddit is helping me taking HTC to the court, hopefully they respond.

[NP] How can I take Airtel to consumer court?,anonlerker,1485486180.0,412,Non-Political,self.india,"'In the last month, I\'ve noticed that Airtel has changed the wording of data packs for pre-paid connections to very tempting prices. The packs are worded like ""INR 157 for 4 GB 4G data"". No other information is provided till AFTER you buy the pack.\n\nAfter doing the recharge, I see something 450 MB 4G data in account A and the rest in a 3G account. This means, that the phone gets locked to 3G, the data from the 3G account gets used. After it is exhausted, the phone is allowed to connect to 4G and then use the data from the 4G account. (pre-emptive answers.. yes, its a 4G phone, yes I\'ve allowed it to use all bands)\n\nIf it matters - I\'m in the Bangalore/Karnataka circle and manage my data SIM cards using the Airtel app.\n\nIs this not crafty and false advertising? They\'re clearly pulling these stunts to stave off people from going to Jio, but this is really pushing the limits. What\'s more perplexing is that the ""regular"" packs have become even more expensive. There\'s no cheap data like before. Everything is like ""purchase a 650 rupee plan and that gets you 1 GB of data at 100 bucks per month for the next 6 months"". Or, ""150 bucks for 1 GB of data for 2 days"". WTF???\n\nIs there some sort of complaint process any one knows? Email of some higher up? Tweeting at them doesn\'t seem to make a difference at all. \n\nAnyway, my little rant aside, how can I take Airtel to consumer court to fight these utterly shitty anti consumer practices?\n\nThanks for any advice. \n\nUpdate: Apparently, one can\'t take a mobile co to consumer court because of Justice Markandey Katju. /u/Xerxesatg1 Pointed that out.

"Real Life WhatsApp, need your help. [NP]",_2_4_8,1480999056.0,403,Demonetization,self.india,"'I was at the ATM this morning and it was quite empty, no line or anything. The reason was probably that the ATM only had 2000 rupee notes. As I make my withdrawal and come out with the note, I do so while smelling this note. I have a habit of smelling fresh minted money, so I do so. \n\nThis guy in his 40’s, who looked like an office goer that was standing outside the machine to make a withdrawal, notices me. And he asks *“Iss se kiya asli hai malum ho jata heh?""* [By doing this (smelling notes) you know if note is real or fake?] I am like \'what?\' Then he begins to ask me the question more formally or so to say ‘inquiringly’. Now I wanted to explain to him that smelling notes is my thing, but I wondered if he’d think that I am a freak. So I just nodded and said *“Yes, Yes”*. As I am standing in the road for a bus, and the ATM machine was just right next to the road, this same guy comes to me and asks me to smell his 2000 rupee note. I am like \'wtf?\' Now I just take his 2000 rupee note, bring it to my nose, give it a strong whirl and sniff real hard. And I say, *“Yes, this is the smell of real money”*. The guy then takes the note from me, and starts sniffing it like crazy. Like a dog who found a bitch’s scent and tries to acquaint himself with it. Another passerby notices this guy and comes to inquire about it, upon knowing about it, he too rushes into his wallet and takes out fuckin 2k and hands it to me for smelling. I do so, his note is not that fresh but has the same scent. These two morons, as they are sniffing, act really happy with it. As if they know something and others don’t. My bus arrives and as I am getting on it, as a go away gift (like as Batman gives his toy to Kid Joffrey in Batman Begins), I tell them to spread the word so that people don’t get cheated. And these two wave at me like I am the fuckin messiah, both screaming *“Yes, Yes, Hain, Hain”* like a B-grade pornstar. \n\nPeople forward whatsapp without an ounce of thought. It is time we all learn a lesson! Someone in the early 2000’s decided to wear his pants below his waists, and the next thing you know, everyone is wearing them like that even though it made walking harder. Soon, low waist jeans started popping, the ones where when you squat, your ass crack is visible.  \n\nSo here’s what I want you to do, like those viral UNESCO blunders, I want you to smell your 2000 rupee note every time you take it out of the ATM or when someone hands you one that is quite fresh. And when people ask you, you tell them what I told those two morons, or make up your own story, and soon, we’ll have a country sniffing notes. And when this becomes a nationwide phenomenon, two things will happen. \n\n* A) Govt. will chest hump that like that beggar swipe machine, or \n\n\n* B) They’ll launch an initiative to tell people that sniffing notes to know the authenticity of it is a stupid idea. \n\nEither way, a gruesome lesson needs to be taught.

Watch here: [https://youtu.be/Im8cC3w7VZw?t=2860](https://youtu.be/Im8cC3w7VZw?t=2860)\n\nThe cost of the LED bulbs has come down drastically since 2010 because of their nature, much like how the cost of computers came down when Moore\'s law was in effect.

[Rant] We need to have well-behaved immigration officials or atleast a way to report their rudeness.,UghWhyDude,1486125622.0,394,Non-Political,self.india,"'I just got off a long-haul flight at about midnight today (CDG -> BOM), and I was appalled to see some of the rudest immigration staff I\'ve ever seen.\n\nSome poor Eastern European lady (who was clearly here on a vacation) had some trouble filling out those shitty customs forms (the ones that are so poorly designed they can never really hold the full information being asked) and the man at the counter (#18) was being an absolute shitlord. ""DO YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH?!"" He was bellowing at her, while this woman was just gibbering and struggling for a response, as he yelled at her to get away and find someone to fill out the form. After I finished my immigration check (from an equally rude officer) I went up to her (she was just standing to the side, looking utterly helpless and bewildered and nobody was helping, while the man already started handling the next person in line), helped her out, filled out the form, told one of the jawans standing there to go call one of the two ""ushers"" standing at the head of the line (directing people to the right line) to help her, because she needed assistance. \n\nWhat in the actual fuck, is this how we want to present our country as a tourism hub? I\'ve traveled fairly extensively and outside of some particularly dour-faced but still professional immigration officers in Berlin, I\'ve been faced with nothing but smiles and courtesy, even from the TSA in the US (despite all the horror stories). Some of them are even happy to chat (The memory of a big, mustachio-ed French officer saying ""Aap kaise ho?"" in heavily accented Hindi with a big grin on his face comes to mind). At Dulles, they even have a big board up in the lines leading up to the immigration hall which state that their goal is for their staff to be the first friendly face you see when you make it to the US and mission statements to the effect that happy TSA officers are their mandate. \n\nIn our case, it\'s some *sarkaari chut-nandan* yelling at a lady about her English comprehension. Utterly shameful, and I wish there was a way to report this sort of behaviour. '",5rtp8k

India: A country where the poor get ripped off by their own,envenomedaccountant,1508067206.0,394,Non-Political,self.india,"""This is going to be a rant. I am listing three incidents that occurred with my house maid during the past months which cemented my belief that in India, if you are poor, you are most likely commercially uninformed, and people will take advantage of you at each and every walk of everyday life.\n\nA background about my maid (let's call her 'Neeta'):\n\nNeeta worked full-time for my grandparents when we moved from the US to India. She had a daughter and lived with her mother and three younger unmarried sisters in the nearby slums. Neeta had left her alcoholic husband after 8 months of marriage. The husband's family stripped her of her gold bangles and her *mangalsutra* before letting her daughter go with her. Neeta's father died of a heart attack induced by a potent mix of beedi smoke and desi daru which he exposed his ~~lungs~~ body to daily; leaving his eldest ~~sister~~ daughter (aged 22 at the time of his death) to fend for the family.\n\nAfter my grandfather died, we cut back her hours and reduced her duties to a couple of hours a day. To compensate for the loss in her income, my father got her a job at the cable manufacturing company his friend owns.\n\nNeeta now works two jobs which together net her about 12k per month, which means that she can now save around 2k per month, with her sisters chipping into the household each month.\n\nHowever, the flaw that Neeta has is that she is poor. Being poor is a flaw in her world. Being poor means that she did not graduate high school. All her life she has lived in a neighborhood where gossip is news and rumors are fact. She is more susceptible to misinformation and much less likely to fact-check everything she hears or sees from anyone. At each corner, there is some person waiting to make as much money off of her misery and ignorance as possible.\n\nThe following three incidents in the recent past disgusted me about the audacity of the 'small businessman' or 'common man' in these cases:\n\n1. **The tire incident**: Neeta gets around on a TVS Scooty Pep which she tries to keep in good condition. One fine day, her tyre gets punctured and she wheels the scooter to the mechanic whose shop is just 50 meters away from the puncture site (coincidence?). Seeing her plight, he tells her that the tyre tube needs changing and it will cost her 600 bucks. After some negotiating, he accepts a price of 500, where her says he is breaking even, but agreed to do it because she is from the neighborhood. Guess what, the price of a tube is close to 200 (different brands vary in prices) and i cannot imagine labor charges more than 50. She paid him 500 because she thought that people from the neighborhood look out for each other and would never rip her off.\n\n2. **GST**: The local grocer charged the customers 10% GST over and above MRP for a full month before the government started running ads warning the consumers. When people started asking him for their money back, he said he paid it to the government.\n\n3. **Loan Sharking**: Neeta got a bridge loan from the biggest businessman in her neighborhood (read: goonda) at 24% interest to fund her daughter's tuitions. Her intention was to pay it back to him as soon as her workplace approved the loan to her, which was at a much lower interest rate. Her loan was approved in a week and she went to payback the *businessman*, he demanded a full year's interest from her. Also, he insisted that he never allowed anyone to pay him back the principal within 1 year. He refused to release the collateral and she had to pay him a year's interest for using the money for a week and a half.\n\n\nIt makes me sad how people are swindled by the very people they expect to have their back. Nobody cares anymore. People will gladly steal food from your plate to feed themselves, even if that means you will go hungry. I have lost all faith in this country's so called 'common man' who lacks empathy and just wants to consume as much as he can lay his hands on.""",76ih5d

On the phone, he told Anika he wouldn’t be able to come. “But it’s just a shutdown, and he should make it,” she protested to her mother.\n\nAt around noon on 28 February, Anika called her grandfather again. “Have you not started?” she asked him. “Beta, the situation is not good here,” Jafri answered. “There are mobs everywhere.” He told her he needed to put the phone down, since he had a lot of calls to make.\n\nA huge mob had already gathered around Gulburg Society, armed with petrol bombs, cycle chains and swords, shouting slogans like “Take revenge and slaughter the Muslims.” Many of Jafri’s neighbours, as well as Muslims from neighbouring slums, had come to his house seeking safety, expecting that his status as a former member of Parliament would afford them protection. “He must have made over a hundred phone calls for help,” Jafri’s wife, Zakia, told me. He called the Gujarat director-general of police, the Ahmedabad police commissioner, the state chief secretary and dozens of others, pleading for their intercession. A witness who survived the carnage later told a court that Jafri even called Narendra Modi: “When I asked him what Modi said, [Jafri] said there was no question of help, instead he got abuses.” Word of Jafri’s frantic calls for help even reached Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani in Delhi: a BJP insider close to Modi, who was with Advani on 28 February, told me that the BJP leader had even called Modi’s office himself to ask about Jafri.\n\nBy 2:30 pm, the mobs had broken through the gates of the housing society, and a flood of men converged on Jafri’s home. Women were raped and then burned alive; men were made to shout “Jai Shri Ram”, and then cut to pieces; children were not spared. According to records later submitted in court, Jafri was stripped and paraded naked before the attackers cut off his fingers and legs and dragged his body into a burning pyre. The official police report indicates that 59 people were murdered in Gulburg Society, though independent inquiries put the number at 69 or 70. Jafri’s wife, Zakia, and a few others who had locked themselves in an upstairs room survived.\n\nTo this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.\n\n“His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”\n\n“Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.\n\n“I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”\n\n\n* **His interactions with businessmen**\n\nModi was joined on stage by the heads of two venerable business families, Jamshyd Godrej and Rahul Bajaj, as well as the director-general of the CII, Tarun Das. If Modi expected a friendly welcome from Godrej and Bajaj, he did not get it. After recounting an incident from the previous month in Mumbai, when an Oxford University professor had heckled Modi at a public event meant to celebrate his election, Godrej called on Modi to use the mandate from his victory to ensure the safety and security of all Gujaratis.\n\nBajaj was even more outspoken: he began by declaring that 2002 had been a “lost year” for Gujarat. Looking at Modi, he asked, “Why don’t we get investment in Kashmir, the Northeast, or Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? It is not just the lack of infrastructure, but also the sense of insecurity. I hope this won’t happen in Gujarat—all this comes to mind because of the unfortunate events last year.”\n\nBajaj turned once again to Modi: “We would like to know what you believe in, what you stand for, because leadership is important,” he said. “You are today the undisputed leader of your party and government in Gujarat and we want to know you better …We are prepared to work with governments of all hues, but we also have our own views on what is good for our society and what works for it.”\n\nModi listened patiently to the torrent of criticism, silent but furious.\n\n“You and your pseudo-secular friends,” Modi roared at the leaders of Indian industry, “can come to Gujarat if you want an answer. Talk to my people. Gujarat is the most peaceful state in the country.” Tension filled the room. Modi continued, turning to Godrej and Bajaj: “Others have vested interest in maligning Gujarat. What is your interest?”\n\nModi carried his fury back to Gujarat, and quickly set about showing the CII who really had the upper hand. Within a few days, a group of Gujarati businessmen close to Modi—including Gautam Adani of Adani Group, Indravadan Modi of Cadila Pharmaceuticals, Karsan Patel of Nirma Group, and Anil Bakeri of Bakeri Engineers—had established a rival organisation, which they called the Resurgent Group of Gujarat (RGG), all of whose members threatened to withdraw from the CII on the grounds that it had humiliated and insulted Modi and all Gujaratis. The RGG issued a press statement swearing by the pride of Gujaratis, and demanded that the Gujarat chapter of the CII resign for “failing to protect the interests of the state”.\n\nFaced with an open revolt from a crucial state and its powerful business community, Tarun Das had good reason to worry: more than 100 companies from Gujarat were threatening to leave the CII, which would cripple the organisation’s presence in Western India; back in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government began to limit the CII’s access to its ministers, jeopardising the group’s core mission as a lobbying organisation.\n\nDas reached out to the BJP leader Arun Jaitley, then the Union law minister and a close friend of Modi, seeking to make amends. Over a two-hour conversation at his house, Jaitley quizzed Das on the CII and its intentions, and then told Das that he would raise the issue with Modi, who was expected to come home for dinner one day soon.\n\nA few days later, Jaitley told Das that the issue could be resolved: Modi wanted a formal apology from the CII. Das was eager to oblige, though not without some hesitation, as he later recounted in a long post-retirement interview with Business Today:\n\n“The evening I was leaving to meet Modi [to deliver the letter of apology], my wife accosted me, ‘You just can’t do this….’ Among our close friends are Anu Aga, Azim Premji, Jamshyd Godrej and several from the Parsi and Muslim communities. My answer was that I had two options: I could quit and say I will not do this. Else, I had to look after our members.”\n\n* **His Days at the RSS**\n\nThe pracharak related an incident that took place during the Emergency: “We in the ABVP were told to organise agitations against the government, from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, and one day we were holding a meeting at the Bhullabhai Char Rasta in Ahmedabad,” he said. “We were supposed to speak against the government, but in a sober tone, because that was the Sangh style, and also the police and the intelligence agencies were watching over us. But while the meeting was on, Narendrabhai passed by on a cycle. He was furious at the composed serenity in our protest. He jumped onto the stage, grabbed the mike and began giving a rabble-rousing speech, spitting abusive words, and not hiding his anger against the government.”\n\n“The audience loved it. But that night, at Hedgewar Bhavan, the senior Sangh leaders scolded Modi for his detrimental and unwarranted act—for a nearly-underground Sangh pracharak to come out in the open. ‘Forget about speaking,’ they lectured him, ‘you shouldn’t have even gone there. Even if the meeting failed, it would be okay, but discipline and obedience to one’s role is superior to all.’”\n\nFor all his allegiance to the Sangh and its ideology, the organisation’s structure and style—placing the group above the individual, restraining one’s anger, respecting the protocols established by the leadership—did not mesh with Modi’s personality.\n\nShankarsinh Vaghela, who was senior to Modi in the RSS and the BJP, and later became chief minister of Gujarat and one of Modi’s bitter rivals, recalled that even as a young man Narendra chafed at the strictures of the Sangh. “Modi used to miss the morning shakha quite often by sleeping late,” Vaghela said. “He always used to do things differently from others in the group—if all of us wore long-sleeved kurtas, he used to wear short sleeves, and when all of us wore khaki shorts, he wore white shorts. And I remember one day the visiting RSS leader Golwalkar questioning Modi in public for keeping a trimmed beard.”\n\n* **How his economic record in Gujarat**\n\nIn the wake of the 2002 riots, Modi skillfully painted any criticism of his government’s misdeeds as an attack on Gujarat and Gujaratis. Over the past few years, and with considerably more subtlety, he has achieved the same thing with the story of the state’s development miracle. The government has relentlessly provided the media with positive stories of efficient administration, rapid construction and economic growth.\n\nModi likes to flaunt the fact that Gujarat is a power-excess state, and almost every big-picture story about the “Gujarat miracle”, from Business Today to The Sydney Morning Herald, highlights this fact. But farmers, led by the Sangh’s own farmers’ union, have been protesting for almost a decade that their electricity needs aren’t being met, and government statistics show that the share of power diverted to agriculture has fallen from 43 percent to 21 percent between 2000 and 2010. More than 375,000 farmers are still waiting for electricity connections for their irrigation pumps.\n\nEven the headline figures for Gujarat’s economic expansion in the past decade diminish under closer examination. The state’s GDP growth has only slightly outpaced India as a whole over the past decade. But this is to be expected: Gujarat has long been an industrialised state—and in fact, growth rates under Modi are not significantly higher than they were in the prior two decades. Though Modi has presented Gujarat as the clear leader among Indian states in attracting foreign direct investment, it ranked fourth among states on this measure between 2000 and 2009, and in 2011 fell to sixth place, after Maharashtra, the National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh; Maharashtra has foreign direct investment inflows almost nine times greater than Gujarat.\n\nData from the Planning Commission, meanwhile, show that in spite of Gujarat’s economic growth, the state lags behind even Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in rates of poverty reduction. According to the 2011 India Human Development Report, Gujarat also scores poorly in several social indicators, with 44 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, worse than Uttar Pradesh.\n\nBy themselves, these statistics hardly constitute an indictment of Modi’s record. They merely suggest that his carefully constructed image as an economic miracle-worker has been the result of a well-managed public relations campaign whose false premise is that Gujarat stands head and shoulders above every other Indian state in growth and development—and that anyone who presents data to challenge this narrative is only twisting the truth in order to malign Modi and every Gujarati.\n\n* **How he deals with opponents inside his party**\n\nAT THE TIME OF THE 2002 RIOTS, Gordhan Zadaphia was Gujarat’s minister of state for home affairs—junior to Modi, who also held the home portfolio—and like Modi, he stands accused of complicity in the violence. A VHP leader in Gujarat for 15 years, Zadaphia joined the BJP in the early 1990s. “The RSS told me to work in the BJP, and I became a general secretary for the party in Gujarat,” Zadaphia explained.\n\nHe is also one of three prominent leaders in the Gujarat BJP—all of them with impeccable Sangh credentials—who spoke out against Modi’s autocratic style within the party. The first, Haren Pandya, who had served as Modi’s revenue minister, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 2003. The second, Sanjay Joshi, who had become a general secretary in the national BJP, was forced to resign when a CD containing pictures of him with naked women—later determined to be fake—was anonymously circulated to top BJP leaders. And Zadaphia, the third, was pushed out of the cabinet by the end of 2002, and subsequently ejected from the party.\n\n“Modi understands only one alphabet, and that is capital I,” Zadaphia told me. “I was threatened with death by Modi himself.”\n\n“It was in February 2005,” Zadaphia continued. “I noticed an intelligence man from the state police following me, and when I confronted him, he told me he was instructed by the home minister’s office to shadow me.” A few days later, Zadaphia said, there was a meeting of BJP legislators with the chief minister. “I asked Modi in the meeting, ‘Narendrabhai, what kind of spy activities are you doing against your own party legislators?’ I asked, why is an intelligence man following me? Then Vajubhai Vala, a senior minister, took the microphone and said ‘Okay Gordhanbhai, cool down. We will look into it, but this is not a question to be asked now.’ Modi didn’t speak at all, but I got a note from his secretary that said ‘Please meet the CM.’”\n\n“I met him at his chamber after the meeting. [Deputy home minister] Amit Shah was sitting there. Modi asked me, ‘Why are you asking these kinds of questions in public?’ I said, ‘What shall I do? It is not a private matter.’ Then he looked sternly into my eyes and said, ‘Khatam ho jaoge Govardhanbhai…’—You’re going to get finished.’”\n\n“I asked him, what kind of finishing? Physically or politically?”\n\n“He said, ‘You complained against me to LK Advani and Om Mathur in Delhi.’”\n\n“I said, of course. There’s no option for me other than to complain to the people in Delhi. But if you’re saying you will finish me off, let me tell you, I’ll die when my time comes. Don’t try to threaten me again.”\n\nZadaphia moves around with a police escort and a dozen armed security men; as a former deputy home minister—and a controversial one at that—he was offered protection by the government after the riots. Pandya, however, did not have security guards. “Haren was bold,” Zadaphia said. “He thought nothing would happen to him. That was a mistake.”\n\nA tall and handsome Brahmin with a fine RSS pedigree and excellent connections in the media, Pandya was a formidable political rival for Modi within the state BJP. The two clashed publicly for the first time in 2001, when Modi was in search of a safe assembly seat to contest after his appointment as CM. He wanted to run from Pandya’s constituency, Ellisbridge in Ahmedabad—a very safe seat for the BJP. But Pandya refused to yield to Modi’s wishes. As a state BJP functionary recalled, “Haren said, ‘Ask me to vacate my seat for a young man in the BJP—I’ll do it. But not for that fellow.’”\n\nIn May 2002, three months after the start of the riots, Pandya secretly gave a deposition to an independent fact-finding panel led by Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Modi could not have known what Pandya said, but written records show that Modi’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, instructed the director-general of state intelligence to track Pandya’s movements, and in particular those related to the fact-finding panel. The intelligence director took down the instructions in a register—the entry for 7 June 2002 reads as follows: “Dr PK Mishra added that Shri Harenbhai Pandya, minister for revenue is suspected to be the minister involved in the matter. Thereafter, he gave one mobile number 9824030629 and asked for getting call details.”\n\nFive days later, on 12 June 2002, there is another entry in the register: “Informed Dr PK Mishra that the minister who is suspected to have met the private inquiry commission (Justice VR Krishna Iyer) is known to be Mr Haren Pandya. I also informed that the matter cannot be given in writing as this issue is quite sensitive and not connected with the charter of duties given to State intelligence Bureau vide Bombay Police Manual. It is learnt that the telephone number 9824030629 is the mobile phone of Shri Harenbhai Pandya.”\n\nNews reports soon revealed that an unnamed minister in Modi’s cabinet had deposed before the Iyer commission, and described for the first time the meeting at Modi’s residence on the night of the train burning, at which Modi allegedly told his top police and intelligence officers that there would be justice for Godhra the next day, and ordered the police not to stand in the way of the “Hindu backlash”.\n\nThe leak provided sufficient evidence for Modi to press a case of indiscipline against Pandya within the BJP, and two months later Pandya was forced to resign from the cabinet. But Modi was not finished. The state elections were due in December 2002, and Modi saw an opportunity to deny Pandya the Ellisbridge seat that he had refused to vacate a year earlier. “Modi never forgets, and never forgives,” the BJP insider close to the chief minister told me. “It doesn’t help a politician to have such longterm vengeance.”\n\nAnd so Modi denied Pandya the constituency he had represented for 15 years. The leadership of both the RSS and the BJP objected and asked Modi to relent, but he refused. Near the end of November, RSS leader Madan Das Devi went to meet Modi at his residence, carrying a message from the RSS supremo KS Sudarshan, his deputy Mohan Bhagawat, LK Advani and AB Vajpayee: Stop arguing, don’t create division before the elections, and give Pandya his seat. Devi stayed late into the night, but Modi held his ground, the state party functionary said: “He knew he would start getting phone calls from [RSS headquarters] Nagpur and Delhi, since he did not listen to Devi. So that night, by 3 am, he got himself admitted into the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital for exhaustion and fatigue.”\n\nPandya, according to the party functionary, charged to the hospital to confront Modi. “Haren told him, ‘Don’t sleep like a coward. Have the guts to say no to me.’” Modi refused to budge, and the RSS and BJP leaders finally gave in. Modi left the hospital after two days, and handed Pandya’s seat to a newcomer. And in December, he came back to power riding the post-Godhra wave of communal polarisation.\n\nPandya, for his part, started to meet with every top leader in the BJP and RSS—in Delhi and in Nagpur—telling them that Modi would destroy the party and the Sangh for his own personal gain. Senior BJP figures, who still regarded Pandya as a valuable asset to the party, decided to transfer him to headquarters in Delhi as a member of the national executive or a party spokesman. “Modi even tried to scuttle that,” Zadaphia told me. “Pandya going to Delhi was going to be harmful for Modi in the long run.”\n\nThree months later, in March 2003, on the day after Pandya received a fax from the party president ordering his shift to Delhi, he was murdered in Ahmedabad. The Gujarat police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced that Pandya had been assassinated in a joint operation between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Dubai-based underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Twelve men were arrested and charged with Pandya’s murder, but eight years later, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acquitted every single one and rubbished the entire case. “The investigation has all throughout been botched up and blinkered,” the judge said. “The investigating officers concerned ought to be held accountable for their ineptitude resulting into injustice, huge harassment of many persons concerned and enormous waste of public resources and public time of the courts.”\n\nPandya’s father, Vithalbhai, has publicly accused Modi of ordering his son’s killing, and moved a petition in the Supreme Court calling for the chief minister to be investigated, though the court dismissed it, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nRB Sreekumar, who headed the state intelligence for a year soon after the riot, told me that he had been asked by the chief minister’s office to regularly give details about the movements and activities of Haren Pandya.\n\n“I’m not saying Modi got Haren Pandya killed. I have no evidence. But the fact remains—anyone who speaks against Modi from inside the BJP gets finished either physically or politically,” Zadaphia told me.\n""",74v9rx

The least a government can do if it does not wish to “direct” Indians towards liberalism is to stay out of the way and let them determine for themselves how they wish to live.\n\nOther interesting part from that article : \n\n> ""I believe that we need to move India into a more liberal direction, in keeping with the values enshrined in the Constitution.

India: A country where the poor get ripped off by their own
"Are we all so naive?\n\nWhile AB promoting GST is questionable, equating the two is ridiculous. Do you think Shariff was removed for the Panama scandal? He had fallen out of the Army's favor for sometime and the army was looking for some pretext to remove him. It just so happened that Panama papers happened at the same time. They could have found out 1000 other reasons to remove him if not the Panama Papers."

"Since the disqualification of NS, I keep wondering if Pakistan's legal system is less corrupt than India's legal system. \n\nPeople like Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia, Modi, Salman Khan, Baccha's got out and the PM of Pakistan, his family and most of the senior leadership is disqualified for life from politics. Will we ever see this in India. \n\nDid Indira Gandhi and subsequent leaders have weakened the judiciary system so badly. \n\nI hope one day our courts will have tooth again. "

'Another reason why this is Randia\n\nAs far as I know, Bacchan\'s role in Panama papers is yet to be confirmed.\n\nAs for Sharif..\n\nYou first need to know that Pakistan is a military nation. The only reason why Nawaz Sharif was "democratically elected" was because he licked Gen. Raheel Sharif\'s @!#%&. Nawaz was corrupt, the military is bloodthirsty rapist shitfaces. The military coming to power again will surely trigger a war between India and Fuckistan.\n\nPanama papers was just an opportunity.\n'
"The fact that your pakistan is already in abyss doesn't make any difference even if you don't have a government, India on the other hand is agreed to have criminals as government, by it still has achieve economic growth, and it needs a firm government. So it's a fragile situation in India when you say Supreme Court has to make quick decision. I agree we are wrong, but that wrong has put us in a desperate situation. "

This case was heard in supreme court for  a couple of months ,after which an investigation team was comprised which was to give it's report in 60 days to supreme court. All parties were heard and there ruling was based on an exhaustive investigation. \n\n2. No judges were representatives of intelligence agencies. You might be confusing judges with the investigation team where 2 members out of 11 were of intelligence agencies. \n\n3. This case was started because Panama papers, but yeah your point is valid. \n\n4. Things change as do institutions. Just because these courts havnt been impartial before doesn't mean we question them forever. The courts are comparitively impartial now. \n\nThe worst side of this judgement would be the article of law this ruling is based on which is vague and ambiguous. This ruling can lead to multitude of farce political cases. \n\nNothing is black or white. Labeling this ruling not good for Pakistan is a bit of a stretch."

It's incredibly stupid to even bring this up."
"You're confusing cryptocurrency with the underlying technology of blockchain.\n\nBoth are two different things. Blockchain is a distributed record which is not editable after a transaction has been recorded. Any changes that need to be made will be required to go through all the people in the chain (which will be impossible). So every single edit will be recorded and transparent.\n\nFor eg - through a proper blockchain you will be able to see the entire chain of subsidy allocation by the govt. right down to the very officer who disburses the subsidy to the end user. Corruption will 99% be eliminated. Everything will be open to the public.\n\nBlockchain will replace the way governments will govern us. They will oppose it because they will lose all their power by hiding behind opaque laws and voluminous procedures."

"The poor always gets ripped off, and in multiple ways. Since you mention kirana stores, when malls and big departmental stores cropped up, there was a huge hue and cry that they were taking business away from the friendly neighbourhood kirana stores. Although this is true, no one talks about the flip side of kirana stores. Their storage is abysmal, what with rats and all; their goods could be adulterated (for example, sugar), and poor in quality without necessarily costing that much lesser; they give preferential service to big/rich customers (especially in small towns, both the rich and the poor buy from the same store); they rip off customers whenever they think they can get away with it (for example, the poor and the very young customers). You'd be surprised to know that the poor would be paying more for the same items that you pay less in a big departmental store. Why do the poor still buy from such kirana stores? Because 1) they get intimidated by big departmental stores 2) they cannot buy half kilo rice or quarter kg sugar in such stores.\n\nThis is just one example of how the poor are robbed. \n\nWhy do you think pawn shops are more in poorer neighbourhoods? They are easy pickings. \n\nThe poor are not poor in just money, they get everything less, too, in both quality and quantity. \n\nEdit: typo and added some lines"
'Poor uneducated villagers get screwed around endlessly. A maid I know of worked at a home for 3 years, and was not paid for those 3 years of work.\n\nBanks in the villages try to cheat these people as much as they can. Examples are there of them taking the money and not actually depositing it in the account.\n\nHave heard enough horrific stories, and not old ones. These are all recent. Being poor is a sin, and a grave sin in India. '
'Why do you expect the goonda to have her back? He is a goonda for a reason. Also I am pretty sure the mechanic would have charged you at least 500, if not more. The rich and the poor are exploited alike. I feel like this is not something common to India. I have been living in the US for more than an year now and I have experienced financial exploitation as well.'
'>Nobody cares anymore\n\nThis is not new. The common man has been romanticised in the media but he has never cared. Everyone in india is out to scam you and there is no concept of the collective good. This should not be news to you or to anyone, for that matter.'
"India is a poor country. All poor countries are tough countries. To survive and thrive, you need to be tough, street smart, and have a great deal of awareness and good judgment. You need to be able to fight for your rights aggressively when needed.\n\nThis woman's problem is not being born poor or born in India. Her problem is she was not willing to fight for her jewellry. She was not aware of how much a basic puncture costs while she drives a 2 wheeler every day. She was not aware of the repercussions and terms and conditions for a money lender loan. She has led a sheltered life because she was lucky to have a good family who sheltered her from most things.\n\nI am not at all saying blood sucking leeches do not exist. But please don't use poverty as some catchall blanket excuse. Or even lack of education. Or overpopulation. Which are standard rants on this sub.\n\nOne can be street smart and aware and informed and not get taken for a ride while still being poor and even uneducated. It is harder but not impossible. All those villagers? They are not fools, despite what you might think. They might be unaware of many things, yes."
"In addition to your incidents, I think really bad life choices and decisions IMO are the major reason why the poor remain poor. I give you 2 incidents from my life.\n\n1.My house maid was married at a very young age, and is also much younger than me (I'm 26), and she has a son who goes to a very good private school (which incidentally was the same school that I studied). He is sent to the school based on the government's RTE scheme but she is left to fund his other expenses of school. Her husband was / is a drunkard and often beats her or steals her money. He doesnt earn and only comes home occasionally to steal the money from her. She also has some court case going against him in their village. \n\nBut the interesting part is she constantly takes salary from my mother in advance of every month, spends on her vehicle's petrol, travel expenses to her villages, religious celebrations etc. She travels to her village atleast twice every month, and later complains of no money for her son's school fees. Is she not the one making very bad decisions and making her own life more difficult than it already is?\n\n2.A poor woman (in her 40s I think) walked upto my house one morning with her cow, singing some songs begging for food with the pretext of me getting blessing from the cow. (Cry me a river, for I am an atheist). But I gave / donated to her my morning breakfast of 3 idlies (honestly I dont like idlies and wouldnt eat them if it wasnt for my parents), and the next thing I see is her giving all the 3 idlies to the cow and she continuing to begg me for something else. I was so enraged that I just returned to my dining table to cool myself. I gave her the 3 idlies for her to eat, not for her cow. \n\n----------------------\n\nCry me a dime, but I am sick and tired of hearing people blaming others for their life problems (especially poverty). I understand that its difficult to get out of poverty, but if your own life priorities are not to get out of poverty and something else like cows and religious celebrations, you have absolutly no sympathy from me. You dont deserve any gov services which is funded by my tax money, if your own life choices or decisions keep you and your family in the same economic level. I can understand poverty because of injustice and corruption, but poverty is not always due to poor people being fucked over or oppressed by others. They have a lot to blame themselves for. My 2 cents. "
'India is a land of hyper emotional people who blindly trust others. A land where you would see several time divorcees who never learned their lessons, marriages running for the sake of a non existent society, the rich scamming the poor at every turn. The biggest ever scammer in India is still seen on tv mouthing inanities and blaming everyone but himself. You, the educated lot know he’s a lying thief but what about the millions of people who trust him? He sleeps peacefully at night when he knows well that he failed his jobs promise and people still expect a turnaround of sorts. We, the pathetic losers will vote this megalomaniac once again in the hopes that he will set things right. It’s a sad world for the poor. They can’t trust anyone. One from their ilk became the PM of a country, but little do they know that their lives have not changed an iota. It takes mental arithmetic that literally heats up your head when you count the expenses that have incurred under massive inflation, but how many poor people are willing to calculate it and call out this thief for what he did? None. They would rather pray to their God to save them. They have no saviour, no one when their money runs out. And run out it will. The thief has not done anything to advance their cause, to give them some leeway to earn more and provide a better future for themselves and their family. Instead all they get to hear is that he is a chaiwallah and he’ll speak to them one on one on the radio to remind them that he’s “with them”'

IMO, our problem should not be whether this happens only in India or elsewhere too; but that why is it happening here in the first place?\n\n>why would you hold the poor people of India to a higher moral standard than other folks?\n\nI am not. I am simply stating that there is a difference in the social structure of the middle class/upper-middle class and the poorer section of the society.

'1. I moved into my apartment last year and there was a really bad bed bug infestation. The property management company was supposed to take care of it since it was their fault.

No wonder we had another round of infestation in a few months and this time, we had to shell out 550$. Not to mention, we had informed them of this.\n2.

When you say you are not "street smart", it does not mean you have to be a shaana wheeler dealer. It means you know what is a scam and what is not. So when you say you do adequate research on the internet to see if something is a scam or not and thereby you safeguard yourself, you are by definiton, "street smart".\n\nI will still claim this has nothing to do with education and had everything to do with awareness and common sense and "having a good nose".

Hasan’s brother, Noor-ul-Ain is trying to figure out how much GST to charge for a sari in which they have used both polyester and cotton – a popular combination for cheaper powerloom saris.\n\nGST is complex, and the government has hardly made an effort to explain it to the affected parties. \n\n>Admitting defeat, Hasan appointed a chartered accountant in September. He will charge Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 to fill each form, a further burden on the strained resources of HAR Fabrics.\n\nThat's unnecessary overhead for small-scale business owners. A law shouldn't be that complex. \n\n>“The Central Government usually allocates about Rs 6,000 crores of susidies for the handloom sector every year,” said Behal, “ The money does not reach weavers anyway. It should withdraw this fund and exempt us from GST. Without that, the art of the Banarasi sari will die.”\n\nPeople do not want to fleece the country as you imply. They simply don't want a system which makes their life complicated. "

'> These julahas never paid a single rupee as tax\n\nFrom the article\n\n>Jamil Ahmed made Rs 1,500 in a week before GST. Now it is Rs 700.\n\nJulahas monthly income is too low to be taxed anyway. \n\n>whereas the truth is that these people never want to pay any tax and now are forced to do their business in white. \n\nGo and read the article. People are complaining about the complicated system and there are plenty of points in the article which illustrate this. '
"So you think saree weaving is a criminal operation, similar to drug peddling and prostitution? Is that what you are saying? Cuz prostitutes don't pay taxes as well, did they stop their business? Drugs have stopped getting consumed? What the fuck kind of ridiculous argument you have. You cannot stand their livelihood so you feel happy about them that they will now probably die of hunger? Isn't what Varanasi used to be famously known for these people's hardwork, which ironically that asshole of a PM thinks it's better than Harvard? And how do you know they aren't paying taxes? Isn't that's the sellers job to do it?"
'So, media should stop questioning based on a hypothetical scenario in the future? '
"Oh you mean like the big boys such as Adani who can bribe their way out of any trouble? It's not about industry, it's about connections and the capability to bribe. Nobody is against GST, but what we wanted was a single-rate GST with minimum hassle. That's not what we got."
">Problem is most of them never really paid any tax before.\n\nwhich is good.  if they didn't pay taxes, they used it to run their business and feed their kids.  in the process, they generated employment for themselves and others.\n\nnow, once you squeeze the last ounce of blood in the form of taxes from them, can you or the government guarantee them employment?\n\nevery rupee I spend, I spend with 100% efficiency.  every rupee govt spends, it spends with 15% efficiency - ie., only 15 p out of every rupee govt spends reaches people.  rest goes down the black hole of bureaucracy and corruption of big government.\n\nit is one thing for the government to act all outraged over people not paying taxes if the govt, itself had its act together.  \n\ninstead, we have the most inefficient, most corrupt, most unethical, most dishonest, most criminal section of society (govt and politicians) holding forth on ethics of people paying or not paying taxes.  and we have semi-literate teenagers on this forum with no real-life experience acting morally and mortally outraged at the proposition.  wtf."
"This,so much this. I giggle to think what would happen if they introduced gst for farmers. Man, it would be a shit train to end all. I m a  slow guy but still I m a post graduate and I have fuck all idea about what gst is, thank God I m in farming sector so I m spared of all this. But I know  my pesticide  vendor having a meltdown.\n\n\n Seriously, wasn't gst implemented to simplify life ?  I can laugh because I ain't affected yet, but for many not so rich guys, it may get pretty bad. "
'> Julahas monthly income is too low to be taxed anyway.\n\n> Go and read the article.\n\nWhy are we talking income tax in a article about sales tax ? You are asking folks to read the article, but are yourself unclear about revenue, income tax and sales tax ...'

'Not just politicians, we the citizens are just as corrupt, we just turn a blind eye to our corruption.'
"No we don't have capital for anything. Nothing gets sanctioned here. "
"> Oh you mean like the big boys such as Adani who can bribe their way out of any trouble?\n\nSource? And even if this is true, employees for such companies would be paying income tax,EPS,etc. Which are taxes not applied to black money industries. That discrepancy should not be there. \n\n> Nobody is against GST, but what we wanted was a single-rate GST with minimum hassle\n\nI agree\n\n> That's not what we got\n\nI agree\n\nMy point was, if GST (or any percentage based tax) is applied, it should be applied on the entire industry. The govt should not allow the unorganized sector to operate in black while the organized sector is forced to be in white. "
'Do your research. Stop being such a bhakth'
'Its not an income tax but an indirect tax. Asking a society to be tax compliant is not wrong.\n\nPeople in India have no interest in knowing the laws. How often have you seen folks flout traffic lights or inch ahead of pedestrian crossings or ignore right of way.\n\nGST seems to be a problem because people are being forced to understand the law or get a CA to do it for them. Enforcement of indirect taxes is however not a bad thing!'
"Customers dont want to pay taxes. Ask any small business runner. Anytime an item gets costlier,people buy it less or not at all. Simple. Doesn't matter if its the tax hike or production costs hike. So in any case its the dukandar who suffers the most."
'> replacement tax can cause upwards price revision of 20% which is even more than the GST rate on those goods.\n\nIf only you\'d read the article or the quotes in the comment you\'d replied to, you would have figured out that compliance with GST costs money: for example, "Admitting defeat, Hasan appointed a chartered accountant in September. He will charge Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 to fill each form, a further burden on the strained resources of HAR Fabrics."\n\nNow, how many forms does one have to fill out, and how frequently? How much does the time spent on all this running around cost that small business?\n\nUnless you have those numbers, your accusing them of cheating amounts to prejudice.'
'It is bad. This kinda shit is going to wipeout small mom and pop businesses. Making way for the corporates to takeover.'
'But they got insane amount of freebies from the government. Insane amount. Watch the Adani documentary from 4corners. \n\nPatanjali is worse. '
'> GST is not Income Tax.\n\nno, its worse, its no income and all tax.'
">Not paying tax is punishable by law just like selling drugs.\n\nOh really!? Shit I didn't know that. But what I asked you was something different. Do you think saree weaving business or any small scale Craftsmen are criminals, because they still get less of a wage when they sell it to the retailer, just like how farmers get no value when they sell it to the middle men."
'> Gst is not a modi idea. \n\nIn fact he called it a terrible idea when he was in opposition.'
'Lol, don\'t worry about my high school learning, I did better than you while studying in vernacular medium, back when education really meant education, not business. You compared them with criminals when you said they don\'t pay taxes, but you missed a point that these Craftsmen are labourers, and the retailers that sell these goods actually cannot afford such a massive GST which the application is a crime in itself. They cannot suddenly come under the lenses of crime because they already do pay taxes one or the other way, it\'s just that you want them to pay more up until they have no earnings at all. That\'s the sadistic mindset you and this government has. Your saying this is the same voice of that poison party in itself. They spare the rich but are expecting these poor class to pay more than they can afford. That\'s snatching livelihood but, rich fuck mindset like you will always pin down others and think on a douchebag level that only your argument is so called "educated." It\'s people like you who are blot to this nation which is going through hard times without their fault.'
'Did you mean to reply to somebody else? Should I feel bad that you called me a Bhakth? I identify myself is an anti-bhakth though.'
'Hey, I think we should stick a censor in every house, and an accountant in every firm - \n\nObviously, at that idiotic level, the issue is obvious.\n\nWhat you, and a lot of other people, are hopefully going to finally realize, is the sheer hypocricy of India.\n\n\nIf you are a starving, marginal strength person, what happens when you land up trying to do weights?\n\nYou collapse.\n\nThats whats happening.\n\nTheres a lot of businesses which are not viable, in a regulated environment.\n\nYou are worried about "who will pay taxes", what you **should** be worried about, is how many MORE taxes you now have to pay, to be able to deal with those people who now are NO long productive members of society.\n\n\nSee, I don\'t get how you, and the rest of the so called educated middle class and elites, missed this.\n\nRegulations are not a magic wand. They need to be affordable, or else they just kill business. \n\nEven something like GST, which is supposed to help, can end up being a strait jacket.\n\nWhat is now clear, is that the old process, of slowly expanding the tax remit, was the correct way. \n\nSorry, to be honest you aren\'t the target of this. Its just annoying, that we had to elect a government to give people exactly what they want, to show how poorly it works. '
"> He will charge Rs 5,000-Rs 6,000 to fill each form, a further burden on the strained resources of HAR Fabrics.\n\nIts a good thing clueless people are reading this article. I'd laugh a fucking CA out of my office if he charged 5k for 'a form'."
'About the service charge thing, almost all the restaurants I have been to in Bangalore, have put a board outside saying "We charge service charge" and they say if you have a problem with that don\'t eat here.'
'I am going to play the devils advocate over here and put this up: \n\nA quote from the president of National Restaurants Association of India = "Guidelines on service charge not law" \n\nSource: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/58341250.cms\n\nTurns out he is right: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=156064\n\nThis has been misinterpreted and voiced everywhere. '
'but there\'s no direction to strictly NOT pay service charge either.."optional" doesn\'t mean anything..if a restaurant is charging, you can\'t deny that. Only thing Consumer Affairs deptt has said is- *"..consumers should be informed about service charge in the menu card itself and not in the bill"* and, *"..should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining experience, he/she can have it waived off."*'
">Don't be ashamed\n\n easier said than done"
"If they've made an entry in the bill for service charge you will have to pay GST on it. GST is a tax on goods and services. Nothing to see here. If you don't want to pay the service charge don't eat there. "
"This guy is talking through his ass. I'm in the F&B business. GST, just like all other taxes and levies before it, is on the total amount that includes bill + service charge. Go talk to a chartered accountant."
"From Bangalore itself, you can show them the notification from the government that says service charge isn't mandatory. \n\nI've asked for a revised bill without a service charge as I tip based on service. Not 10% flat. \n\nI usually tell this to them after I've finished eating and before I've asked for the bill. \n\nI often do this everytime the bills are more than 5k. I don't think its worth to pay someone 500 bucks to do their job. i leave a 200-250 tip at max."
'>Almost all restaurants and pubs in Delhi have put hugh signboards at entry saying that by dining in there, you are consenting to service charge.\n\nNope. Putting a signboard does not mean you are consenting to anything. If i put up a signboard in my restaurant that you cannot sit on chairs does not mean you consent to it. This is a stupid argument. \n\nIf you enter a place which says "we levy service charge" you still have the right to not pay it. '
'Refuse to pay. Becuase no one can deposit VAT / Service tax on bills generated after 30th June. Most likely scamming you.\n\nNote: Alchohol is not under GST so you will find VAT being charged on alcohol. '
"What the Fuck do you eat  to have bills more than 5k? \n\nEdit: I'm being downvoted for asking a genuine question?  Fuck off "
'your kirana walla is an idiot, or you are an idiot pick one, your choice.\n\nedit: downvote krke faida kya, fact of life, live with it.'
'that\'s one way of getting them to stop doing illegal things - if enough people do it - it\'s called a "boycott", or if you prefer American, "voting with your wallet"'
"That's such a retarded logic. I can always say I wasn't satisfied, even if I were to use this argument."
"Now you guys are just being silly lol... I understand you all hate service charge (I do too) but doesn't mean you all have to get all irrational. "
"You dont know the difference between Service Tax and Service Charge. You are agreeing to pay the restaurant for the food. They cannot force you to pay a tip. That is upon you. What if you got bad service? Will you pay a tip for a bad experience? Service Charge is an after charge which inflates your bill for no reason. \n\n>It's a free country and if the restaurant wants to charge a service tax and is upfront about it, then you pay or don't dine there. Simple.\n\nI can shit on the streets too by your logic. "
'To avoid calculations, AFAIK, flat 40% of restaurant bills are assumed to be service costs, while the remaining 60% is assumed to be goods while calculating taxes. '
'and it\'s not mine, tell this to Consumer Affairs Deptt not me, they\'ve clearly said(and i guess you can\'t read)-  *"..should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining experience, he/she can have it waived off."*'
'Restaurants reserve the right to entry. Even if you consent to their service charge, you are still within your rights to deny paying it later. What if you got bad service or bad food? Would you still pay? Service Charge is a tip. Remember this. '
'Which is precisely why you have the right to not pay service charge and you can deny it. '
"I am shopping from him since past half decade. That's how he knows. \n\n>If the retailer is letting go of that margin then he/she is an idiot.\n\nHuh? You have no idea how business is done."
'Service charge is not a tip lol. If it was, it would be called "Tip" not "Service Charge".'
'Why? Where did you consent to prices? \n\nAre clubs with an entry fees also merely a suggestion? \n\nIs "right to admission" also merely a suggestion?\n\nIs "No arms and ammunition" also merely a suggestion?\n\nIs "Not outside eatables" also merely a suggestion?'

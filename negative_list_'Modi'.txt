Beef Ban, Demonitsation, Swacch Bharat and Digital India - Modiji's all the achievements in one frame.
Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti is not acceptable: PM Modi
86% killed in cow-related violence since 2010 are Muslim, 97% attacks after Modi govt came to power
Case registered against actor Prakash Raj over his criticism of PM Modi
Arrested man made PM Modi remark on private Facebook chat
[Rant] Got harassed by traffic police. Digital India is a joke!
As a Muslim, I want to thank /r/india for condemning cow-based terrorism.
I am no more a bhakt !!
To protest against Modi, these Indians are cooking beef in public
[2015] I Miss Criticism: PM Modi
In the Name of Gau Bhakti They Killed Again in Modi's India
'Fucking funny, got the message 500 and 1000 banned on whatsapp from two people . Replied them did you fell for the whatsapp forward. Now I look dumb.     \n[Sauce](http://m.imgur.com/9fUIY75) (From another whatsapp forward, damn people are quick)'
'To all the stupid merchant outlets (KFC/McD) who have their card machines perpetually out of order. \n\nFucked.'
'My watchman is crying and freaking out as he just got paid with 500s and 1000s. Told him to calm down and that I would personally get his money exchanged. '
"Fucking hell, I'm not a Modi supporter, but the balls on this guy, wew lad!"
'Fuck me. Have around 50K at home in 500s and 1000s thanks to my ATM allergic parents. I have to go and get it changed soon. Also, fuck me again for paying 1600 as cash at a shop just 30 minutes back. All in 100s.\n\nOther than that, good move. Should have a heavy impact on low/mid level black money hoarders.'
'Major push!!!!!!! Modi does which everyone thought was impossible, people with money under their bed, you can now burn them, they are now worthless crap!'
"Oh boy converting your black money to white is gonna get costly. From 18-20% it'll increase to 30-40%. People are gonna regret not opting for income declaration scheme. "
'Man this is the most shocking and exciting thing that has happened in a really long time. Mr. Modi you have my vote for the next and next and next elections.\n\nFuck builders and tax stealing business guys. This is going to be epic. '
"I think this was a master stroke, I cannot believe this is actually happening! Also, the mass panic among some of my friends lists / statuses just tells me who are going to get massively fucked! I'm so enjoying this!\n\nEdit - \nOkay, I have a serious question as I have about 10k in cash and about 2k in wallet but I do have ATM receipt and bank withdrawal slip, would I be losing 12k for this?!"
'So I have 5000 INR as an NRI. Do I just lose it?'
"Summary of what Modi ji is saying\n\n- All Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will be obsolete from today midnight. No one will accept them from tomorrow\n\n- Exception to the above are essential medicines and hospital payments for next 72 hours. A doctor's note will allow you to use Rs 500\n\n- People traveling can use the notes to book tickets and at petrol pumps, crematarioum, burial grounds, etc\n\n- People arriving from other countries can get notes changed at the airport for up to Rs 5k\n\n- You will have from 9th Nov to 30th Dec to deposit the money into your bank with no limits. This means if you have cash lying around you can deposit all into your account and there is no limit for that\n\n- After 30th Dec, you can still exchange the notes with RBI till March 31st, 2018\n\n- Keeping in mind that the new cash will be limited, the amount a person can withdraw is Rs 10k at one time, and upto Rs 20k a week\n\n- For immediate needs, you can go to any bank or post office, show your ID and and change notes for up to Rs 4k\n\n\n- For the next few days, only Rs 2k can be withdrawn at the ATM. This will increase to 4k in few weeks\n\n- Bank and ATMs closed for 9th Nov. \n\n- This will not impact any electronic transactions, EFT, online, debit cards, credit cards etc which will continue as before"
'Half the people on news network today praising the development are worried sick about their own stash back home'
'On a negative side, the wedding season starts in two days. People who had withdrawn money in brand new notes of 500 and 1000 are proper fucked right now. Lots of cash required in Indian weddings, even if you are lower middle class.'
'My Point of View as a banker regarding this massive change in public transactions with so many new laws regarding cash.\n\na. Our all existing cash counting/fake detector machines at all banks will be rendered obsolete [the process of exchanging /dealing with it will be around some billions for sure and writing off the same will cause more redness in already loss making banks].\n\nb. ATMs will have to adjust with new dispensers of Rs 2000/- currency and new software/ATM service systems in a short span. The same have to be limited with new, shortened withdrawal limit.\n\nc. All branches will have to deal with massive line with massive cash to deposit whereas cash retention limit of all branches are quite low.\n\nd. The banks will have to ask details of the huge obsolete cash tenders from its already known customers who deal in black, which will cause further brand damage and fear of losing customers.\n\ne. Cashiers who have accustomed to check the current tenders will now have to relearn the new tricks/designs in new tenders.\n\nf. RBI yet to discuss/disseminate any concrete plan how it will dispense such massive cash outflow from its existing mints [which now has to implement new plates/machines for new series].\n\nPublic may suffer for short time but I think its it the banks in the economy who will have to pay a long bill in form of manpower/ asset/service/customer retention. Let us see how this craziness & chaos will fold out in upcoming days.'
'Brilliant triple game.\nFirst, try to open bank accounts for the poor with the jan dhan yojna. Then, try to give people a chance with the income declaration scheme. Finally fuck everyone else!'
'I have no clue about others but our business is fucked'
'This is bullshit. Oh wait.'
'what is Swacch Bharat?\nis beef really banned in India?\n'
'Beautiful. All this is missing is few dead anti-nationals'
'What would the offended call this post- Bull shit or Cow dung?'
'Holy Shit! '
"None of these are achievements TBH. Cows roam on streets, eat trash of dustbins but we consider them holy and thus can't eat them and yet India is one of the top beef exporters. \n\nDemonitisation was a big fail and the numbers say it all. \nSwacch Bharat isnt a success yet and thus not an achievement. I see more garbage, pollution and dust (on pavements/sidewalks) in the past couple of years. It hasnt really cleaned up. Im talking about National Capital Region as well. \nIts too early to classify digital India as a success especially when the whole Aadhaar issue is going on. It is more of an invasion of privacy and thus cant be an achievement yet. "
"I'm ashamed, just like I'm ashamed for a million other things that happen in India. Sigh.."
"This is why we can't have nice things"
'Swach Bharat is a campaign to instill cleanliness among Indian citizens, many here to think swach Bharat is govt cleaning up the mess you make.'
'Swach Bharat is for creating awareness. \n\nAnd that is an ATM, not the PMO of India.\n\nI guess India will always be retarded for centuries if people will keep blaming the government instead of themselves.'
"See the people living in this country don't want to work then what will modiji do in that. Lazy Ass Whiners. Probably Good for Internetting Only. "
'Cows produce methane gas far more dangerous than C02 from vehicles.\n\n#RIP ozone layer'
'No, we mock you because you people shit the same way this cow does.'
'Whining - Complaining without posing a Solution.'
"No filming destitute cows seeking shelter under PM's Gaaye Vigyaan Yojana"
"Hey, can you, may be, clean your mom's shit from the ATM floor?"
"Swachh Bharat means 'Clean India'. It was an initiative by the government that didn't work well(I'm no expert). The picture is mocking the situation in our country with an extended metaphor. The cow shit is a metaphor for the failure of Swachh Bharat. The shit in front of the ATM for Demonetization. I'm *overexplaining* things here, but the cow refers to the beef ban.\n\n\n\nYes. In some states.\n\nEither you live under a rock or you aren't Indian. I hope it's the latter."
'Shit dung'
"If the Swachch Bharat abhiyan fails, it's because it was misguided."
'Said someone whining at other people on the internet. '
'Wtf is internetting?'
'Right. Someone found a (presumably) non functional ATM, shepherded a cow into it, coaxed it to take a dump and clicked a picture of it... all for internet points.'
"The complete collection of tweets by the PM.\n- Today I want to say a few words and express sadness on some of the things going on: PM @narendramodi https://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/880329769660710913\n\n- We are a land of non violence. We are the land of Mahatma Gandhi. Why do we forget that: PM @narendramodi https://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/880329943816716288\n\n- No one spoke about protecting cows more than Mahatma Gandhi and Acharya Vinoba Bhave. Yes. It should be done: PM @narendramodi - https://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/880330540984881153\n\n- Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti is not acceptable.

'This inbred choothiya from SwarajyMag believes that PM speaking against GauRakshaks is a mistake : https://twitter.com/rahulroushan/status/880344163417559040\n\nJust how fucking retarded are these assholes.\n\n'
'Whether he really means it or not doesnt matter. What matters is that he has spoken out about the issue and people can no longer bury their heads in the sand about this.'
'This is latest lynching over beef after his speech. \n\n[Muslim man accused of carrying beef killed in Jharkhand, police says predetermined murder](http://m.ndtv.com/india-news/man-accused-of-carrying-beef-killed-in-jharkhand-police-says-premeditated-murder-1718626)'
'Foreign media has been taking this up seriously and looks like the PM was facing some embarrassing times during his foreign tours in front of other world leaders.'
"This is not good enough. He made similar statements after weeks of silence post Akhlaque Khan's lynching, but ground situation has not changed. He has to push the state govts (Rajasthan, UP, Jharkhand and more have CMs from his own party) for accountability and stop with the 'Pink revolution' rhetoric.\n"
"Finally, looks like the death of a teenager was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nHopefully, we will also see the PM follow through with his words and the Hindutva outfits who are murdering Muslims will be punished."
'This is essentially what he did in Gujarat right? Sit and watch shit happen then a half-hearted "that\'s enough yaar" when people notice.'
'If only he did something to stop it'
"The Washington Post writes about his silence on the matter and 24 hours later.....he issued a statement. What a ass. Looks like he doesn't want to deter investment and is trying to maintain an international image for his corporate overlords"
"Victory guys!!! We made our voice heard despite the Army of BJP supporters drowning it out - and mind you, this is just the first step!\n\nModi has been forced to speak out on this after 27 Gau Rakshak deaths mainly becasue this issue was tarnishing his image in the world stage! Yes, [protests across different countries](http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/notinmyname-india-countries-across-the-world-unite-to-silently-protest-against-mob-lynching-324796.html) under\n\n#\\#NOTINMYNAME \n\nforced Modi to talk on this issue! So Kudos to everyone who participated. In r/india, [such a protest was downvoted to eternity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6k0o0d/notinmyname_campaign_live_manish_sisodia_shabana/) and when I made a post to highlight such a callous attitude and cunning voting, my post was 'Reported' and removed!\n\nAnd let us hold Modi to tighter scrutiny so that he can't just make a statement & back off. Already he's made similar statements earlier but unless there is any credible action, it wouldn't matter much to these \n\n#\\#GAURAKSHASHAS!\n\nInb4 Why should Modi act? Because he was the one who chose Terrorist Yogi Adityanath, who created the group **[Gau Raksha Manch to Hindu Yuva Vahini](http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/the-rise-of-the-yogi-review-of-yogi-adityanath-and-the-hindu-yuva-vahini/story-vRNGApT8qCnAJGBaOyIvWK.html)** which has been behind many such lynchings. Secondly, his Top Dog, [**Amit the don Shah, who has links with such GauRakshashas!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag27L23o5yE)\n\nSo we need action against such people, his own partymen. Modi cannot wash his hands away now that he has acknowledged it - he has to act - act on those perpetrators and send a strong message that killing in the name of Gau Bhakti is indeed a crime!\n\nUntil then no respite!"
"Hi Mr.modi and his social media crew. You should have said something when the first or second crime was committed. And no point in issuing statements. Just keep your dog's in the kennel where they belong. And don't interfere with peoples diet. \nThanks \n"
'All they need to do is set up an example with a few serious arrests and convictions against these misdirected Gau-rakshaks.'
'How about some concrete action instead of empty bullshit that means nothing?'
'Immediate damage control once negative PR starts popping up in the foreign press. \n\nBetter late than never.'
"It's to late for this now, Pandora doesn't go back in the box, it only comes out. When you turn the heat up in terms of communal tensions the way Modi has on a pressure cooker of communal tensions like India, it's going to blow.\n\nModi not only normalized Hindi chauvinism and Hindu majoritarianism, he fanned flames between Hindus and Muslims, the 2 largest demographics in the country. \n\nNow he wants to try to lecture the fanatic base he has spent the last 3 years fostering and appeasing with appointments like Yogi as the CM of Uttar Pradesh? This strikes me as in incredibly disingenuous statement by Modi. "
'Feku just copypasta from last [August](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Cow-vigilantes-%E2%80%98anti-social%E2%80%99-Modi-breaks-his-silence/article14556739.ece). :D\n\nIn 2015 Yogi backed the mob that accused and lynched a person for eating beef. Said anyone who doesn\'t support it should go drown in a sea. Come April 2017 we read headlines like "Stop cow vigilantism, moral policing, or face action: Yogi to UP police".\n\n*Ya to hume andha aur behra samjha ja raha hai, ya to chutiya.* (Translation: Either the govt. thinks we are blind and deaf, or we are *chutiyas*.)\n\nBTW, what is the slang nickname for Yogi that\'s in fashion these days?'
'Great, now how about doing something about it instead of just turning a blind eye to them? '
"Whats the use. His words should match with action. I won't be happy unless those gaurakshak gangs are identified and treated on par with terrorists. These silly tweets will not make any difference to those families who lost their family members to these lynch mobs."
'How about putting those words into action? You can start with granting sanction to prosecution of bhogi adityanath for inciting communal violence, the case for which he himself has denied permission to prosecute himself.'
'He would have definitely addressed the issue *specifically*.\nBut unfortunately the hindutva goons and right wing morons and RSS would have made a big fuss '
'Spoken after getting cornered against the wall..\n\nBut spoken none the less..'
"Yeah, I never understood how people who want to claim the animal's life (whichever species you want to insert) and use death/ terrorism to drive their point home. \n\nSorry, if it meant extinction of chimpanzees to develop a cure to HIV/AIDS I would say buh bye bubbles. \n\nWhat is especially sad is that India is now the largest exporter of beef/beef products. And yet, people are being killed for allegedly consuming it?"
'    Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti is not acceptable. This is not something Mahatma Gandhi would approve\n\nSomeone tell him that the violent, stress on violent, gaurakshaks are not exactly fans of bapu. They hated him so much they killed him. '
'But killing for votes is acceptable to BJP. Shameless fellow.\n\nYour cabinet minister went and attended the funeral of a saffron thug draped in tri-colour '

'Someone else was murdered today, not even 24 hours since the exalted leader spoke.'
"Yesterday many in TV Media said that it was selective outrage to talk about only the lynchings that were committed by GauRakshaks. Why aren't they running stories on selective outrage by PM now?"
'Better late than never. I have always believed that Mr. Modi is extremely conscious of his image abroad. And I think his many a foreign trips off late, would have been a trigger. Also remember there is G-20 coming up. So time to take out the negative press coverage India is getting.'

"Wow, just wow. Now condemning murderers is a sign of weakness? Some time back asking for peace was criminal.\n\nThese dickwads have a really twisted sense of morality.

'Cows are just the facade ... this is not gautankwad. This is unemployed brainwashed Hindus hired as raiders, killers, and pillagers.'
"It's sad that it has started to happen even in Karnataka , South India , where historically there has been no major communal tensions ( except a few incidents ).\nIt is a sign that as a country where we are heading .\nOther countries are becoming more and more liberal and secular , whereas we are going backwards."
"A minister of Modi's cabinet went to pay his respects to one of the killers of Akhlaq (Dadri), father of an Indian Air Force employee. The body of the killer was draped in the national flag. What more evidence does one need to see that cow terrorism is state sponsored? If it wasn't Modi would have fired that minister."
'Honest question: When was the first occurrence of violence for cow-mata? I am trying to understand where this whole thing started.\n\nEDIT: I mean in the context of the present administration.\n'
"What people fail to recognize is that we're living in a constant state of riot. This is what's called death by thousand cuts. A full blown one off event would attract international infamy and be bad for business, so to avoid that but at the same time to 'show the minorities their place' cow is being used as an instrument. This is replication of 'Gujarat model' at the national level.\n\nWhat's tragic is that this protracted violence is extremely effective. Whatever neutral media outfits are left can report the same modus operandi, similar news only so much times before it becomes repetitive and loses it's effectiveness. People can show outrage only so much times before they too become callous and morally desensitized, one can't blame them either. All the lies, fake news and misinformation being spread requires exponentially more effort to counter than it takes to formulate and spread them. No wonder people will one day get exhausted of countering it too. That is exactly how the new insidious fascism works."
'The data collection method is extremely biased and cannot reflect reality. There may be more of these attacks *or* less of these attacks but any analysis based on this data is completely wrong. The data as presented is doing more harm than good. \n\n> Muslims were the target of 51% of violence centred on bovine issues over nearly eight years (2010 to 2017) and comprised 86% of 28 Indians killed in 63 incidents, according to an IndiaSpend content analysis of the English media.\n\n28 deaths in 63 incidents in over 8 years is *statistically* insignificant in a hugely populated country like ours. For comparison, [an average of eight people were killed daily on railway tracks in 2016](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crossing-tracks-led-to-1-798-of-3-202-train-fatalities-in-mumbai-in-2016/story-rGyKVyTRkn9VqiIqjw6CYI.html). \n\n\n\n>To compile the list of attacks centred on cow-related issues over the past eight years, we ran Google searches with keywords that included, ‘cow vigilantes’, ‘gau-rakshaks’, ‘beef’, ‘lynching’, ‘cow slaughter’, ‘cattle thieves’, beef smuggler’ and ‘cattle trader’. Where information was incomplete, we spoke to the journalists who filed the original reports.\nMuslim victims were identified by name. In 8% of the 63 cases, the reports explicitly stated that those attacked were Dalits, who are also targets because many among them clear cow carcasses, skin them and eat beef. In a few cases, religion was difficult to determine.\nIn 50.8% (32) of the cases, the targets were Muslim, in 7.9% (5) Dalit, 4.8% (3) Sikh or Hindu (names appeared Sikh, but it wasn’t certain) and 1.6% (one) Christian; in 20.6% (13) cases, religion was not reported. Among 14.3% (9) cases, the targets were Hindus, but their caste was not clear.\nPolice officers and onlookers were injured in 8% (5) of the attacks; 27% of those targeted were women.\nNote: This study was built around searches in English-language media and may omit cow-related violence reported only in Hindi and other language media. A cursory search through Hindi media appeared to throw up the same incidents.\n\nPS: NOT a gaurakshak, please put down your pitchforks.\n'
"Finally a statiatic. If it's authentic, and a fewore it can be used to take the case against the government  strongly.\n\nEdit: I take back my comment. It says based on English media. \n\nThat's a bad source. Fuck."
"I will be giving an unpopular opinion here, but anyway, let me go head and take the downvotes. \n\nThe report states 28 Indians have been killed in 7 years ranging from 2010 to 2017. Injured people amount to 124. \n\n[400 people](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/400-road-deaths-per-day-in-India-up-5-to-1-46-lakh-in-2015/articleshow/51919213.cms) die in India in road accidents every day. That amounts to 1.35 lakhs people dying each year. \n\nAround 30,000 students committed suicide in 2015, some people believe that these [stats](http://www.hindustantimes.com/health-and-fitness/every-hour-one-student-commits-suicide-in-india/story-7UFFhSs6h1HNgrNO60FZ2O.html) are heavily under reported. It seems to be among [highest](https://scroll.in/article/694364/four-charts-show-why-indias-youth-suicide-rate-is-among-the-worlds-highest) in the world. \n\n1.35 lakh [commit suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_India) every year in India. Men have 10% more chance in comitting suicide in India, and suicide rate has increased by 3 percent from 1980s to 2000. \n\nSure, some people would like to compare killing of cow vigilantes with terrorism, and not death by other causes. So lets go in there. \n\nThe article mentions 63 incidents in 7 years. US had 1094 [bias related](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election) crime incidents just after election, and that figure includes anti-Trump attacks too. Mind it, US has much lesser population than India and also stronger law enforcement. \n\n63 people had been [killed](http://time.com/4368615/orlando-mass-shootings-chart/) and 75 wounded in mass shootings in US in 2016 alone. Since 2010, 250 people have died. That's nearly 10 times people killed by cow vigilantes in India, and mass shootings in US is a hot topic for news. \n\nLet's go to peaceful Europe, shall we? \n\nRace and religious inspired hate crime rose by [41% in UK](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37640982). The numbers were over 5000. If you are looking at logic, that's a big jump. Sure, some people can argue Europe can have higher police reporting, but more than 20x reporting as in India, especially when even a brawl in train is given a beef angle by media? I highly doubt. \n\nLet's come to our home. \n\nBy fatalities, 158 people have died because of insurgency in [J&K alone](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/Cumulative_Fatalities.htm) this year.

'\n>>Of the 28 Indians who died over the seven-year period, 24 were Muslim, or 86%. As many as 124 people were also injured in these attacks. More than half (52%) of these attacks were based on rumours, our analysis found.\n>>In the first six months of 2017, 20 cow-terror attacks were reported–more than 75% of the 2016 figure, which was the worst year for such violence since 2010.\n>>Uttar Pradesh (10), Haryana (9), Gujarat (6), Karnataka (6), Madhya Pradesh (4), Delhi (4) and Rajasthan (4) reporting the highest number of cases.\n>>No more than 21% (13 of 63) of the cases were reported from southern or eastern states (including Bengal and Odisha), but almost half (six of 13) were from Karnataka. The only incident reported in the northeast was the murder of two men in Assam on 30 April, 2017.\n>>About half the cases of cow-related violence – 32 of 63 – were from states governed by the BJP at the time; 8 were run by the Congress, and the rest by other parties, including the Samajwadi Party (Uttar Pradesh), People’s Democratic Party (Jammu & Kashmir) and Aam Aadmi Party (Delhi).\n>>“Lynching does not find mention in the Indian Penal Code. No particular law has been passed to deal with lynching,” India Today noted on June 25, 2017. “Absence of a codified law to deal with mob violence or lynching makes it difficult to deliver justice in the cases of riots. However, Section 223(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 says that persons or a mob involved in the same offence in the same act can be tried together. But, this has not proved to have given enough legal teeth to (the) justice delivery system.”\n>>In a fifth of the cases, police registered cases against victims/survivors\n>>Of the 63 attacks over eight years, 61 (96.8%) occurred, as we said, after Modi’s government came to power (2014-2017), with 2016 reporting the most attacks: 25. In the first six months of 2017, 20 attacks were reported–more than 75% of the 2016 figure.\n>>In 5% of the attacks, there was no report of attackers being arrested. In 13 attacks (21%), the police registered cases against the victims/survivors.\n'
"The sanghis would have riots if they wanted to flair the communal tensions but that sort of thing can backfire against you with the sort of international backlash and attention it generates.\n\nLynchings are the perfect plan because if you kill one muslim per day, the number would never be high to generate outrage in the pro govt media channels. People and newspapers would mostly ignore or not play it as a much bigger issue.\n\nWith daily lynchings, there would come a time when this would be a daily occurrence, people would become apathetic and no one would care to ask questions. The govt would still continue to label every non bjp state as a mini pakistan and continue flair the resentment against mainorities.\n\nMake no mistake. Today it is muslims. Tomorrow they will come for sikhs by weaving an imaginary khalistani story and arnab and rahul shivashankar to sell it for them. When they'd be done with them then they will turn to christians and buddhists and dalits.\nAnd that will be the time, when the talibanization of this country would be complete when there will be no more imaginary liberals to bash and cows to milk, when the opposition would realise that only hindutva sells and they would reorganize their own strategies and rewrite their own manifestoes. That will be the time, Indians would be sorry that they never spoke out when there was still time."

Its goal was to eliminate the dangers placed on young girls who could not handle the stress of married life and avoid early deaths. This Act defined a male child as 21 years (originally 18) or younger, a female child as 18 years (originally 14) or younger, and a minor as a child of either sex 18 years or younger (originally 14). The punishment for a male between 18 and 21 years marrying a child became imprisonment of up to 15 days, a fine of 1,000 rupees, or both.\n\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India)\n\n\n*Now if goalposts are shifted and it is said Narendra was just a boy and it was his parents who got him married off, then*..\n\n> The punishment for a parent or guardian of a child taking place in the marriage became imprisonment of up to three months or a possible fine.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n> so the marriage would be null and void?\n\nFrom the same source:\n\n\n> .. an under-age marriage, where either the man or woman is over 16 years old, would not be a void marriage but voidable one, which would become valid if no steps are taken by such court as has option[s] to order otherwise. \n\n'

"> Suppression of depression is not good. Expression is always good. If depressed, share your feelings with others, it will make you feel better,\n\nExpression is often the toughest for the depressed... and it's not right to even insinuate that depression can be cured just by talking about. Most depressed people have nothing to talk about/share about because it's a silent killer - you don't really know why are you even depressed or what is even going on... and that is where counselling or drug interventions come in \n\nI didn't listen to the Mann ki baat - did he talk about the ways of tackling depression? Psychologist/Psychiatrist/Counselling interventions? Because if not, that's just cursory mention due to the whole 2017 - Year of depression thing. Although I do appreciate the attention it will get - I am just worried about the myths related to depression that are propagated like talking at home solves all problems, etc etc.. depression is lot of times a complex disease that can only be tackled with the help of right amount of therapy, medicines and other strategies which may or may not work but are rarely handy at home.. it needs professional intervention"
"Less talk more work, they're trying to push Babji Yoga on everyone mark my words he couldn't care less about depression.

But much like how Varanasi would become Kyoto, mental health is just a dog whistle to enrich babji's who are licking their lips. They're already pushing Hindutva in schools uner the guise of yoga to enrich private spiritual institutions. "

">What is greatness if we aren't happy!\n\nI moved to India from Europe, and I love living here. I love the food, the music, the kind nature of Indian people. However, looking at how the country is run, how people are treating their environment, and how people are doing their jobs; it’s not that great. And people don’t seem interested in improvement. Sure, they complain, but they don’t do anything about it.\n\nOne example:\n\nIn Europe, if you’re a house painter, you’ve gone to school for 8 years to learn the trade. You’re knowledgable and you’re proud of the work you do. If you make a mistake, you work on it until the result is perfect, and your employer does not bill the client for the extra work. The employer knows that’s the cost of doing business.\n\nHere in India, over the past few years I’ve had dozens of ‘professionals’ work on my house. Painters, carpenters, masons, etc. They have no clue what they’re doing, they make a mess, they don’t clean up, they only work when they know you’re looking, every mistake is someone else’s fault, they don’t measure anything, nothing is level, they don’t do any planning, they damage materials and tools. They show up late, take long lunches, and they leave early. No-one has any pride in their work, they don’t take any responsibility, they only care about getting paid.\n\nAnd this is not just my experience as a Western client, natives are getting the same lousy treatment: in many houses and businesses I visit, window sills and door frames and door handles are partially covered with paint, because the painter didn’t take the doors out of the hinges or remove the hardware before painting the doors. Light switches are attached to plywood panels that are screwed into the wall. Tiles are crudely cut and placed askew. Nothing is straight, nothing is finished. The standard answer is “It’s easily cleaned or filled with putty”. But of course they never do, it’s someone else’s responsibility.\n\nWhen you have no pride in your work, the activity you’re spending >8 hours a day on, 6 days a week, of course you’re vulnerable to depression."
"I think a lot of it is because of life quality.\n\n\nOur cities are crowded, too much traffic, not many parks. For some reason there isn't much fitness culture or outdoor adventure culture like western countries. Our office culture sucks, when did staying 12 hours in office become the standard? \n\n\nFor rural areas, economic stress and lack of opportunities may be the reason."
"I'm sorry but meditation, and everything else you mentioned work for stress and they are preventative at best. I mean for people who develop issues without a particular reason like loss of someone etc. Bipolar disorder can be hereditary, your default setting then is to be depressed and have episodes every now and then. "

'You might have a point, but don\'t knock on Yoga just yet. Yoga does seem to help people cope with depression. Some links:\n\n[Yoga for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23922209). Quote:\n\n> Despite methodological drawbacks of the included studies, yoga could be considered an ancillary treatment option for patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression.\n\n[Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20098228)\n\n> Although results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations. We would argue, however, that there are several reasons to consider constructing careful research on yoga for depression. First, current strategies for treating depression are not sufficient for many individuals, and patients have several concerns about existing treatments. Yoga may be an attractive alternative to or a good way to augment current depression treatment strategies. Second, aspects of yoga-including mindfulness promotion and exercise-are thought to be "active ingredients" of other successful treatments for depression. Third, there are plausible biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression. We provide suggestions for the next steps in the study of yoga as a treatment for depression.\n\n[Yoga for anxiety and depression](http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/yoga-for-anxiety-and-depression)\n\n> Many of the studies evaluating yoga\'s therapeutic benefits have been small and poorly designed. However, a 2004 analysis found that, in recent decades, an increasing number have been randomized controlled trials — the most rigorous standard for proving efficacy.\n\n> Available reviews of a wide range of yoga practices suggest they can reduce the impact of exaggerated stress responses and may be helpful for both anxiety and depression. In this respect, yoga functions like other self-soothing techniques, such as meditation, relaxation, exercise, or even socializing with friends.\n\nSome further reading:\n\n* "Yoga as medicine" by Dr. Timothy McCall for an enthusiastic review of the health benefits of Yoga. \n* The books by Loren Fishman who\'s an American doctor who prescribes Yoga for various conditions.\n* "The Science of Yoga" by William Broad for a highly skeptical but still positive review of Yoga.\n* While you\'re at it, also read up on mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn.\n\nThe books by BKS Iyengar, while it describes the practice of yoga from an Indian perspective, is not very much in alignment with science. Generally, I have found that Indian authors IMO tend to be unscientific in their portrayal of yoga, making absurd and unsubstantiated claims. The books by western medical professionals tend to be much more scientific and critical.'

'^From ^the ^article\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe economy under Modi\n\n### **India’s prime minister is not as much of a reformer as he seems**\n\n*But he is more of a nationalist firebrand*\n\nWHEN Narendra Modi became prime minister of India in 2014, opinion was divided as to whether he was a Hindu zealot disguised as an economic reformer, or the other way round. The past three years appear to have settled the matter. Yes, Mr Modi has pandered to religious sentiment at times, most notably by appointing a rabble-rousing Hindu prelate as chief minister of India’s most-populous state, Uttar Pradesh. But he has also presided over an acceleration in economic growth, from 6.4% in 2013 to a high of 7.9% in 2015—which made India the fastest-growing big economy in the world. He has pushed through reforms that had stalled for years, including an overhaul of bankruptcy law and the adoption of a nationwide sales tax (GST) to replace a confusing array of local and national levies. Foreign investment has soared, albeit from a low base. India, cabinet ministers insist, is at last becoming the tiger Mr Modi promised.\n\nAlas, these appearances are deceiving (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21723815-tax-reform-does-not-go-far-enough-land-and-labour-reforms-have-barely-been-tried-narendra-modi)). The GST, although welcome, is unnecessarily complicated and bureaucratic, greatly reducing its efficiency. The new bankruptcy law is a step in the right direction, but it will take much more to revive the financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks weighed down by dud loans. The central government’s response to a host of pressing economic problems, from the difficulty of buying land to the reform of rigid labour laws, has been to pass them to the states. And at least one of the big reforms it has undertaken—the overnight cancellation of most of India’s banknotes in an effort to curb the black economy—was counterproductive, hamstringing legitimate businesses without doing much harm to illicit ones. No wonder the economy is starting to drag. In the first three months of the year it grew at an annualised rate of 6.1%, more slowly than when Mr Modi came to power.\n\n**More an administrator than a reformer**\n\nIndia’s prime minister, in short, is not the radical reformer he is cracked up to be. He is more energetic than his predecessor, the stately Manmohan Singh, launching glitzy initiatives on everything from manufacturing to toilet-construction. But he has not come up with many big new ideas of his own (the GST and the bankruptcy reforms date back long before his time). His reputation as a friend to business rests on his vigorous efforts to help firms out of fixes—finding land for a particular factory, say, or expediting the construction of a power station. But he is not so good at working systematically to sort out the underlying problems holding the economy back.\n\nIndia does not just need power stations and parcels of land for development. It needs functioning markets for electricity and land—and capital and labour, for that matter. Lending to industry is contracting, for the first time in 20 years; Mr Modi should recapitalise state-owned banks and sell them off, to get loans flowing again. He should be working to simplify the over-exacting labour law, which perversely harms workers by deterring companies from hiring them formally. Property purchases are a forbidding quagmire; the government, at a minimum, should try to improve the quality of registers to reduce the scope for disputes.\n\nPolitical conditions are about as propitious for reform as they are ever likely to be. Mr Modi’s government is the strongest in decades. It has a big majority in the lower house of parliament and is edging closer to control of the upper house, as well. It runs most big states. The opposition is hopeless.\n\nThere are economic tailwinds, too. India is a big importer of oil; the low price of late has been boosting growth by perhaps two percentage points a year. Ageing has long weighed on Western economies and is starting to sap China’s. India, by contrast, is still young. Over a quarter of the people joining the world’s workforce between now and 2025 will be Indian. And there is enormous scope for catch-up growth: India is the poorest of the world’s 20 biggest economies. By rights, it should be surpassing others’ growth rates for years.\n\nMr Modi, in short, is squandering a golden opportunity. Some apologists claim that he is waiting until he wins a majority in the upper house before taking on bigger reforms. If so, he has given no inkling of what he is planning. In fact, he has not even made clear that economic reform is his priority.\n\n**More a chauvinist than an economist**\n\nAs prime minister, Mr Modi has been just as careful to court militant Hindus as jet-setting businessmen. His government recently created havoc in the booming beef-export business with onerous new rules on purchases of cattle, in deference to Hindus’ reverence for cows (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21723859-countrys-slaughterhouses-are-envy-rich-world-indias-huge-buffalo-meat-industry)). Yogi Adityanath, the man he selected to run Uttar Pradesh, is under investigation for inciting religious hatred and rioting, among other offences.\n\nThe fear is that, if the economy falters, Mr Modi will try to maintain his popularity by stirring up communal tensions. That, after all, is how his Bharatiya Janata Party first propelled itself to government in the 1990s. Mr Modi himself was chief minister of Gujarat in 2002 when rioting there killed at least 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. To this day, he has never categorically condemned the massacre or apologised for failing to prevent it.\n\nUnder Mr Modi, debate about public policy, and especially about communal relations, has atrophied (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21723888-narendra-modis-government-extremely-sensitive-criticism-indias-raucous-democracy-becoming)). Hindu nationalist thugs intimidate those who chide the government for straying from India’s secular tradition, or who advocate a less repressive approach to protests in Kashmir, India’s only state with a Muslim majority. One of the few media companies that dares to criticise the government has been raided by police on grounds that would not normally attract such heavy-handedness. Mr Modi himself has become the object of a sycophantic personality cult. The prime minister may intend all this as a way to keep winning elections. But it is not hard to imagine it going disastrously wrong.\n\nMr Modi’s admirers paint him as the man who at last unleashed India’s potential. In fact, he may go down in history for fluffing India’s best shot at rapid, sustained development. And the worries about a still darker outcome are growing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGuys, I am not a bot. :P'

'The simple reality is that India is a third world banana republic corrupt at every level of govt. You can\'t do a single darn stupid thing without being extorted to pay a bribe. The only thing India stands on is this heightened sense of patriotism that is brainwashed into our mindsets from this USSR era socialistic educational system.... even on reddit you have this banner of "united we stand". You know what, it\'s time to ditch this stupid sense of patriotism and remember it\'s every man for himself. Govt. has been using this stupid sense of patriotism as a means to achieve their own goals of power and authority. 300+ million people live below poverty line, 300+ million people do not have access to electricity. 90% of the economy is in unorganized labor and 95% is cash based and 85% of this cash is in 500 rs and 1000 rs notes and the govt with the stroke of the pen banned 85% of the money supply overnight in the name of making India a greater economy and people living in the big cities who are in the IT sector and the youngsters who use plastic and EFT for most transactions are fine with this brute force of govt. because it\'s part of the "digital economy" BS. And they expect everyone to stand in line for hours to get a messily 2000rs that won\'t be enough for even the basics. And the 1diot in chief expects old people and those in the labor class who are not well versed in modern technology to use "digital economy".... what a dictator. You can\'t even access and use your own money which you worked hard for and paid taxes for without being treated like a criminal. And people are fine with forcing everyone in this 95% cash economy to use this "digital economy" overnight so all these EFT payment processors and solutions can skim from each transaction.\n\nWell, if you think this is not fine, then time to get a passport, visa and find a greener pasture where you don\'t have to put up with this kind of BS. India is a third world $hit hole and will use and abuse your sense of patriotism for concentrating power in the hands of the powerful elite. Rules change every other day to accommodate their abuses while the rest of the country have to go through this crap. \n\nBest decision I made was to pay that last 100rs bribe demanded by the police officer to get my passport application cleared in 2003 and then later get a visa and escape for good from this third world crap through an IT company.  Good riddance. Atleast there are countless other opportunities to escape to a developed country where your labor is rewarded, you get the benefits of paying taxes and absolutely no one will dare extort a bribe from you because if they do, you can easily take them to court and have them pay hell for it.  "Shining India" my foot. "Economic super power"... what a joke.\n\nAnd I keep reading from patriots that this will eradicate black money, counterfeits that help terrorism  etc...are you kidding me? No one this country is still a third world $hithole because lemmings and useful 1diots put up with this crap and help the elite govt. officials by justifying it for them. '
'Just a thread where we Indians are criticising our government.\n\nThe right-wing, nationalist government which was elected in 2014 came to power with the promise of development.\n\nA month back, they decided to implement an ill thought out move to demonetise the higher currency notes to stop corruption and encourage digital transactions. \n\nSince India is a huge country with a largely illiterate population, this move has brought immense problems for most citizens. Specially since higher currency notes formed 86% of the total cash flow. '
'Our nation got fucked up big time and most of our citizens are brainwashed into thinking that the move to demonetise currency notes was a masterstroke by our PM to curb black money. '
'Please take most of the comments here using a bucket of salt.Majority of hate mongers are blind followers of erstwhile corrupt government lead by Con party which in turn lead by even more corrupt dynasty which ran country through a spineless/meek slave.'
'Just a weekly thread (almost turning into a daily routine lately) whining and moaning about how we\'re all doomed and that they\'re the only ones who seems to see it and everyone else is either brainwashed or a blind follower of Modi(the PM)/BJP(political party in power). I\'m starting to think that these people are part of some social media cell of the INC(the main opposition party). \n\n\nSo the PM made a decision to demonetize the high value notes without informing anyone(the 500 and the 1000 Rupee note), including his own party members(or so they claim, who the hell knows) with the stated intent to go after the black money, move the economy towards a digital economy(the phrase used was less-cash economy I believe), and fight the counterfeit notes currently in circulation.\n\n\nNow the black money is the money that people are hoarding and not paying taxes on, thus also not having the money circulate in the economy, which asking any economist will tell you is not good for said economy. Unlike most of the developed world, people do hoard money in this country. Especially the politicians who also double as thugs and gangs a lot of the time. We\'re not talking just couple thousand dollars worth but the amount tends to be in millions of dollars worth. Across the country, by far too many people. This move forced a lot of those people to now deposit said money in the bank while also disclosing where and how they got this money or risk having most of it turn useless. Now if it\'s found out that this money was gotten illegally or was not taxed, the Income Tax Department could take action on these people. There were also a few schemes introduced to let people declare their money before hand several months ago and steps were also taken to get more people into the banking system.\n\n\nAs for going digital is concerned, the rationale was that it\'ll be easier to keep track of people\'s money so that it can be taxed properly. Because right now only 2 to 3 percent of the population pay taxes. This move will hopefully increase the tax base. Whether it succeeds or not remains to be seen, as the full effects of this move will not be seen until Feb of next year, at least. Keeping track of people\'s money should also make it easier to combat the corruption and the bribery culture that is rampant in India. \n\n\nAs for the counterfeit money, a lot of our domestic terrorists tend to operate on fake currency and there were also reports that the ISI (the pakistani intelligence agency) was slowly flooding the Indian market with fake currency, and that they were also funding extremist groups around the country, almost exclusively with the large denomination notes. Now scrapping these large notes and replacing them with different ones was so that the funds to these groups would dry out quickly. And it takes a lot of times and money to get make good counterfeit currency again, unlike what many here seem to believe. This also plays into the going digital push, as it\'ll be easier to keep track of the money if the majority is done digitally. \n\n\nNow these were the stated goals and they were lofty goals. Whether they will be achieved or not remains to be seen. The bloody move still hasn\'t even been completed yet. The last day of the whole demonetization(or re-monetization as they\'re calling it now) exercise will end on Dec 31st I believe. The earliest we\'ll see the results of this whole things should be around Feb of next year. The long term impact will not be clear until even later. \n\n\nBut the majority on r/India has already decreed that this is stupidest move in history and that it has and will not have any benefits whatsoever. That this has destroyed the economy. And that the people are suffering and are in agony because they have to wait in lines. I have family living in the middle of nowhere in some no name village in India. I also have family who live in cities and even three relatives who work in banks. Now they all agree that yes people are not happy that they have to wait in ridiculously long lines, sometimes for nothing because the ATMs keep running out of cash. My grandparents and cousins who live in villages had to deal with trying to setup a proper bank account and trying to understand going digital through credit cards and phone payments. It hasn\'t been that easy on them or the people they know. My banker relatives were completely overworked the past few weeks. \n\n\nBut the one sentiment that they all shared was that atleast this government was doing something. Anything. To combat the corruption that has plagued this country for decades under the INC(Indian National Congress) rule. The INC made corruption the backbone and bribery the culture of this country for the half century that they ruled this nation. Their last PM was known for maintaining a "dignified" silence as his party was found to be complicit in one scam after another. What amazes me is that everything that the people on this sub accuse the BJP and Modi of doing is something the INC is far more guilty of. India has seen far more communal divide and riots and decisions and measures that are closer to fascist regimes under the INC rule than we have seen under the BJP rule. Everyone here seems to conveniently forget how the INC looted this country for decades. And just how many hundreds of millions were truly suffering and dying under their rule. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Not a fan or the supporter of BJP. I believe that the top leadership of BJP is filled with either corrupt or incompetent idiots. I believed it when they were in the opposition and they\'ve done little to change that perception. But they\'re about a thousand times better than all the opposition parties combined right now. '
"Our government lead by the ultra nationalist Bharat Janta Party implemented a Machiavellian policy to loot money from the people and at the same time liquidate money for banks. They demonitised ₹500 and ₹1000 notes giving us till 31 th December to get new notes. Anybody who doesn't return cash money until then loses money. Then the government is having difficulties printing put the new cash so chaos. Then they are being partial by releasing newly printed cash in constituencies that vote for their party. \n\n\n\nThis tldr, our nationalist government fucked us over."
'A lot of demonetization haters are misguiding you in believing that it is a bad move. The other side of the story is that there are many supporters of demonetization and probably they are in plenty. /r/india is a bunch of frustrated individuals who love to bitch about the problems in the country. If it was really a bad move, there would have been riots and protests across the country. However, the public has been co-operating with the govt to maximum extent. I as an honest tax payer support the move because it brings in a lot of individuals and businesses under the perview of income tax (which they evaded in past by always dealing with cash).\n\nHope this helps you with other side of the story.'

These years post Independence to 2000 were dominated by successive Congress governments.  \n  \nSo when "what has Congress done" is asked, I usually interpret it to mean "Congress has horribly failed India\'s poor, repeatedly over decades". I don\'t think it means "what has Congress done for India\'s urban elite".  \n   \nWho cares about a bunch of airports and stadia when a few hundred million are malnourished and unemployed? It seems bizarre to me that people defend the Congress, but then I know very little about the nitty gritty of this politics. I think 5 years back most Congress supporters would have been laughed out of the room. I want that to be the status quo.  \n  \nI want the BJP to have a credible alternative and in my eyes the Congress sucks major ass, and is nowhere near the credible alternative India deserves.'

So I'll just say this, this is you country and let no asshole make you feel otherwise.\n\nBut be on guard, troubling times these."
'I can only imagine the psychological condition in which you must be. When as a whole Muslim community is being treated as an enemy. '
'Many of us will always stand with fellow citizens, when their right to a peaceful life is threatened by the actions of nasty people calling themselves nationalists. But come election time, i fear the sane voices you hear on randia will most likely be overwhelmed by the "silent majority"/sanghi IT army. When that happens, please remember many of us will still stand by you, even if we are swamped out of the forum. '
'We should condemn terrorism, mob violence, disturbance, rape,  bullying, murder, dacoity, violence against women, animal abuse, etc, regardless of what caste, religion, tribe, group, or country they belong to. If tomorrow some KKK or some Muslim groups do something around these parameters, we must not shy away from our duty to condemn them. Otherwise, we become no better than the gau rakshaks that we criticize for being hypocrites.\n\nCondemn, is a strong word that indulges a person to constitute an act as wrong and disapprove of it. When Modi condemns an attack on [Manchester, England](http://www.firstpost.com/world/narendra-modi-condemns-manchester-terror-attack-in-uk-says-he-is-pained-by-assault-3470526.html) but not the dozens that keep happening on his own homeland, you have to wonder what his agendas are? Where his true lineage lies, what he will sacrifice, what he has sacrificed, and what he wants in the long run. Because come bhakts understand this that no matter what you do, pushing 180 million ((18 crore)) muslims out of this country at the cost of a bloodbath is not feasible. So, either learn to live with it like you have been, or keep fighting till they fight back and let history be a palindrome. \n\nYes OP, times are dark, we are to blame, but keep your head held high, and though they shall have our bodies but not our souls. '
'Why the fuck is this post 38% downvoted? There are people in this sub who support these lynching?'
"These violent acts are condemnable indeed. But look at the full picture too. These cases of lynchings are mostly reactions to cattle smugglers breaking the law and stealing cattle from villages, and some of these media reports add the beef/cow angle even if there wasn't any (like the recent Junaid case). The more I read about it, the more it seems like an issue of incompetent enforcement of the law - police not doing their job, so people take the law into their own hands. Question what the media is trying to portray.  "
'seriously, there are people who support those lynchings in quora, twitter, etc.,??? \n\ni mean... not wanting to kill cows is one thing, but killing people for that?? '
"Isn't it nice when sane people come out and defend what's right OP?... This is exactly what the progressive Muslims need to start doing too. Speak out against atrocities committed by other Muslims. I'm yet to come across Muslims who condemn Islamic terrorism with the same frevor that they condemn Israel with. This is the reason why moderate Muslims have no voice in the world. You twiddle thumbs when the extremists are issuing insane fatwas, but take up issues personally when a Hindu extremists makes a retarded  remark."
"I sympathise with you and mourn for the lost secular, inclusive India. \nDescribing some dark stuff below - pls stop reading if you can't handle worst case scenarios.\n\nThings will get much worse before they become better. Your comparison to Jews during Nazi Germany though hyperbolic, is possible. Though it is not that bad right now, things will become worse going forward. \n\nThe reason why seemingly educated people become communal is simple - they mistakenly feel that they have to define what Hinduism is. \nFor the common man, there are some other reasons. Outlet for their anger and frustrations - they did not get a good job, jealousy of a more successful neighbour or relative. \nWanting to belong to a larger movement. Even mundane reasons like trying to impress neighbours or family.\n\nThe sensible people will reject bigotry but most of them will be too scared to speak out, others will wait for it to blow away and only a very very small percentage of them will do anything about it. These people who will try to do something positive will be bullied as sickular traitors - even if they are Benares Brahmins. \n\nWhenever there is a failure in governance, cow issue will be ignited. Ignite enough fires and it will become an inferno.\nVictims will not just be Muslims but even Christians, Dalits and any upper caste Hindu who dare speak against it.\nWe will start seeing some mass conversions to Hinduism.\n\nUnless a lot more secular minded people get together to make a lot of noise, the future looks bleak.\n"
"As a Hindu, I am sorry for the loss of lives of the people killed by illiterate stupid goons on the reasoning of stupid beliefs. These thugs are in no way religiously associated but just are filled with hatred(the quantity of these kind of people are miniscule). But they are slowly spreading hatred against Muslims especially for no reason through WhatsApp forwards.. When they are argued upon they are even clueless about the reasoning of such conclusion.\n\nTL;DR: There are a large number of illiterates, illogical people who are speaking language of BJP and they don't even understand what they are saying..These half assed nationalists are stilla  threat."
'I am totally against any sort of crime, and attacking someone in the name of cow is punishable.  Though this is my stance, I hate most of the cow related posts here.\n\nThe reason is because the cow related stories and discussions happening here so far has failed to tell the ground reality at the crime scene which is usually told in any crime stories.  What did police do?  Was the mob arrested or not?  If not, is the police supporting the mob?  Why is this not reported to higher police officials?\n\nThese are some of the basic questions answered in any crime incidents but I don\'t see them in the stories about cow related violence.  I just see plain emotions and name calling.  Something like "Mudiji must answer" kind of responses.  I feel like this should stop to get more support from mainstream masses.\n\n '
'dude even people who do not eat beef are pretty pissed off about these new laws....you can not shove such rules down peoples throats......\n\nand more importantly there are bigger issues India should be focusing on...like people crapping in the open, lack of water, lack of water, corruption, pollution '
"It is just incidental actually. \n\nRandia supports anything that's against current practices. \n\nA muslim should not be celebrating this nor thanking. \n\nTomorrow of government starts helping Muslims more, randia will cry appeasement and blah blah. \n\nThe situation is bothersome because there is resentment in the majority which is being egged on by the ruling factions. I fear things are going to get worse, if the issues of the majority is not properly addressed.\n\nFrankly, just calling them out without providing solutions, anti-hindu speeches, insults and what not is only going to escalate the situation and other minorities (religious or otherwise) are going to suffer more tomorrow. \n\nIf not addressed properly, this is going to turn out much worse. "
"You are mostly wrong.\n\nPeople here are angry on Modi, so they attack everyone who is pro-Modi. In 2019 if Modi loses, then you will see people becoming pro Modi, pro BJP.\n\nIf you really think anyone gives a fuck about Muslim, you are wrong. The majority don't care and won't care."
'Islam is a militant faith. So stfu with your taqqiya dude. Your people never apologise for terror attacks carried out in name of Islam. Think about that first. Dont you dare talk about Jews. I know how much anti-semitic an average Muslim is. I havent met a single practicing Muslims who doesnt do apologia for terrorists but you will find many Hindus including me saying that we should be more tolerant towards Muslim. Stop with your perennial victimhood peddling which you guys do all over the world. '

"This I dont understand. Why should Indian muslims who don't  give a shit about  Kashmir be held to account for what they do? I cant help thinking its just another piss poor excuse  because Muslim haters really have no valid reasons  to hate Indian Muslims. They are not traitors. They have members in the army. Call out western Muslims  and I'd get where  you're coming from. But I dont see Indian muslims calling for sharia law. So Hindutva assholes have to time travel or bring up all kinds of unrealated bs to justify their hate.\n\nTldr: Indian muslims are very different from Kashmiri muslims. Do your research before spouting bs ffs."
'> Tomorrow of government starts helping Muslims more, randia will cry appeasement and blah blah. \n\nI don\'t think this is necessarily in conflict with criticising the govt for tacitly approving gau rakshas. For instance I don\'t agree with exempting Muslims (and other minority insts) from RTE, or the fact that we still have TT and no UCC, or with Rajiv Gandhi\'s actions in the Shah Bano case, or with the banning of Satanic Verses, or with banning homosexuality just because all religions hate it. That doesn\'t mean I\'m on board with killing people for beef or even banning beef - quite the contrary. And the reasons for both stands are exactly the same; the govt shouldn\'t be appeasing Hindus by banning beef or Muslims by allowing separate laws.\n\nThe BJP on one hand and the INC (and other "secular" parties) on the other have made a complete pig\'s breakfast of secularism in this country to the point that it seems impossible to have a *principled* stand on the issue, which is unfortunate.

'Do you really believe that gaurakshasas are getting bad publicity here by being associated with modi? What are you smoking?'
'Not entirely true. Yes, majority of us hates Modi, not just because he is a PM or some Right wing and NRIs dream come true. But for what he is and was. Millennials who were kids back then in 2002 would never understand his. Imagine a murderer got away from justice because he didn\'t have enough evidences. Inspite of all the witnesses were there enough to pin him down but were slowly and carefully wiped out,killed and murdered. He did not allow RTI and free press in his own state of Gujarat , he made murders look like accidents, something which shivraj Chatham of MP is following his footsteps in Vyapam killings.\n\nThat person with lots of PR and image make over has been made shiny clean. That\'s like giving Dawood a clean chit had he been in India. Yes it can be compared because both were Kingpins in their own methods. Doesn\'t make them fit for democracy at all.\n\nHindu extremists and handful of businessmen are profiting from him and doing whatever the fuck they like without fearing the law and threatening the Supreme Court time and again. Jaitely the evil scum bag is making sure of that.\n\nIf Congress would have been in power, no way BJP would have supported, GST, FDI 100% or even Demonetization. Because those are not in favor of Indian populous which are poor and lower middle classes. \n\nI refuse to support Rich fucks alone because they are not the ones who run this country alone. And 75% of the are Bank defaulters and getting 4 lakh cores of debt waived off just like that. 6% of Interest rates for their BMWs and Mercedes etc. Hence they are already in cloud 9 no matter what happens to the country. The first peoples will be the rich to fly away from the country if this country goes to doom.\n\nAnyways,  to avoid answers like every time shit happens, he goes to another country to pretend he is doing something by shaking hands and hugging. That\'s the PM of India right now. And his followers are using the same line like Congress that " why should PM respond to every small matters.He is so busy." Yeah right.  \n\nI remember in 2004 people were already getting tired of inflation and prize rise in just 3 years due to war of 1999, and on top of that Communal murders were still going on as BJP was under power and vajpayee became helpless due to his health and knee situation. Same Jaitely took charge and twisted the economy into worse. A simple Onion got them out of power.\n\nThis will happen again as BJP are continuing where they stopped back in 2004 era. And people are yet again realizing it. They should have never bought the Acche Din bullshit which was a camouflage. Dogs tail and all that.\n\nMajorities can change and it will. Back then even we thought vajpayee is the real deal. He was the real hands clean kind of guy minus the 1992 shit. That was all Advani which he is now paying for it because the new BJP guards have thrown him under the bus, specially by the man who had his back. Vajpayee had almost decided to kick Modi\'s butt for good, only Advani saved him. And now look hows that working for him. That\'s Modi for you. A person who is no loyal to his own gang cannot be loyal to anything that he says or commits.'

The generation that suffered through it put that behind them in the interest of the nation and deference to the Constitution, also because we had politicians who could rise above petty electioneering.\n\nPlease do not justify this in the name of something that happened 7-decades ago. \n\nWhat we are seeing now has been engineered by the people in power now, they cut open the wounds and let it fester so they can use that to stay in power. This is the biggest tragedy of our times, if we don't stand up to it, history will judge us harshly. \n\n"
'**Religious violence in India**\n\nCommunal violence in India includes acts of violence by followers of one religious group against followers and institutions of another religious group, often in the form of rioting. Religious violence in India, especially in recent times, has generally involved Hindus and Muslims, although incidents of violence have also involved atheists, Christians and Sikhs. There is also history of Muslim – Parsee riots (List of riots in Mumbai).\n\nDespite the secular and religiously tolerant constitution of India, broad religious representation in various aspects of society including the government, the active role played by autonomous bodies such as National Human Rights Commission of India and National Commission for Minorities, and the ground-level work being out by Non-governmental organisations, sporadic and sometimes serious acts of religious violence tend to occur as the root causes of religious violence often run deep in history, religious activities, and politics of India.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24'

'What I have seen is that this government is adamant on implying taxes on the middle class and the lower class but as far as source of income is concerned they always give vague explanations as to why they\'re not at par with the cost of living. First the pension of defense personnel were cut back; then, more than a years delay in implying 7th pay commission; cost of pulses, vegetables and daily goods have not been checked. Moreover the demonetization of the banknotes did nothing. The rich were hardly affected and the burden was borne by the lower and middle class people. Lynching of people in the name of national integrity cannot be accepted. They put ban on the internal consumption of beef products only to benefit from it\'s export. There are so many things that we need to see, research and gauge out ourselves but that cannot happen while we blindly accept what the government asks us to do. Why are we paying taxes on transacting from our own account? Granted that using ATMs other than our own banks should incur charges but it\'s simply extortion by the government that I have to pay them even when I\'m taking out MY OWN MONEY. An economy as big as ours cannot survive solely on "cashless" transactions when we are still struggling with basic necessities such as employment, farmer loans, lack of infrastructure in the rural areas and most importantly the failing illusion of secularism and the idea of free speech.'

If he makes mistakes, well all politicians can be shown the mirror.\n\nWhat has happened in the past 3 years is that the sheer amount of mob mentality in us Indians has come to the front.

"What's the solution though? It's a conundrum. It's the protestors' right under FOE to protest on Social Media, and the businesses' right to sate them to avoid bad publicity. It's also the comedian's right under FOE to mock the Prime Minister. Similar issues are happening in the US with vehemently pro-Trump or anti-Trump businesses too."
"Different issue though. Social Media campaigns against brands due to their political stance can't just be shown the door, as they have a tendency to magnify and spread falsehoods. This can lead to a significant loss of revenue and traction. This is not just theoretical, but the business faces tangible losses which they can't just ignore. So, they end up being very cautious and politically risk-averse. Taking a stance publicly is just not worth it for the brand or senior management."

Hell, how many even consider our policies in J&K before voting? How many vote thinking that the government will reclaim PoK? Very very few. Modi\'s attacks on Congress were mainly because he claimed them to be weak on terrorism.

'Personal anecdote here:\n\nRecently on a train journey I was sitting next to a young Muslim man with a beard who was reading some religious text in Arabic on his mobile (presumably the Quoran). Internally I was going like "I don\'t want to sit next to such a guy. Why does he have to read this in a public place."\n\nThen I realized had I been sitting next to someone with a shaven head reading the Bhagavad  Gita, my disgust would not be as intense. \n\nNow I consider myself liberal, atheist and all that, and hold no love for any religion. But I would still feel more comfortable sitting next to a Pandit than to a Maulvi. \n\nI realized then that it is just prejudice in my heart and nothing to do with the guy\'s actions. If we don\'t like a person or a community, we should look inside us whether it is our prejudice or discomfort that is the reason for our dislike, or the other person\'s actions. 9/10 the reason will lie within oneself.'

"There are other issues with the renewable apart form the paying capacity. Solar and Wind are close to grid parity so in near future the paying capacity will not be an issue, assuming the paying capacity exists at the levels of coal based power. \n\nThe other issues are the health of the discoms and the infrastructure. Populist policies have rendered many state Discoms bankrupt. On infrastructure the key problem is the state of the Grid. Evacuation problems in case of wind & solar, the inability f the grid to handle the volatility of the renewable sources and the inability of the northern and southern grids to seamlessly inter-exchange are other issues. For example, TN's power demand is equivalent of about 15GW. The state has 9GW of wind capacity though. In peak months, when wind PLF could touch 50%+, TN could have had about 50% demand met through wind, but the grid doesn't support that. "

Let's saw 0.1% of the spectrum was sold, Rai just multiplied it by 1000 to get his number.\n\nHe did not factor in the fact that the reason that sliver demanded such a high price was because the resource was scarce and spectrum was hard to buy. If someone offered to sell me water in the middle of the sahara I would pay more per liter than if someone sold it to me in meghalaya.\n\nSimilarly, when all spectrum was auctioned in bulk the second time, prices were much lower, and much closer to the prices in the first auction.\n\nAlthough all the numbers associated with the scam 'loss to exchequer' etc are essentially imaginary, (I can go deeper into this if people are interested) the scam is real.

'In what universe was killing an 80 year old Gandhi necessary?'
"Supremacist thinking is fairly normalized in India sadly. Either along caste lines, or region, or religion. Gandhi and Nehru were idealists, and always thought that an educated elite would be able to lead the country forward under a secular constitution. Sadly this gradually just fell apart and the old elite politicians became deeply corrupt. What replaced them were populist thugs, who are much like modern-day feudal lords. So the real face of India was let loose.\n\nThings will probably get worse until the average Indian learns to be a part of the civilized modern world and actually understands how secular humanist ideals are better for everyone.\n\nTo add to this, India never really faced the shock of WW2 so the dangers of majoritarian violence and fascism aren't there. The far-right in western countries, even under Trump is still fringe. In India it's mainstream. Similarly the cold war legacy never really impacted India, so fear of authoritarianism or appreciation of human rights never really developed.\n\nThe BJP and the Sangh are really just a symptom, not necessarily the cause. Perhaps they did open the jar where all the communal hatred was bottled up. Of course the congress has never done enough to curb right wing extremism, and at times encouraged it (Ayodhya). But the BJP takes this to another level."
"I don't know how old you are or where you have lived in India, but during throughout the 90s, minority appeasement was THE norm by congress at all levels (especially the state levels). Hell, does noone remember the raise in OBC quota in iim/aiims in 2004 and the riots and protests that followed? The majority voice which was usually frowned upon as too right wing/pro hindutva by the media took over the political narrative in the late 2000s as the UPA started crumbling and the Modi train kept chugging ahead. It came to a tipping point during the 2014 elections when the incredible propaganda wing of BJP/RSS used social media to their benefit and spread the feeling of 'Hindu pride' or 'persecution complex'.\n\nHistorically speaking, no one used to give a shit about the majority in the 80s because the votes were guaranteed for INC. It was the norm. They had so many cult like figures that it was only the swing voters of minority that needed to be canvassed for. It was the masjid incident that started it all to realise even the majority needs to be included in policy making decisions, resulting in the 2014 elections and the mainstreaming of right wing. "

'> To this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.\n\n> “His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”\n\n> “Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.\n\n> “I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”\n\n[Zakia’s conspiracy angle ‘crumbled’ with Supreme Court verdict on Sanjiv Bhatt: Gujarat High Court](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/zakias-conspiracy-angle-crumbled-with-supreme-court-verdict-on-sanjiv-bhatt-gujarat-high-court-4878357/)\n\n> The Gujarat High Court order on the petition of late Congress MP Ahsan Jafri’s widow Zakia Jafri has said that one of the main pillars of allegations of a larger conspiracy in the 2002 post-Godhra riots has “crumbled” following the Supreme Court’s decision on former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt. “Much water has flown, as discussed at length, and one of the main pillars of the Protest Petition of Sanjiv Bhatt’s evidence has crumbled in wake of the decision of the apex court,” Justice Sonia Gokani wrote in the order pronounced on Thursday. The order was made available on Friday.\nAhsan Jafri was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre in Ahmedabad during the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Bhatt had claimed in the affidavit, filed nine years after the riots, that he was present in a meeting on February 27, 2002, at then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi’s residence. In its 2015 order, the SC had dismissed Bhatt’s petition seeking an independent probe into the FIR lodged at Ghatlodia police station, Ahmedabad, by police constable K D Panth.\n\n> Panth had alleged that he was forced to sign on an affidavit prepared by Bhatt to prove that the latter was present in the meeting at Modi’s residence. Justice Gokani observed that the apex court order revealed “how the unholy nexus of certain officers with certain other planners led to the apex court dismissing the petition of forming SIT for investigating into the crime registered at Ghatlodia police station.”\n\n> The court said, “His (Bhatt’s) handshakes with various agencies to influence the SIT and course of justice in the case of Ms Jafri also exponentially revealed the extent to which everything was planned. Various observations made by the amicus curiae in relation to presence of Bhatt in the meeting held by the then Chief Minister on 27.02.2002 have been quoted, in fact, in extenso in the order impugned….”'

Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti is not acceptable: PM Modi
86% killed in cow-related violence since 2010 are Muslim, 97% attacks after Modi govt came to power
Case registered against actor Prakash Raj over his criticism of PM Modi
Arrested man made PM Modi remark on private Facebook chat

As a Muslim, I want to thank /r/india for condemning cow-based terrorism.

'My watchman is crying and freaking out as he just got paid with 500s and 1000s. Told him to calm down and that I would personally get his money exchanged. '
"Fucking hell, I'm not a Modi supporter, but the balls on this guy, wew lad!"
'Fuck me. Have around 50K at home in 500s and 1000s thanks to my ATM allergic parents. I have to go and get it changed soon. Also, fuck me again for paying 1600 as cash at a shop just 30 minutes back. All in 100s.\n\nOther than that, good move. Should have a heavy impact on low/mid level black money hoarders.'
'Major push!!!!!!! Modi does which everyone thought was impossible, people with money under their bed, you can now burn them, they are now worthless crap!'
"Oh boy converting your black money to white is gonna get costly. From 18-20% it'll increase to 30-40%. People are gonna regret not opting for income declaration scheme. "

'So I have 5000 INR as an NRI. Do I just lose it?'
"Summary of what Modi ji is saying\n\n- All Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes will be obsolete from today midnight. No one will accept them from tomorrow\n\n- Exception to the above are essential medicines and hospital payments for next 72 hours. A doctor's note will allow you to use Rs 500\n\n- People traveling can use the notes to book tickets and at petrol pumps, crematarioum, burial grounds, etc\n\n- People arriving from other countries can get notes changed at the airport for up to Rs 5k\n\n- You will have from 9th Nov to 30th Dec to deposit the money into your bank with no limits. This means if you have cash lying around you can deposit all into your account and there is no limit for that\n\n- After 30th Dec, you can still exchange the notes with RBI till March 31st, 2018\n\n- Keeping in mind that the new cash will be limited, the amount a person can withdraw is Rs 10k at one time, and upto Rs 20k a week\n\n- For immediate needs, you can go to any bank or post office, show your ID and and change notes for up to Rs 4k\n\n\n- For the next few days, only Rs 2k can be withdrawn at the ATM. This will increase to 4k in few weeks\n\n- Bank and ATMs closed for 9th Nov. \n\n- This will not impact any electronic transactions, EFT, online, debit cards, credit cards etc which will continue as before"
'Half the people on news network today praising the development are worried sick about their own stash back home'
'On a negative side, the wedding season starts in two days. People who had withdrawn money in brand new notes of 500 and 1000 are proper fucked right now. Lots of cash required in Indian weddings, even if you are lower middle class.'
'My Point of View as a banker regarding this massive change in public transactions with so many new laws regarding cash.\n\na. Our all existing cash counting/fake detector machines at all banks will be rendered obsolete [the process of exchanging /dealing with it will be around some billions for sure and writing off the same will cause more redness in already loss making banks].\n\nb. ATMs will have to adjust with new dispensers of Rs 2000/- currency and new software/ATM service systems in a short span. The same have to be limited with new, shortened withdrawal limit.\n\nc. All branches will have to deal with massive line with massive cash to deposit whereas cash retention limit of all branches are quite low.\n\nd. The banks will have to ask details of the huge obsolete cash tenders from its already known customers who deal in black, which will cause further brand damage and fear of losing customers.\n\ne. Cashiers who have accustomed to check the current tenders will now have to relearn the new tricks/designs in new tenders.\n\nf. RBI yet to discuss/disseminate any concrete plan how it will dispense such massive cash outflow from its existing mints [which now has to implement new plates/machines for new series].\n\nPublic may suffer for short time but I think its it the banks in the economy who will have to pay a long bill in form of manpower/ asset/service/customer retention. Let us see how this craziness & chaos will fold out in upcoming days.'

The cow shit is a metaphor for the failure of Swachh Bharat. The shit in front of the ATM for Demonetization. I'm *overexplaining* things here, but the cow refers to the beef ban.\n\n\n\nYes.

"A minister of Modi's cabinet went to pay his respects to one of the killers of Akhlaq (Dadri), father of an Indian Air Force employee. The body of the killer was draped in the national flag.

This is replication of 'Gujarat model' at the national level.\n\nWhat's tragic is that this protracted violence is extremely effective. Whatever neutral media outfits are left can report the same modus operandi, similar news only so much times before it becomes repetitive and loses it's effectiveness. People can show outrage only so much times before they too become callous and morally desensitized, one can't blame them either. All the lies, fake news and misinformation being spread requires exponentially more effort to counter than it takes to formulate and spread them. No wonder people will one day get exhausted of countering it too. That is exactly how the new insidious fascism works."
'The data collection method is extremely biased and cannot reflect reality. There may be more of these attacks *or* less of these attacks but any analysis based on this data is completely wrong.

Where information was incomplete, we spoke to the journalists who filed the original reports.\nMuslim victims were identified by name. In 8% of the 63 cases, the reports explicitly stated that those attacked were Dalits, who are also targets because many among them clear cow carcasses, skin them and eat beef. In a few cases, religion was difficult to determine.\nIn 50.8% (32) of the cases, the targets were Muslim, in 7.9% (5) Dalit, 4.8% (3) Sikh or Hindu (names appeared Sikh, but it wasn’t certain) and 1.6% (one) Christian; in 20.6% (13) cases, religion was not reported. Among 14.3% (9) cases, the targets were Hindus, but their caste was not clear.\nPolice officers and onlookers were injured in 8% (5) of the attacks; 27% of those targeted were women.\nNote: This study was built around searches in English-language media and may omit cow-related violence reported only in Hindi and other language media.

US had 1094 [bias related](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election) crime incidents just after election, and that figure includes anti-Trump attacks too. Mind it, US has much lesser population than India and also stronger law enforcement. \n\n63 people had been [killed](http://time.com/4368615/orlando-mass-shootings-chart/) and 75 wounded in mass shootings in US in 2016 alone. Since 2010, 250 people have died. That's nearly 10 times people killed by cow vigilantes in India, and mass shootings in US is a hot topic for news. \n\nLet's go to peaceful Europe, shall we? \n\nRace and religious inspired hate crime rose by [41% in UK](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37640982). The numbers were over 5000. If you are looking at logic, that's a big jump. Sure, some people can argue Europe can have higher police reporting, but more than 20x reporting as in India, especially when even a brawl in train is given a beef angle by media? I highly doubt. \n\nLet's come to our home. \n\nBy fatalities, 158 people have died because of insurgency in [J&K alone](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/Cumulative_Fatalities.htm) this year. Maoist attacks killed 205. Please free to calculate the fatalities of all years from 2010 and let me know where Hindutwa terrorism stands.\n\nStats by itself have no meaning. They always need to be compared with something else to know the ground reality. \n\nSo should violence by cow vigilantes be condemned? A huge big **YES**. Are they over hyped? Now you decide. "

The only incident reported in the northeast was the murder of two men in Assam on 30 April, 2017.\n>>About half the cases of cow-related violence – 32 of 63 – were from states governed by the BJP at the time; 8 were run by the Congress, and the rest by other parties, including the Samajwadi Party (Uttar Pradesh), People’s Democratic Party (Jammu & Kashmir) and Aam Aadmi Party (Delhi).\n>>“Lynching does not find mention in the Indian Penal Code. No particular law has been passed to deal with lynching,” India Today noted on June 25, 2017. “Absence of a codified law to deal with mob violence or lynching makes it difficult to deliver justice in the cases of riots. However, Section 223(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 says that persons or a mob involved in the same offence in the same act can be tried together. But, this has not proved to have given enough legal teeth to (the) justice delivery system.”\n>>In a fifth of the cases, police registered cases against victims/survivors\n>>Of the 63 attacks over eight years, 61 (96.8%) occurred, as we said, after Modi’s government came to power (2014-2017), with 2016 reporting the most attacks: 25. In the first six months of 2017, 20 attacks were reported–more than 75% of the 2016 figure.\n>>In 5% of the attacks, there was no report of attackers being arrested. In 13 attacks (21%), the police registered cases against the victims/survivors.\n'
"The sanghis would have riots if they wanted to flair the communal tensions but that sort of thing can backfire against you with the sort of international backlash and attention it generates.\n\nLynchings are the perfect plan because if you kill one muslim per day, the number would never be high to generate outrage in the pro govt media channels. People and newspapers would mostly ignore or not play it as a much bigger issue.\n\nWith daily lynchings, there would come a time when this would be a daily occurrence, people would become apathetic and no one would care to ask questions. The govt would still continue to label every non bjp state as a mini pakistan and continue flair the resentment against mainorities.\n\nMake no mistake. Today it is muslims. Tomorrow they will come for sikhs by weaving an imaginary khalistani story and arnab and rahul shivashankar to sell it for them. When they'd be done with them then they will turn to christians and buddhists and dalits.\nAnd that will be the time, when the talibanization of this country would be complete when there will be no more imaginary liberals to bash and cows to milk, when the opposition would realise that only hindutva sells and they would reorganize their own strategies and rewrite their own manifestoes. That will be the time, Indians would be sorry that they never spoke out when there was still time."

Its goal was to eliminate the dangers placed on young girls who could not handle the stress of married life and avoid early deaths. This Act defined a male child as 21 years (originally 18) or younger, a female child as 18 years (originally 14) or younger, and a minor as a child of either sex 18 years or younger (originally 14). The punishment for a male between 18 and 21 years marrying a child became imprisonment of up to 15 days, a fine of 1,000 rupees, or both.\n\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India)\n\n\n*Now if goalposts are shifted and it is said Narendra was just a boy and it was his parents who got him married off, then*..\n\n> The punishment for a parent or guardian of a child taking place in the marriage became imprisonment of up to three months or a possible fine.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n> so the marriage would be null and void?\n\nFrom the same source:\n\n\n> .. an under-age marriage, where either the man or woman is over 16 years old, would not be a void marriage but voidable one, which would become valid if no steps are taken by such court as has option[s] to order otherwise. \n\n'

Which is unchanged from the previous WHO report, making the TOI article from 2 years a go just as wrong as they are now.\n\nI understand why TOI doesn’t link to actual reports, because clearly they don’t read/understand those. (The other explanation is malice, but I’ll assume inaptitude.)\n\nAll that is not to say that India doesn’t have a depression problem: WHO has repeatedly stated that depression is highest in India. There’s no need for Indian newspapers to make up numbers, the real numbers are sad enough. '
"Yes, depression is a big issue in our country, often most Indians don't even know what that is.\n\nLet's talk about it, thank you for reminding us PM."
'Is this the first for an Indian PM? \n\nOn a side note, I briefly saw a girl who was battling depression, it was a huge learning experience for me, the sheer pressure of society drives them further into their mental cages. '
"Yes, I've been suffering from it for almost three years now."
'Good that PM is talking about depression.\n\nPeople in our country pass off depression as a temporary thing or just assume it as their personality. '
"Anyone who has come out of depression what's the way?"
"Expand all comments here and you'll know /r/india needs a discussion on depression the most."
'Great to see this issue being talked about by the PM! for me this is sign of development right here mental health needs to be addressed most people simply dont acknowledge things like depression however I personally think the WHO reports are a bit BS I mean i really dont think that 36% of our population is suffering from depression I can bet the number is not that high unless you count self-diagnosed cases'

The whole point of depression counselling is to not have subjective attachment to the depressed and openly listen to their problems. But he manages to talk about joint families which really many times are the first to hush up and/or cause and perpetrate depression. \n\nYea good job highlighting it at any rate."
"> Suppression of depression is not good. Expression is always good. If depressed, share your feelings with others, it will make you feel better,\n\nExpression is often the toughest for the depressed... and it's not right to even insinuate that depression can be cured just by talking about. Most depressed people have nothing to talk about/share about because it's a silent killer - you don't really know why are you even depressed or what is even going on... and that is where counselling or drug interventions come in \n\nI didn't listen to the Mann ki baat - did he talk about the ways of tackling depression? Psychologist/Psychiatrist/Counselling interventions? Because if not, that's just cursory mention due to the whole 2017 - Year of depression thing. Although I do appreciate the attention it will get - I am just worried about the myths related to depression that are propagated like talking at home solves all problems, etc etc.. depression is lot of times a complex disease that can only be tackled with the help of right amount of therapy, medicines and other strategies which may or may not work but are rarely handy at home.. it needs professional intervention"
"Less talk more work, they're trying to push Babji Yoga on everyone mark my words he couldn't care less about depression. They'll tell everyone to join some stupid spiritual course nonsense to solve their depression. If he really cared we'll see it through a huge increase in mental health spending through public healthcare services. But much like how Varanasi would become Kyoto, mental health is just a dog whistle to enrich babji's who are licking their lips. They're already pushing Hindutva in schools uner the guise of yoga to enrich private spiritual institutions. "

">What is greatness if we aren't happy!\n\nI moved to India from Europe, and I love living here. I love the food, the music, the kind nature of Indian people. However, looking at how the country is run, how people are treating their environment, and how people are doing their jobs; it’s not that great. And people don’t seem interested in improvement. Sure, they complain, but they don’t do anything about it.\n\nOne example:\n\nIn Europe, if you’re a house painter, you’ve gone to school for 8 years to learn the trade. You’re knowledgable and you’re proud of the work you do. If you make a mistake, you work on it until the result is perfect, and your employer does not bill the client for the extra work. The employer knows that’s the cost of doing business.\n\nHere in India, over the past few years I’ve had dozens of ‘professionals’ work on my house. Painters, carpenters, masons, etc. They have no clue what they’re doing, they make a mess, they don’t clean up, they only work when they know you’re looking, every mistake is someone else’s fault, they don’t measure anything, nothing is level, they don’t do any planning, they damage materials and tools. They show up late, take long lunches, and they leave early. No-one has any pride in their work, they don’t take any responsibility, they only care about getting paid.\n\nAnd this is not just my experience as a Western client, natives are getting the same lousy treatment: in many houses and businesses I visit, window sills and door frames and door handles are partially covered with paint, because the painter didn’t take the doors out of the hinges or remove the hardware before painting the doors. Light switches are attached to plywood panels that are screwed into the wall. Tiles are crudely cut and placed askew. Nothing is straight, nothing is finished. The standard answer is “It’s easily cleaned or filled with putty”. But of course they never do, it’s someone else’s responsibility.\n\nWhen you have no pride in your work, the activity you’re spending >8 hours a day on, 6 days a week, of course you’re vulnerable to depression."
"I think a lot of it is because of life quality.\n\n\nOur cities are crowded, too much traffic, not many parks. For some reason there isn't much fitness culture or outdoor adventure culture like western countries. Our office culture sucks, when did staying 12 hours in office become the standard? \n\n\nFor rural areas, economic stress and lack of opportunities may be the reason."
"I'm sorry but meditation, and everything else you mentioned work for stress and they are preventative at best. I mean for people who develop issues without a particular reason like loss of someone etc. Bipolar disorder can be hereditary, your default setting then is to be depressed and have episodes every now and then. "

'Amazing how you can spin awareness on depression as a negative. Wah!'
'You might have a point, but don\'t knock on Yoga just yet. Yoga does seem to help people cope with depression. Some links:\n\n[Yoga for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23922209). Quote:\n\n> Despite methodological drawbacks of the included studies, yoga could be considered an ancillary treatment option for patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression.\n\n[Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20098228)\n\n> Although results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations. We would argue, however, that there are several reasons to consider constructing careful research on yoga for depression. First, current strategies for treating depression are not sufficient for many individuals, and patients have several concerns about existing treatments. Yoga may be an attractive alternative to or a good way to augment current depression treatment strategies. Second, aspects of yoga-including mindfulness promotion and exercise-are thought to be "active ingredients" of other successful treatments for depression. Third, there are plausible biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression. We provide suggestions for the next steps in the study of yoga as a treatment for depression.\n\n[Yoga for anxiety and depression](http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/yoga-for-anxiety-and-depression)\n\n> Many of the studies evaluating yoga\'s therapeutic benefits have been small and poorly designed. However, a 2004 analysis found that, in recent decades, an increasing number have been randomized controlled trials — the most rigorous standard for proving efficacy.\n\n> Available reviews of a wide range of yoga practices suggest they can reduce the impact of exaggerated stress responses and may be helpful for both anxiety and depression. In this respect, yoga functions like other self-soothing techniques, such as meditation, relaxation, exercise, or even socializing with friends.\n\nSome further reading:\n\n* "Yoga as medicine" by Dr. Timothy McCall for an enthusiastic review of the health benefits of Yoga. \n* The books by Loren Fishman who\'s an American doctor who prescribes Yoga for various conditions.\n* "The Science of Yoga" by William Broad for a highly skeptical but still positive review of Yoga.\n* While you\'re at it, also read up on mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn.\n\nThe books by BKS Iyengar, while it describes the practice of yoga from an Indian perspective, is not very much in alignment with science. Generally, I have found that Indian authors IMO tend to be unscientific in their portrayal of yoga, making absurd and unsubstantiated claims. The books by western medical professionals tend to be much more scientific and critical.'

'^From ^the ^article\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe economy under Modi\n\n### **India’s prime minister is not as much of a reformer as he seems**\n\n*But he is more of a nationalist firebrand*\n\nWHEN Narendra Modi became prime minister of India in 2014, opinion was divided as to whether he was a Hindu zealot disguised as an economic reformer, or the other way round. The past three years appear to have settled the matter. Yes, Mr Modi has pandered to religious sentiment at times, most notably by appointing a rabble-rousing Hindu prelate as chief minister of India’s most-populous state, Uttar Pradesh. But he has also presided over an acceleration in economic growth, from 6.4% in 2013 to a high of 7.9% in 2015—which made India the fastest-growing big economy in the world. He has pushed through reforms that had stalled for years, including an overhaul of bankruptcy law and the adoption of a nationwide sales tax (GST) to replace a confusing array of local and national levies. Foreign investment has soared, albeit from a low base. India, cabinet ministers insist, is at last becoming the tiger Mr Modi promised.\n\nAlas, these appearances are deceiving (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21723815-tax-reform-does-not-go-far-enough-land-and-labour-reforms-have-barely-been-tried-narendra-modi)). The GST, although welcome, is unnecessarily complicated and bureaucratic, greatly reducing its efficiency. The new bankruptcy law is a step in the right direction, but it will take much more to revive the financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks weighed down by dud loans. The central government’s response to a host of pressing economic problems, from the difficulty of buying land to the reform of rigid labour laws, has been to pass them to the states. And at least one of the big reforms it has undertaken—the overnight cancellation of most of India’s banknotes in an effort to curb the black economy—was counterproductive, hamstringing legitimate businesses without doing much harm to illicit ones. No wonder the economy is starting to drag. In the first three months of the year it grew at an annualised rate of 6.1%, more slowly than when Mr Modi came to power.\n\n**More an administrator than a reformer**\n\nIndia’s prime minister, in short, is not the radical reformer he is cracked up to be. He is more energetic than his predecessor, the stately Manmohan Singh, launching glitzy initiatives on everything from manufacturing to toilet-construction. But he has not come up with many big new ideas of his own (the GST and the bankruptcy reforms date back long before his time). His reputation as a friend to business rests on his vigorous efforts to help firms out of fixes—finding land for a particular factory, say, or expediting the construction of a power station. But he is not so good at working systematically to sort out the underlying problems holding the economy back.\n\nIndia does not just need power stations and parcels of land for development. It needs functioning markets for electricity and land—and capital and labour, for that matter. Lending to industry is contracting, for the first time in 20 years; Mr Modi should recapitalise state-owned banks and sell them off, to get loans flowing again. He should be working to simplify the over-exacting labour law, which perversely harms workers by deterring companies from hiring them formally. Property purchases are a forbidding quagmire; the government, at a minimum, should try to improve the quality of registers to reduce the scope for disputes.\n\nPolitical conditions are about as propitious for reform as they are ever likely to be. Mr Modi’s government is the strongest in decades. It has a big majority in the lower house of parliament and is edging closer to control of the upper house, as well. It runs most big states. The opposition is hopeless.\n\nThere are economic tailwinds, too. India is a big importer of oil; the low price of late has been boosting growth by perhaps two percentage points a year. Ageing has long weighed on Western economies and is starting to sap China’s. India, by contrast, is still young. Over a quarter of the people joining the world’s workforce between now and 2025 will be Indian. And there is enormous scope for catch-up growth: India is the poorest of the world’s 20 biggest economies. By rights, it should be surpassing others’ growth rates for years.\n\nMr Modi, in short, is squandering a golden opportunity. Some apologists claim that he is waiting until he wins a majority in the upper house before taking on bigger reforms. If so, he has given no inkling of what he is planning. In fact, he has not even made clear that economic reform is his priority.\n\n**More a chauvinist than an economist**\n\nAs prime minister, Mr Modi has been just as careful to court militant Hindus as jet-setting businessmen. His government recently created havoc in the booming beef-export business with onerous new rules on purchases of cattle, in deference to Hindus’ reverence for cows (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21723859-countrys-slaughterhouses-are-envy-rich-world-indias-huge-buffalo-meat-industry)). Yogi Adityanath, the man he selected to run Uttar Pradesh, is under investigation for inciting religious hatred and rioting, among other offences.\n\nThe fear is that, if the economy falters, Mr Modi will try to maintain his popularity by stirring up communal tensions. That, after all, is how his Bharatiya Janata Party first propelled itself to government in the 1990s. Mr Modi himself was chief minister of Gujarat in 2002 when rioting there killed at least 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. To this day, he has never categorically condemned the massacre or apologised for failing to prevent it.\n\nUnder Mr Modi, debate about public policy, and especially about communal relations, has atrophied (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21723888-narendra-modis-government-extremely-sensitive-criticism-indias-raucous-democracy-becoming)). Hindu nationalist thugs intimidate those who chide the government for straying from India’s secular tradition, or who advocate a less repressive approach to protests in Kashmir, India’s only state with a Muslim majority. One of the few media companies that dares to criticise the government has been raided by police on grounds that would not normally attract such heavy-handedness. Mr Modi himself has become the object of a sycophantic personality cult. The prime minister may intend all this as a way to keep winning elections. But it is not hard to imagine it going disastrously wrong.\n\nMr Modi’s admirers paint him as the man who at last unleashed India’s potential. In fact, he may go down in history for fluffing India’s best shot at rapid, sustained development. And the worries about a still darker outcome are growing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGuys, I am not a bot. :P'

'The simple reality is that India is a third world banana republic corrupt at every level of govt. You can\'t do a single darn stupid thing without being extorted to pay a bribe. The only thing India stands on is this heightened sense of patriotism that is brainwashed into our mindsets from this USSR era socialistic educational system.... even on reddit you have this banner of "united we stand". You know what, it\'s time to ditch this stupid sense of patriotism and remember it\'s every man for himself. Govt. has been using this stupid sense of patriotism as a means to achieve their own goals of power and authority. 300+ million people live below poverty line, 300+ million people do not have access to electricity. 90% of the economy is in unorganized labor and 95% is cash based and 85% of this cash is in 500 rs and 1000 rs notes and the govt with the stroke of the pen banned 85% of the money supply overnight in the name of making India a greater economy and people living in the big cities who are in the IT sector and the youngsters who use plastic and EFT for most transactions are fine with this brute force of govt. because it\'s part of the "digital economy" BS. And they expect everyone to stand in line for hours to get a messily 2000rs that won\'t be enough for even the basics. And the 1diot in chief expects old people and those in the labor class who are not well versed in modern technology to use "digital economy".... what a dictator. You can\'t even access and use your own money which you worked hard for and paid taxes for without being treated like a criminal. And people are fine with forcing everyone in this 95% cash economy to use this "digital economy" overnight so all these EFT payment processors and solutions can skim from each transaction.\n\nWell, if you think this is not fine, then time to get a passport, visa and find a greener pasture where you don\'t have to put up with this kind of BS. India is a third world $hit hole and will use and abuse your sense of patriotism for concentrating power in the hands of the powerful elite. Rules change every other day to accommodate their abuses while the rest of the country have to go through this crap. \n\nBest decision I made was to pay that last 100rs bribe demanded by the police officer to get my passport application cleared in 2003 and then later get a visa and escape for good from this third world crap through an IT company.  Good riddance. Atleast there are countless other opportunities to escape to a developed country where your labor is rewarded, you get the benefits of paying taxes and absolutely no one will dare extort a bribe from you because if they do, you can easily take them to court and have them pay hell for it.  "Shining India" my foot. "Economic super power"... what a joke.\n\nAnd I keep reading from patriots that this will eradicate black money, counterfeits that help terrorism  etc...are you kidding me? No one this country is still a third world $hithole because lemmings and useful 1diots put up with this crap and help the elite govt. officials by justifying it for them. '
'Just a thread where we Indians are criticising our government.\n\nThe right-wing, nationalist government which was elected in 2014 came to power with the promise of development.\n\nA month back, they decided to implement an ill thought out move to demonetise the higher currency notes to stop corruption and encourage digital transactions. \n\nSince India is a huge country with a largely illiterate population, this move has brought immense problems for most citizens. Specially since higher currency notes formed 86% of the total cash flow. '
'Our nation got fucked up big time and most of our citizens are brainwashed into thinking that the move to demonetise currency notes was a masterstroke by our PM to curb black money. '
'Please take most of the comments here using a bucket of salt.Majority of hate mongers are blind followers of erstwhile corrupt government lead by Con party which in turn lead by even more corrupt dynasty which ran country through a spineless/meek slave.'
'Just a weekly thread (almost turning into a daily routine lately) whining and moaning about how we\'re all doomed and that they\'re the only ones who seems to see it and everyone else is either brainwashed or a blind follower of Modi(the PM)/BJP(political party in power). I\'m starting to think that these people are part of some social media cell of the INC(the main opposition party). \n\n\nSo the PM made a decision to demonetize the high value notes without informing anyone(the 500 and the 1000 Rupee note), including his own party members(or so they claim, who the hell knows) with the stated intent to go after the black money, move the economy towards a digital economy(the phrase used was less-cash economy I believe), and fight the counterfeit notes currently in circulation.\n\n\nNow the black money is the money that people are hoarding and not paying taxes on, thus also not having the money circulate in the economy, which asking any economist will tell you is not good for said economy. Unlike most of the developed world, people do hoard money in this country. Especially the politicians who also double as thugs and gangs a lot of the time. We\'re not talking just couple thousand dollars worth but the amount tends to be in millions of dollars worth. Across the country, by far too many people. This move forced a lot of those people to now deposit said money in the bank while also disclosing where and how they got this money or risk having most of it turn useless. Now if it\'s found out that this money was gotten illegally or was not taxed, the Income Tax Department could take action on these people. There were also a few schemes introduced to let people declare their money before hand several months ago and steps were also taken to get more people into the banking system.\n\n\nAs for going digital is concerned, the rationale was that it\'ll be easier to keep track of people\'s money so that it can be taxed properly. Because right now only 2 to 3 percent of the population pay taxes. This move will hopefully increase the tax base. Whether it succeeds or not remains to be seen, as the full effects of this move will not be seen until Feb of next year, at least. Keeping track of people\'s money should also make it easier to combat the corruption and the bribery culture that is rampant in India. \n\n\nAs for the counterfeit money, a lot of our domestic terrorists tend to operate on fake currency and there were also reports that the ISI (the pakistani intelligence agency) was slowly flooding the Indian market with fake currency, and that they were also funding extremist groups around the country, almost exclusively with the large denomination notes. Now scrapping these large notes and replacing them with different ones was so that the funds to these groups would dry out quickly. And it takes a lot of times and money to get make good counterfeit currency again, unlike what many here seem to believe. This also plays into the going digital push, as it\'ll be easier to keep track of the money if the majority is done digitally. \n\n\nNow these were the stated goals and they were lofty goals. Whether they will be achieved or not remains to be seen. The bloody move still hasn\'t even been completed yet. The last day of the whole demonetization(or re-monetization as they\'re calling it now) exercise will end on Dec 31st I believe. The earliest we\'ll see the results of this whole things should be around Feb of next year. The long term impact will not be clear until even later. \n\n\nBut the majority on r/India has already decreed that this is stupidest move in history and that it has and will not have any benefits whatsoever. That this has destroyed the economy. And that the people are suffering and are in agony because they have to wait in lines. I have family living in the middle of nowhere in some no name village in India. I also have family who live in cities and even three relatives who work in banks. Now they all agree that yes people are not happy that they have to wait in ridiculously long lines, sometimes for nothing because the ATMs keep running out of cash. My grandparents and cousins who live in villages had to deal with trying to setup a proper bank account and trying to understand going digital through credit cards and phone payments. It hasn\'t been that easy on them or the people they know. My banker relatives were completely overworked the past few weeks. \n\n\nBut the one sentiment that they all shared was that atleast this government was doing something. Anything. To combat the corruption that has plagued this country for decades under the INC(Indian National Congress) rule. The INC made corruption the backbone and bribery the culture of this country for the half century that they ruled this nation. Their last PM was known for maintaining a "dignified" silence as his party was found to be complicit in one scam after another. What amazes me is that everything that the people on this sub accuse the BJP and Modi of doing is something the INC is far more guilty of. India has seen far more communal divide and riots and decisions and measures that are closer to fascist regimes under the INC rule than we have seen under the BJP rule. Everyone here seems to conveniently forget how the INC looted this country for decades. And just how many hundreds of millions were truly suffering and dying under their rule. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Not a fan or the supporter of BJP. I believe that the top leadership of BJP is filled with either corrupt or incompetent idiots. I believed it when they were in the opposition and they\'ve done little to change that perception. But they\'re about a thousand times better than all the opposition parties combined right now. '
"Our government lead by the ultra nationalist Bharat Janta Party implemented a Machiavellian policy to loot money from the people and at the same time liquidate money for banks. They demonitised ₹500 and ₹1000 notes giving us till 31 th December to get new notes. Anybody who doesn't return cash money until then loses money. Then the government is having difficulties printing put the new cash so chaos. Then they are being partial by releasing newly printed cash in constituencies that vote for their party. \n\n\n\nThis tldr, our nationalist government fucked us over."

The other side of the story is that there are many supporters of demonetization and probably they are in plenty. /r/india is a bunch of frustrated individuals who love to bitch about the problems in the country. If it was really a bad move, there would have been riots and protests across the country. However, the public has been co-operating with the govt to maximum extent. I as an honest tax payer support the move because it brings in a lot of individuals and businesses under the perview of income tax (which they evaded in past by always dealing with cash).\n\nHope this helps you with other side of the story.'

I don\'t think it means "what has Congress done for India\'s urban elite".  \n   \nWho cares about a bunch of airports and stadia when a few hundred million are malnourished and unemployed? It seems bizarre to me that people defend the Congress, but then I know very little about the nitty gritty of this politics. I think 5 years back most Congress supporters would have been laughed out of the room. I want that to be the status quo.  \n  \nI want the BJP to have a credible alternative and in my eyes the Congress sucks major ass, and is nowhere near the credible alternative India deserves.'

'We should condemn terrorism, mob violence, disturbance, rape,  bullying, murder, dacoity, violence against women, animal abuse, etc, regardless of what caste, religion, tribe, group, or country they belong to.

Otherwise, we become no better than the gau rakshaks that we criticize for being hypocrites.\n\nCondemn, is a strong word that indulges a person to constitute an act as wrong and disapprove of it.

Where his true lineage lies, what he will sacrifice, what he has sacrificed, and what he wants in the long run. Because come bhakts understand this that no matter what you do, pushing 180 million ((18 crore)) muslims out of this country at the cost of a bloodbath is not feasible. So, either learn to live with it like you have been, or keep fighting till they fight back and let history be a palindrome. \n\nYes OP, times are dark, we are to blame, but keep your head held high, and though they shall have our bodies but not our souls.

'Why the fuck is this post 38% downvoted? There are people in this sub who support these lynching?'
"These violent acts are condemnable indeed. But look at the full picture too. These cases of lynchings are mostly reactions to cattle smugglers breaking the law and stealing cattle from villages, and some of these media reports add the beef/cow angle even if there wasn't any (like the recent Junaid case). The more I read about it, the more it seems like an issue of incompetent enforcement of the law - police not doing their job, so people take the law into their own hands. Question what the media is trying to portray.  "
'seriously, there are people who support those lynchings in quora, twitter, etc.,??? \n\ni mean... not wanting to kill cows is one thing, but killing people for that?? '
"Isn't it nice when sane people come out and defend what's right OP?... This is exactly what the progressive Muslims need to start doing too. Speak out against atrocities committed by other Muslims. I'm yet to come across Muslims who condemn Islamic terrorism with the same frevor that they condemn Israel with. This is the reason why moderate Muslims have no voice in the world. You twiddle thumbs when the extremists are issuing insane fatwas, but take up issues personally when a Hindu extremists makes a retarded  remark."
"I sympathise with you and mourn for the lost secular, inclusive India. \nDescribing some dark stuff below - pls stop reading if you can't handle worst case scenarios.\n\nThings will get much worse before they become better. Your comparison to Jews during Nazi Germany though hyperbolic, is possible. Though it is not that bad right now, things will become worse going forward. \n\nThe reason why seemingly educated people become communal is simple - they mistakenly feel that they have to define what Hinduism is. \nFor the common man, there are some other reasons. Outlet for their anger and frustrations - they did not get a good job, jealousy of a more successful neighbour or relative. \nWanting to belong to a larger movement. Even mundane reasons like trying to impress neighbours or family.\n\nThe sensible people will reject bigotry but most of them will be too scared to speak out, others will wait for it to blow away and only a very very small percentage of them will do anything about it. These people who will try to do something positive will be bullied as sickular traitors - even if they are Benares Brahmins. \n\nWhenever there is a failure in governance, cow issue will be ignited. Ignite enough fires and it will become an inferno.\nVictims will not just be Muslims but even Christians, Dalits and any upper caste Hindu who dare speak against it.\nWe will start seeing some mass conversions to Hinduism.\n\nUnless a lot more secular minded people get together to make a lot of noise, the future looks bleak.\n"
"As a Hindu, I am sorry for the loss of lives of the people killed by illiterate stupid goons on the reasoning of stupid beliefs. These thugs are in no way religiously associated but just are filled with hatred(the quantity of these kind of people are miniscule). But they are slowly spreading hatred against Muslims especially for no reason through WhatsApp forwards.. When they are argued upon they are even clueless about the reasoning of such conclusion.\n\nTL;DR: There are a large number of illiterates, illogical people who are speaking language of BJP and they don't even understand what they are saying..These half assed nationalists are stilla  threat."
'I am totally against any sort of crime, and attacking someone in the name of cow is punishable.  Though this is my stance, I hate most of the cow related posts here.\n\nThe reason is because the cow related stories and discussions happening here so far has failed to tell the ground reality at the crime scene which is usually told in any crime stories.  What did police do?  Was the mob arrested or not?  If not, is the police supporting the mob?  Why is this not reported to higher police officials?\n\nThese are some of the basic questions answered in any crime incidents but I don\'t see them in the stories about cow related violence.  I just see plain emotions and name calling.  Something like "Mudiji must answer" kind of responses.  I feel like this should stop to get more support from mainstream masses.\n\n '

"It is just incidental actually. \n\nRandia supports anything that's against current practices. \n\nA muslim should not be celebrating this nor thanking. \n\nTomorrow of government starts helping Muslims more, randia will cry appeasement and blah blah. \n\nThe situation is bothersome because there is resentment in the majority which is being egged on by the ruling factions. I fear things are going to get worse, if the issues of the majority is not properly addressed.\n\nFrankly, just calling them out without providing solutions, anti-hindu speeches, insults and what not is only going to escalate the situation and other minorities (religious or otherwise) are going to suffer more tomorrow. \n\nIf not addressed properly, this is going to turn out much worse.

"This I dont understand. Why should Indian muslims who don't  give a shit about  Kashmir be held to account for what they do? I cant help thinking its just another piss poor excuse  because Muslim haters really have no valid reasons  to hate Indian Muslims. They are not traitors. They have members in the army. Call out western Muslims  and I'd get where  you're coming from. But I dont see Indian muslims calling for sharia law. So Hindutva assholes have to time travel or bring up all kinds of unrealated bs to justify their hate.\n\nTldr: Indian muslims are very different from Kashmiri muslims. Do your research before spouting bs ffs."
'> Tomorrow of government starts helping Muslims more, randia will cry appeasement and blah blah. \n\nI don\'t think this is necessarily in conflict with criticising the govt for tacitly approving gau rakshas. For instance I don\'t agree with exempting Muslims (and other minority insts) from RTE, or the fact that we still have TT and no UCC, or with Rajiv Gandhi\'s actions in the Shah Bano case, or with the banning of Satanic Verses, or with banning homosexuality just because all religions hate it. That doesn\'t mean I\'m on board with killing people for beef or even banning beef - quite the contrary. And the reasons for both stands are exactly the same; the govt shouldn\'t be appeasing Hindus by banning beef or Muslims by allowing separate laws.\n\nThe BJP on one hand and the INC (and other "secular" parties) on the other have made a complete pig\'s breakfast of secularism in this country to the point that it seems impossible to have a *principled* stand on the issue, which is unfortunate.

'Do you really believe that gaurakshasas are getting bad publicity here by being associated with modi? What are you smoking?'
'Not entirely true. Yes, majority of us hates Modi, not just because he is a PM or some Right wing and NRIs dream come true. But for what he is and was. Millennials who were kids back then in 2002 would never understand his. Imagine a murderer got away from justice because he didn\'t have enough evidences. Inspite of all the witnesses were there enough to pin him down but were slowly and carefully wiped out,killed and murdered. He did not allow RTI and free press in his own state of Gujarat , he made murders look like accidents, something which shivraj Chatham of MP is following his footsteps in Vyapam killings.\n\nThat person with lots of PR and image make over has been made shiny clean. That\'s like giving Dawood a clean chit had he been in India. Yes it can be compared because both were Kingpins in their own methods. Doesn\'t make them fit for democracy at all.\n\nHindu extremists and handful of businessmen are profiting from him and doing whatever the fuck they like without fearing the law and threatening the Supreme Court time and again. Jaitely the evil scum bag is making sure of that.\n\nIf Congress would have been in power, no way BJP would have supported, GST, FDI 100% or even Demonetization. Because those are not in favor of Indian populous which are poor and lower middle classes. \n\nI refuse to support Rich fucks alone because they are not the ones who run this country alone. And 75% of the are Bank defaulters and getting 4 lakh cores of debt waived off just like that. 6% of Interest rates for their BMWs and Mercedes etc. Hence they are already in cloud 9 no matter what happens to the country. The first peoples will be the rich to fly away from the country if this country goes to doom.\n\nAnyways,  to avoid answers like every time shit happens, he goes to another country to pretend he is doing something by shaking hands and hugging. That\'s the PM of India right now. And his followers are using the same line like Congress that " why should PM respond to every small matters.He is so busy." Yeah right.  \n\nI remember in 2004 people were already getting tired of inflation and prize rise in just 3 years due to war of 1999, and on top of that Communal murders were still going on as BJP was under power and vajpayee became helpless due to his health and knee situation. Same Jaitely took charge and twisted the economy into worse. A simple Onion got them out of power.\n\nThis will happen again as BJP are continuing where they stopped back in 2004 era. And people are yet again realizing it. They should have never bought the Acche Din bullshit which was a camouflage. Dogs tail and all that.\n\nMajorities can change and it will. Back then even we thought vajpayee is the real deal. He was the real hands clean kind of guy minus the 1992 shit. That was all Advani which he is now paying for it because the new BJP guards have thrown him under the bus, specially by the man who had his back. Vajpayee had almost decided to kick Modi\'s butt for good, only Advani saved him. And now look hows that working for him. That\'s Modi for you. A person who is no loyal to his own gang cannot be loyal to anything that he says or commits.'

'**Religious violence in India**\n\nCommunal violence in India includes acts of violence by followers of one religious group against followers and institutions of another religious group, often in the form of rioting. Religious violence in India, especially in recent times, has generally involved Hindus and Muslims, although incidents of violence have also involved atheists, Christians and Sikhs. There is also history of Muslim – Parsee riots (List of riots in Mumbai).\n\nDespite the secular and religiously tolerant constitution of India, broad religious representation in various aspects of society including the government, the active role played by autonomous bodies such as National Human Rights Commission of India and National Commission for Minorities, and the ground-level work being out by Non-governmental organisations, sporadic and sometimes serious acts of religious violence tend to occur as the root causes of religious violence often run deep in history, religious activities, and politics of India.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24'

'What I have seen is that this government is adamant on implying taxes on the middle class and the lower class but as far as source of income is concerned they always give vague explanations as to why they\'re not at par with the cost of living. First the pension of defense personnel were cut back; then, more than a years delay in implying 7th pay commission; cost of pulses, vegetables and daily goods have not been checked. Moreover the demonetization of the banknotes did nothing. The rich were hardly affected and the burden was borne by the lower and middle class people. Lynching of people in the name of national integrity cannot be accepted. They put ban on the internal consumption of beef products only to benefit from it\'s export. There are so many things that we need to see, research and gauge out ourselves but that cannot happen while we blindly accept what the government asks us to do. Why are we paying taxes on transacting from our own account? Granted that using ATMs other than our own banks should incur charges but it\'s simply extortion by the government that I have to pay them even when I\'m taking out MY OWN MONEY. An economy as big as ours cannot survive solely on "cashless" transactions when we are still struggling with basic necessities such as employment, farmer loans, lack of infrastructure in the rural areas and most importantly the failing illusion of secularism and the idea of free speech.'

If he makes mistakes, well all politicians can be shown the mirror.\n\nWhat has happened in the past 3 years is that the sheer amount of mob mentality in us Indians has come to the front.

Yea we follow different Gods, but at the end of the day, we were all immigrants trying to earn our daily bread in a foreign country. \n\nThis is why I feel social media has made us feel that we are different. Folks should get out and talk to other people instead of reading comments and tweets and labelling them. Our governments have disappointed us all equally and we label our neighbours based on the acts of their governments. You can be a Modi bhakt or Kejriwal bhakt or a commie, its fine. This us vs them attitude is seriously driving a wedge between our own people. I've said this before and I'll say this again if the British introduced Divide and rule, we've let our politicians carry that on. all these caste and religion politics is exactly that. The dumb folks have the microphone on the social media and we get a feel that's how the other group is. No, it isn't! Get out and talk to people. \n\nHappy holidays folks!"

Hell, how many even consider our policies in J&K before voting? How many vote thinking that the government will reclaim PoK? Very very few. Modi\'s attacks on Congress were mainly because he claimed them to be weak on terrorism.

'Personal anecdote here:\n\nRecently on a train journey I was sitting next to a young Muslim man with a beard who was reading some religious text in Arabic on his mobile (presumably the Quoran). Internally I was going like "I don\'t want to sit next to such a guy. Why does he have to read this in a public place."\n\nThen I realized had I been sitting next to someone with a shaven head reading the Bhagavad  Gita, my disgust would not be as intense. \n\nNow I consider myself liberal, atheist and all that, and hold no love for any religion. But I would still feel more comfortable sitting next to a Pandit than to a Maulvi. \n\nI realized then that it is just prejudice in my heart and nothing to do with the guy\'s actions. If we don\'t like a person or a community, we should look inside us whether it is our prejudice or discomfort that is the reason for our dislike, or the other person\'s actions. 9/10 the reason will lie within oneself.'

"There are other issues with the renewable apart form the paying capacity. Solar and Wind are close to grid parity so in near future the paying capacity will not be an issue, assuming the paying capacity exists at the levels of coal based power. \n\nThe other issues are the health of the discoms and the infrastructure. Populist policies have rendered many state Discoms bankrupt. On infrastructure the key problem is the state of the Grid. Evacuation problems in case of wind & solar, the inability f the grid to handle the volatility of the renewable sources and the inability of the northern and southern grids to seamlessly inter-exchange are other issues. For example, TN's power demand is equivalent of about 15GW. The state has 9GW of wind capacity though. In peak months, when wind PLF could touch 50%+, TN could have had about 50% demand met through wind, but the grid doesn't support that. "

He became President of South Africa and an Idol for his Honesty and Humiliation. He took Gandhi\'s name, read his countless books,  but he actually followed him like no other human being, one could even imagine. Yet he never put garland on Gandhi\'s statue for photo ops. He garlanded himself with Gandhi\'s ideologies.Only those people deserve to take Gandhi\'s name like they actually mean it.\n\nI hate when anybody use Gandhi for camouflage.

"Basically Vinod Rai's estimates were based on a small sliver of spectrum which was resold by one party to another. Let's saw 0.1% of the spectrum was sold, Rai just multiplied it by 1000 to get his number.\n\nHe did not factor in the fact that the reason that sliver demanded such a high price was because the resource was scarce and spectrum was hard to buy. If someone offered to sell me water in the middle of the sahara I would pay more per liter than if someone sold it to me in meghalaya.\n\nSimilarly, when all spectrum was auctioned in bulk the second time, prices were much lower, and much closer to the prices in the first auction.\n\nAlthough all the numbers associated with the scam 'loss to exchequer' etc are essentially imaginary, (I can go deeper into this if people are interested) the scam is real. There was a lot of arbitrary favouritism being done to disqualify certain parties so that certain business groups would be guaranteed spectrum. At around the same time A Raja was meddling in the auction process to get competitors disqualified based on technicalities - A Raja got richer by 3000 crore, and this was believed to be due to bribes... although I can't find a good detailed explanation of how this whole thing worked."

'In what universe was killing an 80 year old Gandhi necessary?'
"Supremacist thinking is fairly normalized in India sadly. Either along caste lines, or region, or religion. Gandhi and Nehru were idealists, and always thought that an educated elite would be able to lead the country forward under a secular constitution. Sadly this gradually just fell apart and the old elite politicians became deeply corrupt. What replaced them were populist thugs, who are much like modern-day feudal lords. So the real face of India was let loose.\n\nThings will probably get worse until the average Indian learns to be a part of the civilized modern world and actually understands how secular humanist ideals are better for everyone.\n\nTo add to this, India never really faced the shock of WW2 so the dangers of majoritarian violence and fascism aren't there. The far-right in western countries, even under Trump is still fringe. In India it's mainstream. Similarly the cold war legacy never really impacted India, so fear of authoritarianism or appreciation of human rights never really developed.\n\nThe BJP and the Sangh are really just a symptom, not necessarily the cause. Perhaps they did open the jar where all the communal hatred was bottled up. Of course the congress has never done enough to curb right wing extremism, and at times encouraged it (Ayodhya). But the BJP takes this to another level."
"I don't know how old you are or where you have lived in India, but during throughout the 90s, minority appeasement was THE norm by congress at all levels (especially the state levels). Hell, does noone remember the raise in OBC quota in iim/aiims in 2004 and the riots and protests that followed? The majority voice which was usually frowned upon as too right wing/pro hindutva by the media took over the political narrative in the late 2000s as the UPA started crumbling and the Modi train kept chugging ahead. It came to a tipping point during the 2014 elections when the incredible propaganda wing of BJP/RSS used social media to their benefit and spread the feeling of 'Hindu pride' or 'persecution complex'.\n\nHistorically speaking, no one used to give a shit about the majority in the 80s because the votes were guaranteed for INC. It was the norm. They had so many cult like figures that it was only the swing voters of minority that needed to be canvassed for. It was the masjid incident that started it all to realise even the majority needs to be included in policy making decisions, resulting in the 2014 elections and the mainstreaming of right wing. "

'> To this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.\n\n> “His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”\n\n> “Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.\n\n> “I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”\n\n[Zakia’s conspiracy angle ‘crumbled’ with Supreme Court verdict on Sanjiv Bhatt: Gujarat High Court](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/zakias-conspiracy-angle-crumbled-with-supreme-court-verdict-on-sanjiv-bhatt-gujarat-high-court-4878357/)\n\n> The Gujarat High Court order on the petition of late Congress MP Ahsan Jafri’s widow Zakia Jafri has said that one of the main pillars of allegations of a larger conspiracy in the 2002 post-Godhra riots has “crumbled” following the Supreme Court’s decision on former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt. “Much water has flown, as discussed at length, and one of the main pillars of the Protest Petition of Sanjiv Bhatt’s evidence has crumbled in wake of the decision of the apex court,” Justice Sonia Gokani wrote in the order pronounced on Thursday. The order was made available on Friday.\nAhsan Jafri was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre in Ahmedabad during the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Bhatt had claimed in the affidavit, filed nine years after the riots, that he was present in a meeting on February 27, 2002, at then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi’s residence. In its 2015 order, the SC had dismissed Bhatt’s petition seeking an independent probe into the FIR lodged at Ghatlodia police station, Ahmedabad, by police constable K D Panth.\n\n> Panth had alleged that he was forced to sign on an affidavit prepared by Bhatt to prove that the latter was present in the meeting at Modi’s residence. Justice Gokani observed that the apex court order revealed “how the unholy nexus of certain officers with certain other planners led to the apex court dismissing the petition of forming SIT for investigating into the crime registered at Ghatlodia police station.”\n\n> The court said, “His (Bhatt’s) handshakes with various agencies to influence the SIT and course of justice in the case of Ms Jafri also exponentially revealed the extent to which everything was planned. Various observations made by the amicus curiae in relation to presence of Bhatt in the meeting held by the then Chief Minister on 27.02.2002 have been quoted, in fact, in extenso in the order impugned….”'

I don\'t know why BJP is twisting them so brutally.\n\nQuoting Tharoor,\n\n> Instead of "one nation, one tax" we have one nation, 3 GSTs, 6 rates\n\nAadhaar is basically India ki social security scheme, **definitely** helpful but why the fuck do we have to share the details with telcos is beyond me!\n\nMatlab aage se muh mein daal rahe aur piche se gaand mein!'

'I am from central Karnataka, back in the late 90\'s I was studying in a very mediocre school, not much in terms of exposure to world of books, one of my neighbor who was a Bachelor studying there was about to move back to his place (having completed his studies), he gave us all (cricket team.) a parting gift, which in itself was a first, basically things he didn\'t want to take back to his place, his cricket bat, wickets, basket ball, he gave me couple of "famous five" books, I was not really exited at first, but over the summer vacation I managed to finish the books, by the end of the year I had become a regular at our public library. \n\n\nThanks Prabir, you fucker (seriously, he was fucking the maid.)\n '
'How about for once we discuss about the suggestion itself and not turn this into a political circlejerk. But no, unending political stone-throwing ITT.'
"FFS Randians rise above your political hatred sometimes. Stop bringing cow or bjp into every fucking post. I know he's not the best person. But can we appreciate the idea of giving people a book instead of useless gifts, just the idea. I'd have loved it if my relatives gifted me a book instead of those recycled gifts. "
'And I appeal to your authoritarian party to stop banning books and movies. Liberal in the streets fascist in the sheets hain humare Modi kaka. '
'Some gift this fucker a Kamasutra with Pictures. That ought to finally get him to release that pent up sexual frustration on people other than minorities.'

"Randia is a tough crowd to please, they'd shit on anything Modi says."
"It's not a good idea. Everybody does not like books. I have no clue what kind of book my boss likes. Dull books are annoying because they take up space, and throwing them is very wasteful. Flowers thrown after a day? That's 40 bucks gone. Whatever. Good books cost hundreds. Throwing them is worse for the environment.\n\nBetter idea - buy food or wine. Nobody can say no to milk chocolates or a nice Shiraz."
'Depends on the kind of bouquets you need to buy. Flowers are disgustingly expensive. At least in cities. You could buy 2 wodehouse books for the cost of some bouquets. '
"Jaswant Singh was Vajpayee loyalist, who didn't  want Modi to be part of BJP, post Godhra Riots, in which Modi played his part. - The ugly truth behind the Patel insult theory.\n\nGandhi is a hated figure in the entire RSS terrorism group, so it's a no brainer why Gandhi books, with various interpretation, which the whole world reads, quotes and implements, is banned by a RSS henchman. - The ugly truth behind the cock and bull reason of insult."
"I don't care about the garble that Guardian and Scroll put out about my country."
"Of course the idea didn't come from him, it's been around for a long time, and if you go into the details of it there would be probably many more things used as gifts which must be bad for the environment."

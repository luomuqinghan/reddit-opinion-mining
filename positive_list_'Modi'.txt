Modi ji giving a bouquet instead of a book to presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind
BJP president Amit Shah’s son, Jay Shah, has seen a dramatic increase in some of his businesses since Narendra Modi became prime minister.
[ShowerThought] If BJP nominated Nathruram Godse for CM's post, BJP supporters would find reason to praise him as well.
Recently read this article about Narendra Modi's rise. Highly recommend it.
I appeal to people to give a book instead of bouquet as a greeting. Such a move can make a big difference: PM Narendra Modi
'I\'m gonna add some sources and data. One important distinction from headline and a TL;DR is:\n\n**- All existing 500 & 1000 rupee notes have to be turned over to the bank brefore December 30^th**\n\n**- New 2000 and 500 rupee notes will be brought into circulation "soon"**\n\nLinks: \n\n* Live stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmwQWe-jA_4\n* News articles: [NDTV](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-nation-tonight-at-8-pm-1622948) | [TheHindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/live-narendra-modis-address-to-nation/article9320548.ece) \n* **New Notes**: [Rs 2000](https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796004344617320448) | [Rs 500](https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796004629767036929)\n\nBullet points from Modi\'s speech:\n\n* We need to take a new solid step to fight black money. **From now on, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes will not be used. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices.**\n* **On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.**\n* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.\n* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11. \n* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.\n* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof\n* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value'
"Looks like Janardhan Reddy will have to rework his daughter's wedding arrangements."
"The surprise element is what really amazes me. It's good that Modi retained the surprise as much as possible. Even though the 2000 note was somewhat leaked I don't think anyone would have guessed that 500 and 1000 are being withdrawn. So the fake currency holders and black money hoarders got a huge blow for sure.\n\nHope this exercise bears a lot of fruit. "
'Fuck, this is a brave step. Kudos to the government.'
'This looks like a scene straight out of the Nayak movie..'
"I feel like I'm part of a revolution XD"
"The great thing about this is, no one saw this coming.   \n\nOn CNBC TV18 the way people are reporting, it seems that no one knew that govt will take such a step. Also Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC himself  mentioned 2 times how quietly did RBI manage to pull this! Hope It works.\n\n Edit : Even the Economic affairs secretary didn't see it coming so quietly! "
'This is a great step by Modi.\n\nSome highlights :\n\n* Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000  old notes will be discontinued from midnight. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices. Prior to that last day to turn old notes in RBI offices is 31st March 2017.\n\n* On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.\n\n* On November 9 banks will be closed for other public works\n\n* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.\n\n* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n\n* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n\n* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.\n\n* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof at RBI nodal offices.\n\n* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value.\n\n* The maximum amount comprising of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes which can be withdrawn in a day is restricted to Rs 2000 per day and Rs 10000 per week, this amount will be increased in coming days. \n\nPlease correct me If I am wrong.'
'Opening bank accounts for subsidies was an important step that enabled this.\n\nMastermind Modi!'
'I personally am so glad. All the holders of black money in the mattresses at home will suffer. I love what Modi is doing here.'
'This is absolutely brilliant by Modi. Best part about this was the secrecy. Such a massive operation carried out in complete secrecy. All of the banks, across India were informed about this and the "Media" couldn\'t even catch a glimpse.\n\nI can finally say I\'m proud of this government. \n\nThanks Modi!'

"If people can't surrender their black money, rupee value is likely to go up."
'r/madlads\n\nI, for one, welcome this move. Screw the black money hoarders. '
'People need to understand that this is to curb black money and corruption and to promote cashless transactions through cards and various types banking. \n\nIMO this great step but enforcement will be key which in India is a process that  moves at a snails pace.'
"Wow. Everything fits in. This was his plan all along. He kept throwing hints but no one caught it. This might sound like a fanboy thought but it does line up for me:\n\n- Right after getting elected, he announced Jan Dhan Yojna. Yes, bank officials would later on fake numbers by creating dummy account but he gave even the most poor a chance to come under the banking scheme.\n- Earlier this year, govt changed laws requiring jewellers to produce customer's tax documents for any purchase above 2 lacs.\n- He then allows people with black money to come forward. These people have to be the happiest bunch right now. They must be thinking that we took a great deal, even if it meant paying taxes.\n- Then, he does the unthinkable and makes a move very few people would have guts to make.\n- Even my uncles (who buy TV and cars in cash) are going to feel the pinch, and I'm loving it!  :D"
"Credit where it's due."
'Modi just secured the PMs chair in 2019'
'This is fucking huge. Swiss bank is the future guys. '

'I ~~withdrawed~~ withdrew ₹10,000 today evening, all in 500 & 1000 rupee notes, only to deposit the same amount back to the same bank I ~~withdrawed~~ withdrew it from fifteen minutes ago. \n\nAlso the lines outside banks and petrol pumps are fucking huge. \n\n\nEdit: corrected spellings'
'can anyone please give out an accurate way on how to deal with the fallout of this? What do I do with the 500, 1000 ruppee notes that I have?'
'All 500 notes = deposit in bank and get credited to your bank account, in return there will be a new 500 note. \n\nAll 1000 = deposit in bank and get credited to your bank account, in return there will be a new 2000 note\n\ndaily limit of exchange = 10,000\n\nyou can still put as much money as possible in your bank account like 1 lakh or 1 crore, no limit. \n\n\nall non cash transfers (cheques, cc, debit)  not affected by this. '
"I am a bit ambivalent at this. Isn't this going to affect a lot of the commercial units which deal mainly in cash transactions? \n\nAnd also, how fast would the replacement rate for the new ₹2000 notes will be?\n\nEdit: Ok the Hindu is saying a new series of ₹500, ₹2000 currency notes are going to being issued. ₹1000 notes to be issued no more. "

"I never thought about this as a solution to the black money, but this makes so much sense. I am also super surprised that this wasn't leaked on whatsapp as a forward months ago. \n\nGreat execution of a great plan. \n\nHate the way the new Rs. 2000 note looks though :( Hope the specimen is made more beautiful."
'How does this affect a average joe like me? '
'I am fucking overjoyed. This is lovely. Well done, Indian government, you finally regained some credibility.\n\nI was visiting local markets around the city to buy a bunch of snacks - 70% of shops all over the places were closed, even though it had been one of the most active business days here.\n\nIt is hilarious. The black-money hoarder literally got fucked in the arse, with an iron club, with KRK holding it.\n\nThe next few days are going to be really enjoyable. :D'

"The dung represents what this govt has done to 60-70 years of progress and development, although slow but in the right direction. \n\nIt's not something that can't be cleaned up, but if the cow is allowed to stay in the ATM booth for too long then it will be get harder to get the shit and stench out."
"Those who cannot afford to maintain unproductive cows, feel free to drop them at your local Sangh leader. They will take good care of our mothers, feed them with plastic and occasionally grass or rotten vegetables or old paper. \n\nOr may be they'll track the motherditching owner based on the CowAadhaar tag, and drop the fucking cow back at the owner's place."
'> I like cows. Beautiful, peaceful animals\n\n..and tasty'
'Unfortunately for some people, cities just simply grew around their farms. They swallowed whole villages in a blitzkrieg these people have never seen. I\'ve observed this in the numerous villages of delhi. Many were still debating how to deal with the expansion and things completely spiraled outside their homes. They didn\'t have the money to move with the times and the choicesbefore them were pretty tough. It was, either sell your land for some great price and lose your ancestral heritage and move out or live the same life in the middle of the urban chaos along with your cows and mud houses. people chose what suited them and there were pockets of delhi with villages in the middle of swanky offices and the nouveau riche. Slowly but surely, most villages are now selling out though. Places like Hauz khas village have lock stock and barrel rented out and sold property to clubs, cafe\'s, restaurants etc, who have still preserved the old look. It\'s an interesting transition imo. \n\nI\'m not advocating anything in particular though. These are simply my observations over the last 30 years. As we urbanize rapidly these scenes will remain common. Whether the ATM is infringing on the cow\'s space or the cow is infringing upon the ATM\'s, could turn out to be an interesting debate. I mean it in more philosophical way, of course in a literal sense the ATM operator owns the premises.\n\nI really don\'t care about the world "mocking" us either. We have to figure out what will make our urban transition peaceful and organized. For that we have to stop thinking in binary, good and bad, right and wrong. No switch flips in someone\'s head one day which makes him right from wrong. It\'s a slow transition. Think on the scale of generations. '

'"Swaach Bharath" (literally "clean India") is an initiative by the current government of India to create a sense of hygiene among Indians to keep their surroundings clean and free from garbage, and to discourage open defecations and encourage the use of public toilets by the poor. \n\nIt is mocked by Indians because the current PM of India actually just renamed a scheme of the previous government, while cutting funds for it, and indulging in publicity stunts to hide this fact. Naturally, implementation has never matched the hype generated. The cow dung inside the ATM booth highlights this failure.\n\nThe ATM (with an error message) itself is highlighting another failed initiative of our dear leader, DeMonetisation, where every Indian was declared as having untaxed money (black money) and were forced to personally acount for every penny he or she had by depositing all their cash in the bank to exchange it for new notes. The new notes had not been printed before hand, and there was shortage of cash, and a lot of Indians spent a lot of time in long queues in front of the ATM to get some cash in hand, which invariably ran out of cash quickly.\n\nThe cow is highlighting the unofficial beef ban imposed on India by our cow lover Prime Minister, who himself does not have any cow in his house, but wants us all indians to take care of a cow because he (and other religious fundamentalist friends of his) consider them a "holy animal".'

This movement is by the way will eventually succeed or at least will do some harm to the parochial nationalist narratives and image that BJP has been painstakingly building up since a long time. So, Modi is just delivering a lip services or he's trying as a part of a larger strategy to stem big civil societies' backlash and blowing off the steam of a possible big movement against it. \n\n\nNow, we can safely expect nothing substantial will happen on the ground."

Something about your post makes me uncomfortable... like you are seeing the actions of people, but only trying to interpret them through your own experiences and not really thinking about why these things might occur, given different realities of life in india vs. the west.  For the record, I also observe these issues you talk about (of people just doing what\'s needed to complete, only caring about getting paid).  And well understand the frustration it causes, collectively.  But I can understand this behavior why people do it, when I see there\'s some fundamental differences in life between the two places.\n\nI\'ve thought about it a bit recently, and like to share that with you, to give a different way of viewing it.  Maybe I am off base in my conclusions, but at least thoughts to consider.  First, how do we see work in the west?  It\'s my experience at least, that we grow with the main idea form childhood, "be what you want to be, you can be anything when you grow up, take chances and follow your dreams".  I enjoy that idea.  But the reality is there\'s more privilege to do that in the west (for the average person), than there is in India, because of less constraints from family/society, and social protections (if you fuck up and your dreams don\'t pan out, there\'s at least some protections from the government).  When you have spent your life viewing work from that way, it\'s a lot more natural to have \'pride\' in what you do.  In India, a lot of people are directed in to trades from a young high school age, for practical reasons, from family pressures, etc.  Did you know what you wanted to do with your life, when you were 16?  If you\'re shoehorned in to a career, find out later you don\'t like it, but feel little mobility opportunity, can you understand where it would be less likely to care about what you\'re doing?  And though I don\'t like that mindset as much, it makes a lot of sense why this is the mindset, when you think about it.  You are in India... you see the competition that exists, it surrounds you.  Would you want to take the chance to follow your dreams and be a painter if you\'re in Delhi?  Now what if all your family is against the decision, and you have the guilt of thinking it will impact them?  What if you\'re not from a rich family?  What happens if things go wrong and there\'s nothing to fall back on?  What if you\'re thinking of taking care of your parents and need a salary for that?  All I\'m trying to say here is, in the west we have a bit more privilege to look at work as something we aspire towards, and an opportunity to pursue dreams.   It\'s not that you can\'t do that in India, of course you can!  But there\'s inherently greater risk involved, and more perceived risks for those you care of, unless you\'re from a rich and liberal family..  I think India will get there, too.  Give it time.\n\nBeing a laborer in India is a whole different issue in and of itself. Can you put yourself in their shoes for a moment?  Can you imagine living that life?  You\'re doing hard labor, most people in the society look down on you, and you\'re faced with doing this day in day out the rest of your life to keep your family afloat?  The reality is, taking pride in what you do, going the extra step to perfect things has a cost for the person doing it, even if it\'s just additional time, additional thought.  I\'d probably be miserable too if that was my life, and over time, just want to get finished with the job as quick as possible.  I wouldn\'t be looking at it, as this great opportunity I chose, to create things and see that I\'m playing a role in society, I\'d probably be looking at it as, my goal is to keep my family from starving, this is the thing I\'m stuck with for the rest of my life with little room to do much else.  Not to mention most of society then treating me like crap and looking down because it\'s not seen as dignified.  Have you ever worked in a labor field?  I have.  I did take a lot of pride in my work.  But I eventually quit, too, and went a different career path, because it was miserably difficult and there were other options.  I can\'t imagine thinking it was my only option for all my life.\n\nI agree with you, that if you\'re working 10 hours a day doing something you hate and have no pride in, it\'s going to make for a miserable day.  I also agree, that if everyone has a bit more \'pride\', goes the extra mile, whatever, things all around work better.  But I can understand why these things happens, and just feel like a lot of this stems from the differences in how we look at work in our cultures, and those different ways of viewing work make sense given the different environment of both places.'
'Socially, India will take a long long time to come up. There is just too much cultural and societal pressures for many people to truly change. Everyone is worried about what others think.\n\n"What will everyone say if my son becomes a painter instead of an engineer or doctor? Who will marry him?"\n\n"What will our relatives think if they find out my son has schizophrenia/depression/anxiety issues/etc ?"\n\nIn this regard, the western society is far superior. Be whatever you want, do whatever you want, noone cares. If you have a mental disorder, go see a doctor/therapist and get it taken care of. '

I've been reading it for around six seven years, and 90% of their articles always have good things to say about Indian democracy, in the past, they've openly rooted for the Indian model of growth against China's. (Check out their covers from before the UPA corruption scandals began to emerge.)\n\nAnd, I would say, they're still pretty soft on Modi, considering the shit fest he's been running for three years now. You should see how they flay Trump, Putin, Erdogan and their own British leaders. "

Actor Prakash Raj questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the murder of Gauri Lankesh.\n\nA case has been registered against National award-winning actor Prakash Raj in a Lucknow court on a complaint lodged by a lawyer over his recent remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news agency ANI reported. The case is scheduled to be heard on October 7.\n\nOn Monday, Raj stirred up a storm after questioning the “absolute silence” of PM Modi on those “celebrating” the killing of journalist Gauri Lankesh. The actor, a close friend of the Lankesh family, said the prime minister and others were acting as if nothing had happened despite having social media followers celebrating the killing on social media.\n\n“Who killed my dear friend Gauri is not as important to me today as who has been celebrating her death. There may not be proof as to who killed Gauri but we can see who is celebrating it and from this we can form an idea of who could have killed her. The underlying cruelty in all of this is apparent to many people. Many of those celebrating Gauri’s death are persons followed by the Prime Minister on social media. The PM has been absolutely silent about these people,” Raj said while speaking at the 11th annual convention of left-affiliated students’ group Democratic Youth Federation of India.\n\nALSO READ: BJP hits out at actor Prakash Raj for criticising PM Modi\n\nHe went on to say that: “When we see these people going around acting as if nothing has happened, I feel like giving them the five National Awards I have won for acting.” “Look I am a seasoned actor, can I not see through the acting? Give me some respect. Am I stupid? Are people foolish that they cannot see through all this? Are the youth of today blind? The time has come for Modi to understand this,” Raj continued.\n\nSoon after his speech, reports emerged that Raj wants to give back his national award in protest against the killing of veteran journalist Gauri Lankesh. Rubbishing such reports, the actor clarified saying, “Well I can just laugh at the crawling on the newschannel that Prakash Raj has decided to give back his national awards. I am not such a fool to give back my national awards. It has been given to me for my body of work, which I am very proud of.”\n\nA popular actor in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil film industries, Raj has secured five National Film Awards for his movies.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

I mean what kid wants an FRI registered against them for posting a fucking meme?\n\nNot only that, Because of what happened to Amir, many other stars would be quite. Because of that kid in UP, many people like us are scared to post a fucking meme that even remotely criticizes glorious leader.\n\n\nSo, the message is clear.

"I am just trying to be constructive and write this with only good intent. \n\nIt is ok to criticise the decision makers and persons of public interest. It might even be tolerable to ridicule them in a satire to a certain extent. But ridiculing the followers of something/somebody will only stop the discussion, polarise the society more. I think it is neither wise not acceptable. We saw that in the US election. We see it often in UK election (silent tory). You suppress the opinion of a faction so much, that they are crowded out and you turn your surroundings in an echo chamber. And in the end neither you nor the opposition has ressources/surroundings to have a really constructive approach to discussion and better our opinions. I would like to urge those, who believe in democracy (and not in oligarchy), to please try and remain courteous and engage in meaningful discussion even to people having the opposite opinion than yours. \n\nYes, I also had my moments where I thought of supporter of my opposition being paid writers. Against Bernie Sanders, we even had proofs that there was millions of dollars spent in online trolling/brigading against the Berners. But still the strategy of the Berners was, that sinking to their level dosn't do any good in anycase. If the others are truly paid agents, they are winning by distracting you from the meaningful discussion. If they are honest netizens with their own point of view, you are killing the meaningful discussion.\n\nSo please, if you are really interested in having a sane society and discussion culture, stop with all that cheap insults, trolling etc when discussing something seriously. \n\nI've been called Bhakts, Kulcha-Warrior and what not just for voicing my true and honest opinion. The name calling didnot at all change my point of view. May be others were prevented from taking me seriously, but just as many others were probably also prevented voicing their opinion similar to mine. The instances my opinion changed, was when someone was seriously, honestly and respectably in conversation with me.\n\nAlso, I asked myself a lot and I am also throwing this question in this thread because I could not solve it yet:\nHow do you really find out, who is brainwashed and who is not? How do you distinguish between propaganda and real news? Because people nowadays use thess word against their opposition quite a lot.\n\nI truly hope the society does not polarise the way they seem on reddit. I'm trying to play my part to stop this madness.\n\nTo the subject of this thread: I truly believe, that one can not really grasp any positives or negatives of demonetization so soon. The scheme isn't even over yet. If you really want to cement your opinion based on Modi's monetization policy, you atleast need to wait a year before cementing you opinion. Also there is no hurry because the reelection of PM is not around the corner.\n"

'Genuinely curious. I have seen this "moving out" frequent here. Does it really come in action? Or is it new "oh my god", just to type?'
'There are many ways to move out, but moving out to an English speaking nation is not very easy.\n\nThe easiest English speaking nation to immigrate to is Canada but that too only if you are going the masters route. Even though it\'s the easiest way to immigrate, it still isn\'t very easy and will require spending 4-5 years struggling for it.\n\nEasiest non-English-speaking and still relatively well off country would be Brazil in my opinion. They are actively looking for immigrants for some reason and there are many ways to get in there. I\'m keeping this as the last resort, in case I fail to get into Canada (even though I might not fail because things are looking organized and well planned for me).\n\nYes, it\'s not as good as some of the English speaking countries where people usually immigrate to, but Brazil is miles ahead of India when it comes to average happiness Index. Their official slogan should be "Pop ~~and~~ *a beer and chill". Pretty chilled out nation. Also, I love watching soccer.\n\nAlways have a backup plan for big career decisions(Brazil, in my case) . Am not even marrying until I\'m out of India because you cannot sign a prenup in India and one divorce and my career will get fucked because of fucking alimony. Am gonna be young only for a few years, can\'t fucking risk with getting in a financial mess in those precious 4-5 years that I got.\n\nFor canada there are basically two ways, first is CEC (Canadian Experience Class). It is basically the easiest way. You have to go in as a student, study there for some time and you will be given the same amount of time to find a job as the time it took to get you a degree (i.e you can legally be inside for that period of time). If you get a job then you can apply for Permanent Residence and if you get PR, then it becomes very easy to become a citizen, but getting PR will depend on a lot of factors.\n\nI don\'t remember the name of the second programme to get into Canada (because I\'m not aiming for it), but it is when you already have some skills which the country is actively looking for, then you can apply via this program and based on your profile you will be awarded some points and based on those points they will decide whether you can qualify for that programme or not, if you do qualify, then you have to find a job in Canada, and stay there for I guess two years (not sure about this) before you can apply for PR. Once you get PR, it\'s comparatively easier to become a canadian citizen.\n\nThere is a third way for Canada as well, I guess it is something to do with provincial sponsorship programme. Particular provinces are looking for some specific skills and if you meet them then you can apply via their respective programme. They expect you to stay in that province for a few years after immigration though, which in my opinion is worth it. Anywhere in Canada is better than India to be honest.\n\nNot sure about AUS and ENG, but being commonwealth countries have some advantages, but I don\'t know how easy or difficult is to get in these nations. I cannot provide any information because of particular reasons I am not targeting these countries.\n\nFor USA. Boy, is it a mess? The thing is that US wants to maintain the cultural diversity of the nation, but does not want too many from the same nation to immigrate in the country as that will cause imbalance in the cultural diversity towards one particular ethnicity. Therefore, they limit their entry only to some limited numbers per nation. The problem here now is that the amount of people who apply for their Green cards is huge from India and China because overpopulation, and since US can accept only a few people from one Ethnicity, therefore it becomes very difficult for Indian and Chinese people to immigrate. If you apply now then you would be a part of the ever increasing queue of applicants, so it might be years before you become the citizen of USA, and even after waiting it might get rejected and you might never become a citizen, so USA is really very difficult. Also the different types of Visa mess is actually a thing. You could be stuck in those forever, which is why I ticked USA out of my list.\n\nCanada made the most sense for me to be honest. I\'ve got a great job currently in India which pays me in 7 figures annually (Rupees of course), so I might save some money and do my masters when it\'s time. I\'m pretty young (20) so that helps. Things might be different for you.\n\nDo some research and find out whatever way works the best for you.\n\nEdit : One advice above all. Develop some insane skills, because to be very honest, it makes things much easier. Either have insane skills, or be extremely rich. Think from the perspective of the country taking you in. If you don\'t have either, then you are just another person who will take over country\'s resources, and they have no reason to take you in. The only reason they are taking you in is if you can provide them with valuable skills or invest some money in their country. Yes, you are going there to contribute to their country over yours, and you have to accept that you are being selfish and as some people might call "anti-national". You just have to be aware of these things and be practical about them.\n\n**TLDR : Brazil, Canada easier to immigrate, Don\'t know about AUS and UK; USA immigration is a mess, but worth it if you can do the hard-work required(if you can do the needful, lol (\\^_\\^) )** '

'Modi was responsible for the big bang as well'
'Kochi metro was well executed under the leadership of DMRC. Both state and Central govt cooperated well on the project. I will say the political credit goes to the former  Kerala CM Omman Chandy . it was his pet project. And 90% of the project was completed under his regime. \n\nCurrent CM Pinarai Vijayan went on to say Modi gave all the support to the project. So Kochi metro is a well executed project irrespective of the political spectrums. We need to be happy that we are getting a world class metro rail but we are focusing on who is taking the credit and who to blame. Typical randia.  '
'I just hope development goes on regardless of who claims to take credit.'
'>It was expected to start by 2006 and complete by 2010. But the project was delayed because the Central Government expressed serious doubts about the economic viability of the project.[11] In 2008 LDF Government under the Chief Minister V. S. Achuthanandan approved the Kochi Metro rail project in a cabinet meeting held on 2nd January 2008 and sent to Central Government for ratification. The Kerala government hoped the Centre would approve a funding structure similar to that used for the Delhi Metro, but they were turned down.[13] The Union Government supported using public–private partnership (PPP) on the build-operate-transfer model.[14] The LDF state government wanted it to be in public sector, which was not accepted to the Central Government. The victory of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the 2011 Kerala legislative assembly elections, changed the scenario in the state[15] and it was decided that the Kochi Metro would follow the Chennai Metro and Delhi Metro models, and would be implemented on a joint venture basis, with investments by the Central and State Government. A Cabinet decision was taken to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. (KMRL) as per orders from Planning Commission and the Union Government for the implementation, operation and maintenance of the metro project. The Public Investment Board (PIB) cleared the project on 22 March 2012 subject to final approval by the Union Cabinet.[17] The Union Government\'s share of the cost would be 20.26%, or ₹1,002.23 crore (US$160 million).[18] On 28 March 2012, at a KMRL board meeting, the decision was taken to entrust the Kochi Metro rail project work to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The number of metro stations on the line was set at 22.[19][20] On 3 July 2012, Union Government gave final clearance to the project. Then Managing Director of KMRL, Tom Jose said, "Now we will sit down with our valued partner, DMRC, and chalk out the way forward, obtaining advice and guidance from former DMRC Chief, E Sreedharan. We aim to complete the project within a span of 3 to 4 years." [21]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Metro\n\nSurely it could\'ve been completed way before in 2010-12 but no one is going to question the previous government about the delay. Public welfare projects being delayed for 5 to 8 years is so normal in India afterall that we are used to it.'

"Good on you, mate. It is extremely important to understand that a democracy is filled with several voices, that have several opinions. While tolerance of people that look to propagate messages of hate and violence should be corrected, legitimate views on making our country stronger and better must always be welcome, irrespective of which end of the political spectrum it comes from. For a large population of our country, the politics don't matter. For them, it's about helping them increase their standards of life and reaching levels of development they have a right to (whether it's education or employment or even simply, help with their agriculture). Unfortunately the trolls don't get that. Stay strong and let's hope that we're one day able to respect and accommodate differing views and opinions, as a democracy should. "

As such, controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938) and Joseph Stalin (1939/42) have appeared on the front cover.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year\n\n>Despite the magazine\'s frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.[4] However, Time magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957) and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts.\n\n\n>Time magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of Time. \n\nI don\'t see how Modi has biggest impact on the year\'s news. His retarded bhakts are seeing this as an award or a honour and voted him. Time\'s person of the year belongs to Trump.  '
"Such 'best person' lists often lack legitimacy due to the kind of figures that get nominated, voted for and ultimately chosen. I wouldn't think any more than this than when Kejriwal ended up in Fortune magazine's 50 greatest leaders list for his failed Odd-even scheme."
'Every year, TIME selects the most influential person of the year, noting, **for better or for worse**, the person or group of people who have had the largest global impact over the past 12 months.\n&nbsp;\n\nMODI MODI MODI!'

'TIME magazine has been rated as the best magazine by UNESCO.'
"These Readers Poll's mean nothing.  \n\nIf anyone argues with you too much, just tell them Arvind Kejriwal won it before Modi"
'I believe Time person of year should be "YOU" again. After all, it\'s YOU who voted to keep britain out of EU and it\'s YOU who voted in Trump. YOU are the ones responsible for 2016 being 2016. Good job YOU!!!'
'Its not purely based on voting, the editor has the final say. Few years ago Kim Jong got most votes but the actual winner was Obama.\n\nhttp://newsfeed.time.com/2012/12/13/and-the-winner-of-times-person-of-the-year-reader-poll-is/'
'> you are in a shitload of trouble if you are on the open internet and are trying to win a volume based battle against the Indians.\n\nI wish this could be used for actual national interest rather than Internet polls.'
'"Person of the year" is not a positive or negative thing. It\'s just a title for the person who had the most impact on the world.\n\nModi had a massive impact on 1/7th of the world\'s population, though if I\'m honest, the person who impacted the WORLD the most this year would be Donald Trump. We are entering a new reality and a new era, all thanks to Trumpism'
"> win a volume based battle \n\nisn't what poll is all about?"
'To be honest it does say "Readers Poll" Times Person of the Year and dare I say he deserved it. '
'Reminds me of that time on a hindi singing talent show would adjudge the best singer on basis of national votes. Well ofcourse that punjabi guy won. He was good, no issues there. But there were better contestants. Later karma got back with him. '
'How many Indians have won this poll in the past? '
'Assange easily deserves it more than either Trump or Modi. '
'Would you say the same if Trump or Assange would have made it to the top... Sounds like a whine.'
'Wow mates.'

'Woah..careful there going on like that on this sub..'
'Do you honestly think he has had a bigger impact on the world stage than Donald Trump ?'
'[They both won the same title, so the comparison is fully deserving.](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760539,00.html)'

"let there next be a poll for deciding India's entry into UN security council with the veto power ;)"
'Well that is more because the eventual answer in a "Harambe" or "Boaty McBoatface" kind of fashion was a troll answer. The votes for Modi are NOT troll votes, but genuine outpouring for the first real leader that our country has seen in 20 years. Sure, many of the voters may be blind towards his flaws, but in a post Trump world - Time is going to learn to respect the mandate of the people.'
"Trump shocked the world simply by winning despite the kind of campaign he ran and the kind of reactions he got worldwide. That said it doesn't make him 'most influential' yet. I think TIME should wait for him to actually hold office as President before deciding on this."
"Yeah but Time doesn't really like trump and don't want to give him another win. Yeah I know hitler also won this particular honour but it would still count as an achievement.   "
"Why do you think so? Right now 300M people of America have a disproportionate share of noise, don't they."
'They do the readers poll to drive traffic and publicity.  The person of the year is pretty much the only reason Time Magazine is still in business.  Why would they turn off a huge population of potential site visitors just to make the poll more "accurate".  These things are a farce anyway.  '
'I think every time there is a strong Indian leader, they will win this poll'
'Cherry on the top will be Akhilesh throwing shades on Rahul for the loss.'
"Unless they fuckup UP badly in the next 2 years, it seems likely Modi has 2019 locked up.\n\nThis also makes me a bit optimistic that they won't take UP for granted and actually put up a decent cm candidate + actually try to get some investment here, as they have to retain their hold here.\n\nFor the opposition, congress needs to do what it should've done before '14, distance itself from the gandhis, but fat chance of that happening. \n\nAkhilesh despite the loss enjoys decent popularity in UP, but Shivpal and the like will try to pin the loss on him, it'll be interesting to see where that goes. \n\n"
"Since the live thread has been locked, I'll post here. Credit to Chanakya for the exit poll results. Got it spot on for UP.\n\nEdit: Got banned for God knows what. Nice knowing you r/india for the last 5 years."
"Regarding demonitization, I feel that people were more affected by the fact that a government can take such a strong step than the step itself and that is what is helping BJP and Modi now. \n\nBesides, his PR has been really good. AAP may have done some good things in Delhi but Kejriwal kept on making a fool of himself by his continuous bitching about Modi, which, frankly, became cringeworthy (looking at *What's the deal Modiji?* ). \n\nThen admit it or not, Modi has been successful in his foreign policies, the world is noticing India and our relevance has certainly increased. If they do not fuck up this strong mandate and keep working towards better taxation, stronger growth and manufacturing, lowering corruption and more transparency then 2019 is totally in BJP's pocket without doubt.\n\nAnd yeah, fuck Congress. They're ded."
'Itna aage ka mat socho, enjoy the Great Salt Day-3 today'
'Is [this true](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6nLBCmWcAImf0f.jpg) or photoshopped? I saw this doing rounds on social media.\n\nIf this indeed is true, the AAP workers have a lot to work on. I was expecting Punjab but Goa?'
"I liked Omar Abdullah's comment. He said opposition might better start preparing for 2024 instead of 2019 looking at the current trends. Atleast he's humble enough to accept that there is a BJP wave across the country."
'Yes this was the semifinals before 2019. An absolute decimation of SP in UP by the BJP. '
'I hope they try to break up the state into 2-3 pieces so that it can be governed better '
'Remember 2004 . BJP and Modi did not stopped working hard till  last day of election . There is a reason Modi spent 3 days in Varanasi . Do not assume that you will win . If BJP and RSS workers continue working hard then definitely BJP will win in 2019 . '
"Don't ask if Modi will win in 2019 or not; ask who is the worthy one who can oppose him?"
"Opposition in India is a joke. But I respect democracy, so it seems 2019 is locked as even if bjp fucks up again, it won't matter."
'I am more surprised about Punjab results'
'There is still no trace of any competition from other parties. He might win with even bigger mandate. '
'As i said 2 weeks ago, we won in 2014 and we again win in 2019. \n\nCongratulations to all BJP party members and Other Indians.'
'Very very good signs for Modi. The key to retaining majority for Modi is UP as it would be difficult to recover too many seats from a fall of seats in UP (from 73). But, this shows that the popularity of Modi in UP is quite high and the fall at this stage will be quite small.'
'Unlike the steak socialists of randia ( calling them so because of their obsession of showing how edgy they are by eating beef) most people were not affected by demonetization beyond a month. And the people who are used to queuing in front of ration shops and have an average wealth of 5000 rupees were not negatively impacted. \nIn Modi people see a person who is trying to do something. His equivalents are PIS in Poland and the Conservatives under Theresa May. just like r/uk and r/europe tend to be in meltdown as to why brexit happened and it is britain committing suicide demonetization will not hurt that much in reality just like with brexit the sky has not fallen down.'
'> After demonetisation, many felt that Narendra Modi would have a tough time in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n LOL wut? '
'BJP has not broached the topic so far but I hope with this mandate, they actually split the state into four by 2019 or at least the next state election. UP needs to be split for the sake of the country'
'Well, we can safely say 2019 is going to be a non-contest, Modi is returning to power. Rahul Gandhi needs to realise the only good he can do is set up internal elections in Congress, dismantle the high command and let regional leaders lead local party activities - case in hand, Punjab.'
'Certainly hope so.'
'yes, and no.\n\nYes it is locked up. \n\nNo, he would have locked it in without UP.\n\nModi and his team get modern politics better than their opposition. They would win 2019 anyway.'
'People of UP are convinced about the Muslim favouritism....so they voted for a party that dint have even one Muslim leader \nThe most popular watsapp forward in UP is of Muslim becoming majority by 2050.\nEdit:\nAlso.....Hard work is better than Harvard'
'I think this is the best outcome India,as a country, could have asked for. \n\nBjp wins two states in a decisive fashion - giving them impetus to do better by 2019 and Congress wins 3 states, keeping them relevant.  \n\nA democracy without effective opposition cannot function. '
"I really believe it now.Demo was the make or break thing and the nation has wholeheartedly embraced it.\n\nIts not about whether the decision was successful or not but govt exercising such obscene power over a country , it maybe within constitution but felt supremely dictatorial.\n\nAnd the way they were so  frivolous with people's money ,it will never sit right with me.Went back on their own word, altered rules every second day, it was one hell of shitshow.\n\nBut clearly the faith in Modi is so intense all this was overlooked.    "
'Hard to say. Indian elections are inherently unpredictable and a lot can change in 2 years. For example in 2014 even with the euphoria over the historic Lok Sabha verdict even most BJP supporters did not expect that Amit Shah would be able to sustain such a performance till the UP assembly elections in 2017.'
'Hello, as an American I came across this headline:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/03/11/asia/uttar-pradesh-elections/index.html\n\nThe headline was "Why these Indian state elections matter to the whole world", but the article does nothing to describe the WHY part. Can anyone maybe give some insight into why Modi winning would affect the rest of the world, or why other countries should have any thoughts on this election?\n\nI\'m just really curious what the political situation in India is like! Is Modi a right wing guy, a left wing guy, are people generally happy with him, do people hate him, or is it about even?\n\nWhat are his proponents saying about him, and what are him opponents also saying? \n\nThanks for any feedback!'
"I am worried about Goa. Will we continue get weed? Please don't fuck up Goa. "
"If there's one party I feel sorry for, it's the BSP. Despite Mayawati's faults, she did not deserve a result as poor as this one. Her governance was far superior to the SP. "
"Looks right now. We don't have any solid opposition leader. If AAP had won in Punjab, at least Kejri could keep Modi somewhat in check. No other leader in my sight right now. "
"I think it's been a great day for Congress. The rumours of their death have been greatly exaggerated - They seem to be taking Punjab. In Manipur & Goa, never thought they would do well. Great show!"
'Now that BJP has its Rajya Sabha majority, can we please get the promised golden age of India?'
"I'm happy with Congress performance. Nobody expected them to win UP. But they regained Punjab, Goa and held Manipur. Overall quite good."
"This result might deflate Akhilesh's rising star. Hopefully it'll lead to a split of the party so that SP can never come back again.\n\nWhat UP and the nation needs is a better second option to BJP."
"I am curious about whether they are going to try to do anything about that now. They're in power at both state and centre, all that's left is to resolve the Babri court case."

'I am reading this book right now, and I really like what Ambedkar said \n\nThe second warning concerned the unthinking submission to charismatic authority. Ambedkar quoted John Stuart Mill, who cautioned citizens not ‘to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with powers which enable him to subvert their institutions’. This warning was even more pertinent here than in England, for in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be the road to the salvation of a soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.'

'At least the Washington Post was kind enough to refer us as "Indians". '

"The thing is, India is like a country which has many countries within it. Each state has a different tradition, and some states' traditions include the consumption of beef. Even the Hindus there eat beef. In my opinion, laws which prevent them from eating beef are taking away their traditions which are centuries old. "
"Yeah but Britain is one country as big as a medium sized Indian state, with a largely homogeneous culture throughout. There are many, many distinct cultures in India and sweeping laws like that go against the ideals this country was founded on. It's almost like other cultures  can be vastly different from your own you know. "

"I do take your point, and it's well argued. \n\nBut sometimes the price we pay for living in a harmonious society is to accept the irrational foibles of our countrymen.

'Kerala communism is actually capitalistic with welfare safety net for citizens and liberal on social issues.'

"You take someone's pet dog and eat it, you might get shot by it's owner. The WaPo article is reporting what is happening, it's not an opinion piece.

"China is a huge country. Not everyone who's Chinese in america has eaten dog meat or come in contact with dog meat. In China too, not everyone eats dog meat.

"I'm in US, and to be honest, I've seen both sides. I've seen liberal and progressive Muslims, who strongly believe in gender equality, against purdah, and also celebrate and eat prasads at Hindu festivals and even sell statues and puja samagris. There are some who are even Gandhians and vegetarian.\n\nI've also seen other Muslims who are extremists and keep trying to evangelically convert others by giving religious sermons. And everyone in between.\n\nI generally have a policy - judge people by their values, and not which team they belong to, and I certainly don't generalize all Indian Muslims or Pakistanis and will stand up against discrimination towards them. But I also don't give anyone a free pass just because someone belongs to a minority. I think that is fair and everybody can agree."
"Electing Modi to power doesnt equal to Hating Pakistanis or Muslims....\n\nI'm sure than more than 50% of those who voted for Modi didnt vote for bringing a Ram rajya and taking revenge on Muslims for what the Mughals and Ghazni etc did to them....\n\nThey voted because of the scams done by congress and no good alternative...If Modi doesnt perform,he will be thrown and someone else will be elected... \n\nI'm in US and when I was in NY,one of my favorite eating joint was a pakistani restaurant....They were very friendly and they used to put a little extra when I ordered ..... \n\nAlso I've seen that many pakistanis are very cagey when they approach Indians because they are afraid of us ..."
'Was in a NY restaurant few months back, my colleague was confused and taking too long to decide what to order, when the manager of the place who happened to be from Pakistan overhead us so he came over and just said let me get food for you that I think you will like. That was one of the best meals we had in a long time. The way he spoke to us with such warmth, addressing us as "Bhaijaan". To be honest, I come across many Indians at several places but just don\'t feel the same. '
'I meet and chat with a Pakistani from "azaad kashmir" every time I go offsite. He was kind of weird at first, but he\'s super nice and has helped me many times. '
"Indians and Pakistanis seek each other our and become friends. Even turn into each others support system. I have seen it in France, UK, US, UAE and Australia.  \n\nBasically because Goras and Arabs don't care a shit about either. So they just have each other.    "
'I really had awesome butter chicken and nan at this restaurant in Bangkok. It was run by Pakistani brothers and he gave us priority service ignoring all the white people who came before us.  Unlike India, where whites are treated like Gods. We chatted a bit and discussed about lives at both side of the borders. It was really an eye opening experience.'
"Off topic but I had to post.\n\nThis is my experience as a Punjabi who has travelled a bit: \n\n- Pakistanis: have a special affinity towards Punjabi Indians. My brother who looks Persian by all accounts always attracts Pakistanis and Iranians from far and wide who think - oh ye to apna banda hai. Like I have seen them break supermarket queues to come say Hi to him. It doesn't matter when they later find out he's a Hindu. Any Pakistani bus or taxi driver is open and friendly. Two Pakistani guys showed interest in me which all came to abrupt end once the words 'magar hamare Islam mein...' and 'haan magar Aamir Khan to Muslim hi hai na' were uttered.\n\n- Afghanis and Iranians: love Indians! General topic of discussion that unites us is our contempt for Pakistanis, and 'love' of Hindi movies. The Afghani driver didn't fail to point out though that, oh but Hindus have so many gods..\n\n- Sri Lankans: Sinhalese don't mix with Tamilians even with SL Tamilians and, have a special hatred for India obviously. Melbourne is apparently the capital of SL expats and the Sinhalese that I know are really sweet people except that they really really *really* dont like India. After lots of observations my conclusion is that - India is the big brother. These guys think that India is a bully - kinda weird feeling when you realise that India is seen as powerful by some people. Who'd a thunk it? I will never support SL in any match, except against Australia.\n\n- Bangladeshis: These guys are Bongs before anything else. I have seen that Hindu Bengalis and Muslim Bangladeshis are really really, fiercely,  proud of their Bangla culture and are frequently socialising with each other. On a number of occasions one of these Bangladeshi aunties have told me, why would you want to leave India? It is so beautiful? After talking to her I fully believe that part of her family is now living illegally in India. Her relatives were in the army fighting for the Pakistani side in '71, so she has special reason to NOT be in India. \n\nConclusion: The Indian subcontinent is real. Kids of India, but especially north India, who have grown up being exposed to all Indians - Punjabis, Gujratis, Sindhis, Bengalis, Tamilians etc - the people, the language, the culture, the food - We will be able to find something in common with everyone from the subcontinent. All the more reason to preserve and celebrate all our languages and cultures and while realising how incredibly strong we are in unity. The other countries in the subcontinent are too homogenous, and are intimidating by differences. \n\n(Sorry I just saw Dangal - sniff - so emotional. Jai Hind, Jai Maharashtra.)"
"I've met a lot of nice Pakistanis just like I've met a lot of nice Brits, Americans, Aussies, Bangladeshis etc but I've never had the smug satisfaction of making a preachy self post about it... probably because I judge people independent of their heritage"
"Off-course! We're basically the same. I grew up in the Middle East then went to US for uni. I had bunch of Pakistani friends since I was a kid. We spoke in Punjabi. Our languages are almost identical other than the dialects across Punjab. We share the same culture. \n\nI remember back in college, my Pakistani buddies and I would get shitfaced on the weekend and listen to Urdu and Punjabi poetry, Nusrat Sahab, Hans Raj Hans, Gurdas Maan, Junoon etc. This is the cultural bond we have! Specially the regions of Delhi, Punjab and UP have waay too much common with the Pakistani population!\n\n Aint no border can separate this for long. Peace is inevitable. "
'1 like = 1 respect '
'Individuals are mostly good unless they are ideologically fanatic. But when they become part of the mob problem starts.

"A lot of ppl will brand me a bhakt or a psychopath for saying this but I'll say it anyway.\n\nThe idea of Akhand Bharat has merit. Hinduism and Vedic philosophy are the perfect catalyst to offset the more crazier aspects of abrahamic religions and create a uniform philosophy working beyond boundaries of religion and social structures which can appeal to all as a singular philosophy.\n\nWe already see some variants of this core philosophy or attempts to achieve it from the creation of Sufism, Sikhism and Din-i-alahi along with the works of ppl like Darah Shikoh, Ghalib, Sai baba etc.\n\nThere is a reason the powers that be sought to egg on Partition, simply because they wanted us to be separated and constantly fighting over artificial borders. This is isnt just about geopolitics and power of nation states but about control over the human psyche and philosophy itself. \n\nThe Indian Subcontinent and Indochina states are unique in the sense that they somehow manage to find a balance between Vedic, Buddhist, Confucian and Abhramanic religions. I cant explain exactly how but its there, its happening and its been happening for a long time.\n\nThe day we remove these artificial borders and unite the whole region from Iran to Indonesia into one cohesive unit, it will act as an example to show that it is in fact possible to get over the boundaries of race, caste (social structure) and religion for good."
'A lot of people are dissing the OP for callling Pakistanis as the same as us. Some even said we need to judge Pakistan on its action as a state.

"Except that we're not the same people. We were at some point but we're not anymore. Each society is held together by myths (not in a religion term but more in a societal term) and markers that form the underpinnings of their culture. For example, partition is the foundational myth of India and Pakistan but they're both two fundamentally different myths of the same event. Sure we have markers and myths that overlap, such as good etc, but the ones that seem to really bins the two societies in their own countries together are fundamentally different. \n\nSo for me, a good rule of thumb is to be happy we share a great many markers and be happy that I found people (form anywhere really) who show me kindness and respect. And i tend to judge them on an individual basis because people tend to behave and adapt based on their surroundings too. Give each person the benefit of being an individual is pretty much my mantra.

India actually added about 4GW in 2016 (calendar year). The 3GW number I put was extrapolation of the nine month FY data. Secondly, it is expected we will add about 9GW in 2017 calendar year.

'Keep in mind that generation is not the same thing as installations.

"> By coupling together the last two years, you are being misleading\n\nI will leave it to the people to think if it's misleading or not - what is misleading is the linked article which doesn't give overall context or improvements over the year. \n\n> Modi's government is on track to do worse on their stated goals in 2016-17 than they were last year\n\nYou are right on this. There is no doubt performance has declined in 2016 compared to 2015\n\n> In other words, their execution performance is declining. This is even more bizarre given that the costs of solar is falling year over year and that India has received more FDI\n\nI agree with you on the first part. However for the second part you are assuming money was the bottleneck. I don't know enough to tell if it's correct or not. One possible very important factor is the [WTO ruling against India](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/dPX7vDr1SaGmzoT2X1wDPI/Indias-appeal-against-WTO-solar-ruling-rejected.html). This is what I would have assumed the media to have done - find out *why* did the performance decrease. It might also turn out that the projects stated to complete in Q4 2016 got delayed till Q1 2017. Again - not enough data to tell if they are really slipping *in the long run*\n\n> capacity additions should do better as a percentage of the target in the current \n\nNot if the targets were ambitious. 2015 was first full year and targets were 2000MW. 2016 was second full year and targets were 12000MW - 6x increase! So it is not necessary that percentages should increase, 2016 was clearly a stretch goal. "
'data does matter, what i am saying is , IF it were congress right now, it wouldn\'t be doing any better.\n\nas for modi\'s decision, i think you can see "crashing the economy" was in Hindsight better than not crashing, and letting it crash under its own weight.\n\nP.S. i am far from modi bakt, but he gives more hope than anyone else right now.'
">  Solar and Wind are close to grid parity \n\nHow is this achieved only in India? No other report outside of India says it's anywhere close. What's so special about Indian solar?    \n\nMy feeling is that, it's achieved parity for the vendors because of subsidies. I don't think in reality it's close to parity for the country."
'He should have then aimed for 50 GW, then may be we would have reached 10 GW. Lost opportunity. '
'>Energy minister Piyush Goyal is sure that the 175gw target will be met. "India is moving rapidly towards realising the clean energy vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Goyal said earlier this year on the micro-blogging site Twitter. Bolstered by the progress, in May, Goyal said that he was considering an upward revision for 2022 solar target.\xa0\n\n\n\nFrom [here](http://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-renewable-energy-targets-catch-the-attention-of-global-investors-still-need-ground-work/articleshow/53015707.cms). A casual google search, or even the constant barrage on twitter, will make anyone believe India is on track to become the next renewable energy powerhouse. I do understand the fact that Modi is, at the very least, *trying.* However, take any news like these with a pinch of salt. '

"> Anyone interested in mass propaganda, PR or even marketing should study the Nov 8th to Dec 30th period. You are witnessing a master in action of the public discourse.\n\nnot really. demo sailed through without major harm to BJP or Modi because the image of Modi that was carefully constructed over the years - essentially a bachelor, no children, hard working, incorruptible, hindutvawadi, jingositic, decisive, etc. which appeals to his base. that is what has floated BJP's boat so far through demo."
"Hey,\n\nFirst of all, thanks. Its very refreshing to have a discussion with actual data. Secondly, yes the installed capacity is not the same as generation. However, all the targets I could find on MNRE deal with generation and not capacity.\n\nFinally, livemint might have newer data but official numbers of the 1965 MW installation is for a duration of 6 months (and not the entire year). I don't expect this to see a significant jump, though if the trend follows, this should still be higher than 2015-16."
"> we get that\n\nWe? Who are we? Are you taking your medications, bro? Those voices inside your head is just you.\n\n> We totally understand\n\nAwkard.\n\n> Who cares if he gave a 100 GW target or not\n\nYeah, who gives a shit about accountability. Solid argument man. As I pointed out earlier; to bhakts... data, facts and accountability doesn't matter.\n\nGoalshifting, or in your case getting rid of the goal altogether, is forgivable as long as Modi is excused and protected. Such people are not deserving to be taken seriously. "
"Yes it's not the real gird parity in the strict sense in India. Although it's happening in many markets.\n\nhttps://www.db.com/cr/en/concrete-deutsche-bank-report-solar-grid-parity-in-a-low-oil-price-era.htm\n\nIn India, tax subsidies do play a part. Especially the accelerated depreciation which has made wind and solar cheaper. However we have got subsidies on coal as well for many of the power plants who were given mines cheaper or have a preferred links with Coal India. It's difficult to compare like on like. "

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**We’ve waited 70 yrs for you, Israeli PM tells Modi as he lands in Tel Aviv** \n\n ______ \nTEL AVIV: "We have waited for 70 years for you," Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu greeted PM Narendra Modi soon after his aircraft touched down to an effusive welcome that saw Modi reciprocating the warmth, saying his visit marked a "path breaking journey of engagement".As Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Israel, a late afternoon sun beat down on the red carpet at a secluded corner of Ben Gurion airport. As Air India One taxied up, Netanyahu was waiting at the bottom of the steps and Modi, dressed in a cream bandhgala, lightly ran down and both men enveloped each other in a bear hug."Aapka swagat hai mere dost," Netanyahu said as the leaders hit the right notes. Modi returned a "shalom" and said in Hebrew that he was delighted to be in Israel.Netanyahu said, "We love India. We admire your culture, history, democracy and commitment to progress. I am confident of the real mathematics of life, of success of our partnership for many reasons, talent of our people."Modi touched upon a personal memory of Netanyahu\'s — Tuesday was the 41st anniversary of the Entebbe raid to save 94 Israeli hostages held in Uganda — an operation that claimed the life of the Israeli leader\'s elder brother. "Your heroes are an inspiration for the younger generations," Modi said.The PM was greeted by leaders of all major religions here — Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jew, Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Catholic and Muslim — a ritual that is only reserved for the Pope or the US president. Netanyahu led Modi through introductions with his cabinet and senior officials.When Modi introduced his delegation beginning with NSA Ajit Doval, Netanyahu said he was glad the visit had come to fruition. "You had something to do with it," he told Doval.In his welcome remarks, Netanyahu reminded Modi that he had said "the sky is the limit for India and Israel". "We are working together in space programmes, so we can now say the sky is not the limit anymore," he said. Acknowledging Modi\'s love for acronyms, Bibi delivered one of his own, "I-square-plus-T-square — India and Israel plus Israeli technology and Indian talent, is India-Israel ties for tomorrow."Modi\'s tried his hand at Hebrew with a "Shalom le kulaam ani semya mayodh lehiyot po (I am delighted to be here)." The PM\'s appreciation of Israel clearly came through. "The people of Israel have built a nation on democratic principles. They have nurtured it with hard work, grit and the spirit of innovation. You have marched on regardless of adversity and converted challenges into opportunity. India applauds your achievements," he said."In our path of sustained high growth and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners. The need to rely on science, technology, innovation, and higher technical education to overcome our developmental challenges is common to both of us," Modi added.Both leaders clearly bonded at a personal level, which came through at the airport ceremony. Over the next couple of days, the two men will spend virtually all their waking moments together.Later, Modi visited a flower farm, where he was given a chrysanthemum named after him. The business end of the visit had begun with a briefing on cutting edge agricultural technologies. A little later, Modi paid a symbolically significant visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, which has a hall with the name of 4.6 million victims of Nazi terror.Michael Oren, former Israeli envoy to the US and a senior minister in Netanyahu\'s office, told TOI, "India and Israel share democratic values and our partnership is important for development. Also, as the US begins to turn away, its important for us to look out for each other."In his interaction, Netanyahu welcomed back foreign secretary S Jaishankar. In the past few months, Doval and Jaishankar have made trips here to stitch up details of the visit and the agreements.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'politics aside, but we need to friend with everyone who is willing to befriend. whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business. '
'Then plays The Imperial March.'
"With the BJP, yes, they have a natural anti-Muslim connection. Plus India will buy a ton of drones and other surveillance equipment. \n\nAt the same time, India has had long standing ties with Palestine, and a traditional tie with Arab and Iranian oil. For the most part, the latter won out, until now.\n\nEdit: For those downvoting, I'd be curious to know why you disagree with this."
'They were waiting for Indian PM, not Modi.\n\nSome people... SMH'
'For the greater good.'
">Okay, Palestine is one issue over which we are not towards Israel's side for right reasons. Doesn't mean we should not be friendly towards Israel.\n\nWell, this has always been the Indian perspective.\n\n>The citizens are the one who pays taxes and elects the governments, and it is their right that they get the foremost priority by the Indian government\n\nAnd if the citizens want to make a fuss about Israel because of Palestinian issue, then why is that not a priority?\n\nI agree with you mostly, but hopefully you understand why it means we also shouldn't just pretend things are good over there when they are not, just as we don't pretend things are good over here when they are not."
'This is why Modi and Israeli PM love each other, only two people with enough shady history of atrocities to be able to say "What you do with your minorities, none of our business."'
'>whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business.\n\nWrong. I would like my country to stand for principled justice.'
'Yes you can. Israel issues a visa on a separate piece of paper. This means no stamps on your passport.\n\nBest way to do it is to fly directly to Israel or go to Jordan and then through to Israel.\n\nJordan is awesome too - north Jordan feels like a Mediterranean country while the South feels like a Middle Eastern Country.'
'The muslim minority in Israel (not PA) is way better off than all neighbours around there. At least I saw women work and drive around in cars.'
'>Double Standards much?\n\nWhat double standards? What is the official policy of India for Balochastan? How many Balochis have we given asylum to and how many Baloch freedom resolutions have we supported?\n'
"First of all we don't have any official policy on Baluchistan. Yeah our beloved PM mess it up by mentioning it in speech. \rAnd same way we don't like some random nation talking about kashmir"
"So buying oil from Middle East and Iran is affirmation that India agrees to their funding of Terrorism and creating instability in various regions. \n\nWe sell onions to Pakistan and have MFN status so we endorse the terrorism.\n\nWe are super close with Russians so we agree to their annexation of Crimea.\n\nHaving Deals with country doesn't mean that one supports the country's policies. "
'So which nation should we befriend? \n\nIf we befriend Russia, we endorse Putin\'s expansionism in Ukraine and his suppression of democracy at home.\n\nIf we befriend US, we endorse their war on Iraq \n\nIf we befriend China, we endorse their suppression of democracy and their aggression in 1962.\n\nIf we befriend Australia, we endorse the Lost Generations policy.\n\nIf we befriend the gulf countries, we endorse their use of slave labor, their theocracy and support for terrorists.\n\nIf we befriend the UK we endorse their colonialism.\n\nIf we befriend the Germans... No, let\'s not even go there.\n\nSo basically we befriend only those people that have never sinned. That should be easy.\n\nOf course there is no such thing as a friend in diplomacy anyway. There are only interests. We should be as cynical about pursuing our interests as every other nation is. If that means we use the word "friend" insincerely to describe a country we want close relations with, so be it.'
'yes there is a separate platform for that UN, \n\nsimilarly are we comfortable any random nation condemn us on Kashmir issue?'
"Yea if only Hamas and some other shitbags didn't keep violating ceasefires and using schools and hospitals to hide weapons.\n\nIF ONLY"
'there are too many issues within the country which needs principled justice before looking outside. '
"Standing selflessly for principle where everybody else is cynically looking out for their interests is folly. Plus, if we only deal with countries who have never sinned, we'll need to stop having deals with the Arabs, the Russians, the Americans, the Europeans and the Asians as well.\n\nIn fact we've sinned a lot ourselves too, so holding ourselves as some kind of superior moral authority is basically throwing stones while living in a glass house."
'Sounds like a win-win to me.'
"Why are they supposed to be peaceful after being violently driven off of their own land?\n\nAlso, peaceful or not peaceful doesn't excuse human rights violations. If a person commits a crime, put them through the justice system, don't punish the entire minority of your country because of criminals."
"enlighten me _guruji_, I've got my popcorn ready."

And we have a tendency to hero-worship; always believing that one hero will solve all our problems. This is also reflected in the movies, particularly the older ones, where a hero saves a whole village or a nation from corrupt and evil politicians or businessmen.\n\n\nWe need clearly defined right to free speech, which at it's core includes the right to criticize any policy without fear of backlash from the govt or public servants. In this case, the SP should be brought to book and investigated, to get to the root cause of suspension, and if the allegation is true, the SP should be dismissed for wrongful termination and restriction of free speech of a subordinate. \n\nOn a different note, always take such news articles with a grain of salt.

"Godse was a chutiya. \n\nI never saw such posts when Azam Khan was spreading tolerance in UP. Nevertheless, this appointment is shocking and unexpected to you and me but probably reflects the ground realities of UP at the moment. The Hindu vs muslim rhetoric has won several elections in UP, just that it's in BJP's favor this time. Adityanath is the manifestation of the giant Hindu vote consolidation that has happened in response of tactical voting by the muslim community that has swung elections in their favor in many states, including UP. \n\nAdityanath no doubt is a hardliner hindutva proponent and it would be shameful if he indulges in revenge rather than development. It would also be interesting if he refrains from it and gives UP a real chance to develop. In all of Modi's tenure, this must be the greatest litmus test for him as well as the BJP and RSS regarding their ideology and capability. This can forever reinforce their hardline image or help them shatter it. \n\nInstead of peddling a particular image of ground realities, it would be prudent for the media to stop fear mongering and report objectively.

'I think it is more nuanced than you frame it.\n\nThe position of RSS is that Islam and Christianity are foreign religions. More specifically, there is no single Indian character in either the Quran or the Bible. Hence, not every religion in India is on equal footing. Hinduism, due to its organic growth and development in India *is* special and *sui generis*. This is indeed why we favour Tamil in Tamilnadu and not Portugese, for e.g.\n\nYou agree with this, right?\n\nIf all religions were equally good/bad, what explains the creation and continued existence of Pakistan as a separate Islamic theocracy?'

"> Aurangazeb must have done some good in his life even if he did impose jaziya? \n\n*Almost all of the Muslim rulers have imposed Jaziya, there were only few exceptions - Akabar/Dar Shikoh. Aurangazeb isn't considered bad because he was just following the Islamic law of taxation, here is a simple example of the kind of things he did - \n\nHere is Wiki Aurangazeb - He learnt that at Sindh, Multan, Thatta and particularly at Varanasi, the Hindu Brahmins attracted large numbers of indigenous local Muslims to their discourses. He ordered the Subahdars of these provinces to **demolish the schools and the temples of non-Muslims**. Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to **punish Muslims who dressed like non-Muslims**. The **executions** of the antinomian Sufi mystic Sarmad Kashani and the ninth Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur bear testimony to Aurangzeb's religious policy; the former was beheaded on multiple accounts of heresy,[b] the latter, according to Sikhs, because he objected to Aurangzeb's forced conversions. \n\n\n*Though jizya was mandated initially for People of the Book (Judaism, Christianity, Sabianism), it was extended by Islamic jurists to all non-Muslims.[126][127] Thus Muslim rulers in India, with the exception of Akbar, collected jizya from Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs under their rule."

"> The Hindu vs muslim rhetoric has won several elections  \n  \nMuslims constitute 20% of UP's population. Are you saying 20% of people have tactically outvoted 80% of the population repeatedly? Or that only the Muslims vote? If so that is the greatest victory against all odds especially considering they are a minority in just about every constituency in the State.\n  \nThe fact of the matter is that UP elections have often hinged on caste issues. This time the BJP managed to unify the Hindu vote by employing similar rhetoric to those who seek to consolidate the Muslim or Dalit votes. If Muslims were so critical to how elections are decided in UP surely BJP should have suffered for failing to field a single Muslim candidate."

"Sikhism should be a religion favored by the RSS by that measure. You are making up a partial argument that does not stand analysis. That is, the motivations of the RSS cannot be as you described because otherwise by that measure they would be radical Sikhists as well. They are not. The RSS is just another generic religious extremist organization like any Muslim one, and is a stain on India. Sui generis shat on and flushed. Moving on.\n\nTamil is favored in Tamil Nadu because language is of a different nature to religion and is practical/functional. Unlike religious or political identity, it cannot be arbitrarily changed on a whim and it requires exerted effort to adapt to a new language. \n\nThere is no more reason to favor a religious ideology because of its national origins than there is to favor a political ideology because of its national origins. Why is the RSS not radically opposed to constitutional parliamentary democracy? India's inherent political structure is not federal but a bunch of warring antagonistic disunited kingdoms and the occasional empire. \n\nYour argument is not substantive and collapses. There is no particular reason that origin should give weight. India is a secular democratic republic with a structure that is wholly borrowed from abroad. The ideas of the RSS and religious nationalists are anti-Indian by the very definition of modern India. \n\nIf all religions were equally good/bad, what explains the creation and continued existence of India as an impoverished Hindu nationalist state? If this was really a concern of yours, you would be seeking out Christianity, as on average Christian societies are far and away the wealthiest and most successful as of yet."

This is especially dangerous because they all seem to vote for one party only in a given election.\n\nTo win against such party, only a tatic of sizeable hindus voting for them can save their ass.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that even BSP's vote base of dalits voted heavily for BJP. This apparently was due to dalits voting against 100+ muslim nominees of BSP."

Eventually, he merged his party with the Congress. Once Vaghela had been eased out from the BJP, Narendra Modi ceased to be Keshubhai's favourite. Modi had outlived his utility for Patel. Keshubhai wasn't content with merely sidelining Modi, though; he had him transferred to Delhi as organising general secretary of the BJP. This was no ordinary political transfer.

But, what is more surprising that PMO and other few offices of Central government don\'t have Aadhaar card details of Modi\'s Ministers.\n\nModi Government has made linking Aadhaar card mandatory to get benefits of all government services that the 125 crore Indian citizen utilise. But, PMO does not have the information about the Aadhaar card details of its own Ministers working under Modi government. This information has come to light through a reply which was provided to RTI Activist Anil Galgali for his query.\n\nGalgali said, "It is surprising to see that PMO or other few concern departments don\'t have data of Aadhaar card with them of their own ministers. Yes, PM does have an Aadhaar card number but due to security reason details were not given to me."\n\nMoreover, the RTI application filed by Galgali was transferred to 5 different Ministries. The RTO application made rounds to Cabinet Secretariat, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Information and Technology Ministry, and finally reached UIDAI where Galgali got an answer from the Under Secretary, PMO.\n\nThe information regarding the PM\'s Aadhaar number was rejected under Section 8(1) of the RTI Act 2005. Information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information officer or State Public Information officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such Information.\n\n"It shows that they say something but don\'t follow it. I would like to appreciate the efforts of RTI activist who brought this information in light. Common people are not getting benefits of government schemes unless they have Aadhaar card linked to Gas connection, bank etc but here we have ministers who have not shared their Aadhaar numbers it seems. That\'s why PMO or other departments don\'t have information about this." said Shaktisinh Gohil, a Congress leader.\n\nGovernment is advertising with big ads and are asking people to link their Aadhaar cards with their Bank accounts and even their mobile connections along with PAN cards. But, considering the information revealed after the RTI by Galgali, it seems that Modi\'s own ministers have ignored PM Modi\'s instructions. It also seems like rules for common people are slightly a bit different than the ones in power.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

Modi ji giving a bouquet instead of a book to presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind
BJP president Amit Shah’s son, Jay Shah, has seen a dramatic increase in some of his businesses since Narendra Modi became prime minister.
[ShowerThought] If BJP nominated Nathruram Godse for CM's post, BJP supporters would find reason to praise him as well.
Recently read this article about Narendra Modi's rise. Highly recommend it.
I appeal to people to give a book instead of bouquet as a greeting. Such a move can make a big difference: PM Narendra Modi
'I\'m gonna add some sources and data. One important distinction from headline and a TL;DR is:\n\n**- All existing 500 & 1000 rupee notes have to be turned over to the bank brefore December 30^th**\n\n**- New 2000 and 500 rupee notes will be brought into circulation "soon"**\n\nLinks: \n\n* Live stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmwQWe-jA_4\n* News articles: [NDTV](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-nation-tonight-at-8-pm-1622948) | [TheHindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/live-narendra-modis-address-to-nation/article9320548.ece) \n* **New Notes**: [Rs 2000](https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796004344617320448) | [Rs 500](https://twitter.com/ANI_news/status/796004629767036929)\n\nBullet points from Modi\'s speech:\n\n* We need to take a new solid step to fight black money. **From now on, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes will not be used. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices.**\n* **On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.**\n* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.\n* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11. \n* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.\n* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof\n* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value'
"Looks like Janardhan Reddy will have to rework his daughter's wedding arrangements."
"The surprise element is what really amazes me. It's good that Modi retained the surprise as much as possible. Even though the 2000 note was somewhat leaked I don't think anyone would have guessed that 500 and 1000 are being withdrawn. So the fake currency holders and black money hoarders got a huge blow for sure.\n\nHope this exercise bears a lot of fruit. "
'Fuck, this is a brave step. Kudos to the government.'
'This looks like a scene straight out of the Nayak movie..'
"I feel like I'm part of a revolution XD"
"The great thing about this is, no one saw this coming.   \n\nOn CNBC TV18 the way people are reporting, it seems that no one knew that govt will take such a step. Also Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC himself  mentioned 2 times how quietly did RBI manage to pull this! Hope It works.\n\n Edit : Even the Economic affairs secretary didn't see it coming so quietly! "
'This is a great step by Modi.\n\nSome highlights :\n\n* Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000  old notes will be discontinued from midnight. Have 50 days to turn them into banks and post offices. Prior to that last day to turn old notes in RBI offices is 31st March 2017.\n\n* On November 9 and in some places on November 10, ATMs will not work.\n\n* On November 9 banks will be closed for other public works\n\n* Respite for people for the initial 72 hours, government hospitals will accept old Rs. 500 and 1000 notes till 11 November midnight.\n\n* Petrol pumps and retail outlets will have to keep every single entry of cash transaction with 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n\n* Crematoriums and cemeteries will also be allowed to transact 500 and 1000 notes till November 11.\n\n* There will be no change in any other form of currency exchange be it cheque, DD, payment via credit or debit cards etc.\n\n* Those unable to deposit Rs. 1000, Rs. 500 notes by December 30 for some reason, can change them till March 31, 2017 by furnishing ID proof at RBI nodal offices.\n\n* Notes of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 will be circulated soon, RBI has decided to limit the notes with higher value.\n\n* The maximum amount comprising of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes which can be withdrawn in a day is restricted to Rs 2000 per day and Rs 10000 per week, this amount will be increased in coming days. \n\nPlease correct me If I am wrong.'
'Opening bank accounts for subsidies was an important step that enabled this.\n\nMastermind Modi!'

'People need to understand that this is to curb black money and corruption and to promote cashless transactions through cards and various types banking. \n\nIMO this great step but enforcement will be key which in India is a process that  moves at a snails pace.'
"Wow. Everything fits in. This was his plan all along. He kept throwing hints but no one caught it. This might sound like a fanboy thought but it does line up for me:\n\n- Right after getting elected, he announced Jan Dhan Yojna. Yes, bank officials would later on fake numbers by creating dummy account but he gave even the most poor a chance to come under the banking scheme.\n- Earlier this year, govt changed laws requiring jewellers to produce customer's tax documents for any purchase above 2 lacs.\n- He then allows people with black money to come forward. These people have to be the happiest bunch right now. They must be thinking that we took a great deal, even if it meant paying taxes.\n- Then, he does the unthinkable and makes a move very few people would have guts to make.\n- Even my uncles (who buy TV and cars in cash) are going to feel the pinch, and I'm loving it!  :D"

'can anyone please give out an accurate way on how to deal with the fallout of this? What do I do with the 500, 1000 ruppee notes that I have?'
'All 500 notes = deposit in bank and get credited to your bank account, in return there will be a new 500 note. \n\nAll 1000 = deposit in bank and get credited to your bank account, in return there will be a new 2000 note\n\ndaily limit of exchange = 10,000\n\nyou can still put as much money as possible in your bank account like 1 lakh or 1 crore, no limit. \n\n\nall non cash transfers (cheques, cc, debit)  not affected by this. '
"I am a bit ambivalent at this. Isn't this going to affect a lot of the commercial units which deal mainly in cash transactions? \n\nAnd also, how fast would the replacement rate for the new ₹2000 notes will be?\n\nEdit: Ok the Hindu is saying a new series of ₹500, ₹2000 currency notes are going to being issued. ₹1000 notes to be issued no more.

"The dung represents what this govt has done to 60-70 years of progress and development, although slow but in the right direction. \n\nIt's not something that can't be cleaned up, but if the cow is allowed to stay in the ATM booth for too long then it will be get harder to get the shit and stench out."

'Unfortunately for some people, cities just simply grew around their farms. They swallowed whole villages in a blitzkrieg these people have never seen. I\'ve observed this in the numerous villages of delhi. Many were still debating how to deal with the expansion and things completely spiraled outside their homes. They didn\'t have the money to move with the times and the choicesbefore them were pretty tough. It was, either sell your land for some great price and lose your ancestral heritage and move out or live the same life in the middle of the urban chaos along with your cows and mud houses. people chose what suited them and there were pockets of delhi with villages in the middle of swanky offices and the nouveau riche. Slowly but surely, most villages are now selling out though. Places like Hauz khas village have lock stock and barrel rented out and sold property to clubs, cafe\'s, restaurants etc, who have still preserved the old look. It\'s an interesting transition imo. \n\nI\'m not advocating anything in particular though. These are simply my observations over the last 30 years. As we urbanize rapidly these scenes will remain common. Whether the ATM is infringing on the cow\'s space or the cow is infringing upon the ATM\'s, could turn out to be an interesting debate. I mean it in more philosophical way, of course in a literal sense the ATM operator owns the premises.\n\nI really don\'t care about the world "mocking" us either. We have to figure out what will make our urban transition peaceful and organized. For that we have to stop thinking in binary, good and bad, right and wrong. No switch flips in someone\'s head one day which makes him right from wrong. It\'s a slow transition. Think on the scale of generations. '

'"Swaach Bharath" (literally "clean India") is an initiative by the current government of India to create a sense of hygiene among Indians to keep their surroundings clean and free from garbage, and to discourage open defecations and encourage the use of public toilets by the poor. \n\nIt is mocked by Indians because the current PM of India actually just renamed a scheme of the previous government, while cutting funds for it, and indulging in publicity stunts to hide this fact. Naturally, implementation has never matched the hype generated. The cow dung inside the ATM booth highlights this failure.\n\nThe ATM (with an error message) itself is highlighting another failed initiative of our dear leader, DeMonetisation, where every Indian was declared as having untaxed money (black money) and were forced to personally acount for every penny he or she had by depositing all their cash in the bank to exchange it for new notes. The new notes had not been printed before hand, and there was shortage of cash, and a lot of Indians spent a lot of time in long queues in front of the ATM to get some cash in hand, which invariably ran out of cash quickly.\n\nThe cow is highlighting the unofficial beef ban imposed on India by our cow lover Prime Minister, who himself does not have any cow in his house, but wants us all indians to take care of a cow because he (and other religious fundamentalist friends of his) consider them a "holy animal".'

So, Modi is just delivering a lip services or he's trying as a part of a larger strategy to stem big civil societies' backlash and blowing off the steam of a possible big movement against it. \n\n\nNow, we can safely expect nothing substantial will happen on the ground."

In those many decades, this has turned out to be the real power which moves the world.\n\nDemocracy is very hard to control when the media is forced to fight over eyeballs.\n\nThe media industry faces intense competition - so they too resort to the methods that help them win advertizing time and space.\n\nAnyway, theres way too much stuff to be discussed in this.'

"Can't tell if you're trolling or being serious. Bihar was the centre of Buddhism during the Buddha's time on Earth. He lived there. Of course Bihar's symbolism will reflect that.

To billions of people in India and China, who probably don't count as a part of your one-sided 'world', it's sacred, and it will remain that way. Can't believe we now have Indians denouncing their own heritage and symbolism simply because of some event that happened in the 1940's that had (and still has) nothing to do with us. Would you denounce the Om if Kim Jong un appropriated it for NK?\n\n> still it is something vividly hated around the world.\n\nSo? Do you or any of us need approval from the rest of the world?"

'I\'m also a westerner.  Something about your post makes me uncomfortable... like you are seeing the actions of people, but only trying to interpret them through your own experiences and not really thinking about why these things might occur, given different realities of life in india vs. the west.  For the record, I also observe these issues you talk about (of people just doing what\'s needed to complete, only caring about getting paid).  And well understand the frustration it causes, collectively.  But I can understand this behavior why people do it, when I see there\'s some fundamental differences in life between the two places.\n\nI\'ve thought about it a bit recently, and like to share that with you, to give a different way of viewing it.  Maybe I am off base in my conclusions, but at least thoughts to consider.  First, how do we see work in the west?  It\'s my experience at least, that we grow with the main idea form childhood, "be what you want to be, you can be anything when you grow up, take chances and follow your dreams".  I enjoy that idea.  But the reality is there\'s more privilege to do that in the west (for the average person), than there is in India, because of less constraints from family/society, and social protections (if you fuck up and your dreams don\'t pan out, there\'s at least some protections from the government).  When you have spent your life viewing work from that way, it\'s a lot more natural to have \'pride\' in what you do.  In India, a lot of people are directed in to trades from a young high school age, for practical reasons, from family pressures, etc.  Did you know what you wanted to do with your life, when you were 16?  If you\'re shoehorned in to a career, find out later you don\'t like it, but feel little mobility opportunity, can you understand where it would be less likely to care about what you\'re doing?  And though I don\'t like that mindset as much, it makes a lot of sense why this is the mindset, when you think about it.  You are in India... you see the competition that exists, it surrounds you.  Would you want to take the chance to follow your dreams and be a painter if you\'re in Delhi?  Now what if all your family is against the decision, and you have the guilt of thinking it will impact them?  What if you\'re not from a rich family?  What happens if things go wrong and there\'s nothing to fall back on?  What if you\'re thinking of taking care of your parents and need a salary for that?  All I\'m trying to say here is, in the west we have a bit more privilege to look at work as something we aspire towards, and an opportunity to pursue dreams.   It\'s not that you can\'t do that in India, of course you can!  But there\'s inherently greater risk involved, and more perceived risks for those you care of, unless you\'re from a rich and liberal family..  I think India will get there, too.  Give it time.\n\nBeing a laborer in India is a whole different issue in and of itself. Can you put yourself in their shoes for a moment?  Can you imagine living that life?  You\'re doing hard labor, most people in the society look down on you, and you\'re faced with doing this day in day out the rest of your life to keep your family afloat?  The reality is, taking pride in what you do, going the extra step to perfect things has a cost for the person doing it, even if it\'s just additional time, additional thought.  I\'d probably be miserable too if that was my life, and over time, just want to get finished with the job as quick as possible.  I wouldn\'t be looking at it, as this great opportunity I chose, to create things and see that I\'m playing a role in society, I\'d probably be looking at it as, my goal is to keep my family from starving, this is the thing I\'m stuck with for the rest of my life with little room to do much else.  Not to mention most of society then treating me like crap and looking down because it\'s not seen as dignified.  Have you ever worked in a labor field?  I have.  I did take a lot of pride in my work.  But I eventually quit, too, and went a different career path, because it was miserably difficult and there were other options.  I can\'t imagine thinking it was my only option for all my life.\n\nI agree with you, that if you\'re working 10 hours a day doing something you hate and have no pride in, it\'s going to make for a miserable day.  I also agree, that if everyone has a bit more \'pride\', goes the extra mile, whatever, things all around work better.  But I can understand why these things happens, and just feel like a lot of this stems from the differences in how we look at work in our cultures, and those different ways of viewing work make sense given the different environment of both places.'
'Socially, India will take a long long time to come up. There is just too much cultural and societal pressures for many people to truly change. Everyone is worried about what others think.\n\n"What will everyone say if my son becomes a painter instead of an engineer or doctor? Who will marry him?"\n\n"What will our relatives think if they find out my son has schizophrenia/depression/anxiety issues/etc ?"\n\nIn this regard, the western society is far superior. Be whatever you want, do whatever you want, noone cares. If you have a mental disorder, go see a doctor/therapist and get it taken care of. '

"Anyone who thinks the Economist is biased against India hasn't a clue. I've been reading it for around six seven years, and 90% of their articles always have good things to say about Indian democracy, in the past, they've openly rooted for the Indian model of growth against China's. (Check out their covers from before the UPA corruption scandals began to emerge.)\n\nAnd, I would say, they're still pretty soft on Modi, considering the shit fest he's been running for three years now. You should see how they flay Trump, Putin, Erdogan and their own British leaders. "

Not going to help him.\n \nI wonder what foreign readers and Fortune 10 CEOs are going to feel about India when they read this scathing article and see that it is lead by someone like Modi.

Actor Prakash Raj questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the murder of Gauri Lankesh.\n\nA case has been registered against National award-winning actor Prakash Raj in a Lucknow court on a complaint lodged by a lawyer over his recent remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, news agency ANI reported. The case is scheduled to be heard on October 7.\n\nOn Monday, Raj stirred up a storm after questioning the “absolute silence” of PM Modi on those “celebrating” the killing of journalist Gauri Lankesh. The actor, a close friend of the Lankesh family, said the prime minister and others were acting as if nothing had happened despite having social media followers celebrating the killing on social media.\n\n“Who killed my dear friend Gauri is not as important to me today as who has been celebrating her death. There may not be proof as to who killed Gauri but we can see who is celebrating it and from this we can form an idea of who could have killed her. The underlying cruelty in all of this is apparent to many people. Many of those celebrating Gauri’s death are persons followed by the Prime Minister on social media. The PM has been absolutely silent about these people,” Raj said while speaking at the 11th annual convention of left-affiliated students’ group Democratic Youth Federation of India.\n\nALSO READ: BJP hits out at actor Prakash Raj for criticising PM Modi\n\nHe went on to say that: “When we see these people going around acting as if nothing has happened, I feel like giving them the five National Awards I have won for acting.” “Look I am a seasoned actor, can I not see through the acting? Give me some respect. Am I stupid? Are people foolish that they cannot see through all this? Are the youth of today blind? The time has come for Modi to understand this,” Raj continued.\n\nSoon after his speech, reports emerged that Raj wants to give back his national award in protest against the killing of veteran journalist Gauri Lankesh. Rubbishing such reports, the actor clarified saying, “Well I can just laugh at the crawling on the newschannel that Prakash Raj has decided to give back his national awards. I am not such a fool to give back my national awards. It has been given to me for my body of work, which I am very proud of.”\n\nA popular actor in Kannada, Telugu and Tamil film industries, Raj has secured five National Film Awards for his movies.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

I mean what kid wants an FRI registered against them for posting a fucking meme?\n\nNot only that, Because of what happened to Amir, many other stars would be quite. Because of that kid in UP, many people like us are scared to post a fucking meme that even remotely criticizes glorious leader.\n\n\nSo, the message is clear.

"I am just trying to be constructive and write this with only good intent. \n\nIt is ok to criticise the decision makers and persons of public interest. It might even be tolerable to ridicule them in a satire to a certain extent. But ridiculing the followers of something/somebody will only stop the discussion, polarise the society more. I think it is neither wise not acceptable. We saw that in the US election. We see it often in UK election (silent tory). You suppress the opinion of a faction so much, that they are crowded out and you turn your surroundings in an echo chamber. And in the end neither you nor the opposition has ressources/surroundings to have a really constructive approach to discussion and better our opinions. I would like to urge those, who believe in democracy (and not in oligarchy), to please try and remain courteous and engage in meaningful discussion even to people having the opposite opinion than yours. \n\nYes, I also had my moments where I thought of supporter of my opposition being paid writers. Against Bernie Sanders, we even had proofs that there was millions of dollars spent in online trolling/brigading against the Berners. But still the strategy of the Berners was, that sinking to their level dosn't do any good in anycase. If the others are truly paid agents, they are winning by distracting you from the meaningful discussion. If they are honest netizens with their own point of view, you are killing the meaningful discussion.\n\nSo please, if you are really interested in having a sane society and discussion culture, stop with all that cheap insults, trolling etc when discussing something seriously. \n\nI've been called Bhakts, Kulcha-Warrior and what not just for voicing my true and honest opinion. The name calling didnot at all change my point of view. May be others were prevented from taking me seriously, but just as many others were probably also prevented voicing their opinion similar to mine. The instances my opinion changed, was when someone was seriously, honestly and respectably in conversation with me.\n\nAlso, I asked myself a lot and I am also throwing this question in this thread because I could not solve it yet:\nHow do you really find out, who is brainwashed and who is not? How do you distinguish between propaganda and real news? Because people nowadays use thess word against their opposition quite a lot.\n\nI truly hope the society does not polarise the way they seem on reddit. I'm trying to play my part to stop this madness.\n\nTo the subject of this thread: I truly believe, that one can not really grasp any positives or negatives of demonetization so soon. The scheme isn't even over yet. If you really want to cement your opinion based on Modi's monetization policy, you atleast need to wait a year before cementing you opinion. Also there is no hurry because the reelection of PM is not around the corner.\n"

"> First is the limit of only 5000 INR till the end of the year for deposit.

'Genuinely curious. I have seen this "moving out" frequent here. Does it really come in action? Or is it new "oh my god", just to type?'
'There are many ways to move out, but moving out to an English speaking nation is not very easy.\n\nThe easiest English speaking nation to immigrate to is Canada but that too only if you are going the masters route. Even though it\'s the easiest way to immigrate, it still isn\'t very easy and will require spending 4-5 years struggling for it.\n\nEasiest non-English-speaking and still relatively well off country would be Brazil in my opinion. They are actively looking for immigrants for some reason and there are many ways to get in there. I\'m keeping this as the last resort, in case I fail to get into Canada (even though I might not fail because things are looking organized and well planned for me).\n\nYes, it\'s not as good as some of the English speaking countries where people usually immigrate to, but Brazil is miles ahead of India when it comes to average happiness Index. Their official slogan should be "Pop ~~and~~ *a beer and chill". Pretty chilled out nation. Also, I love watching soccer.\n\nAlways have a backup plan for big career decisions(Brazil, in my case) . Am not even marrying until I\'m out of India because you cannot sign a prenup in India and one divorce and my career will get fucked because of fucking alimony. Am gonna be young only for a few years, can\'t fucking risk with getting in a financial mess in those precious 4-5 years that I got.\n\nFor canada there are basically two ways, first is CEC (Canadian Experience Class). It is basically the easiest way. You have to go in as a student, study there for some time and you will be given the same amount of time to find a job as the time it took to get you a degree (i.e you can legally be inside for that period of time). If you get a job then you can apply for Permanent Residence and if you get PR, then it becomes very easy to become a citizen, but getting PR will depend on a lot of factors.\n\nI don\'t remember the name of the second programme to get into Canada (because I\'m not aiming for it), but it is when you already have some skills which the country is actively looking for, then you can apply via this program and based on your profile you will be awarded some points and based on those points they will decide whether you can qualify for that programme or not, if you do qualify, then you have to find a job in Canada, and stay there for I guess two years (not sure about this) before you can apply for PR. Once you get PR, it\'s comparatively easier to become a canadian citizen.\n\nThere is a third way for Canada as well, I guess it is something to do with provincial sponsorship programme. Particular provinces are looking for some specific skills and if you meet them then you can apply via their respective programme. They expect you to stay in that province for a few years after immigration though, which in my opinion is worth it. Anywhere in Canada is better than India to be honest.\n\nNot sure about AUS and ENG, but being commonwealth countries have some advantages, but I don\'t know how easy or difficult is to get in these nations. I cannot provide any information because of particular reasons I am not targeting these countries.\n\nFor USA. Boy, is it a mess? The thing is that US wants to maintain the cultural diversity of the nation, but does not want too many from the same nation to immigrate in the country as that will cause imbalance in the cultural diversity towards one particular ethnicity. Therefore, they limit their entry only to some limited numbers per nation. The problem here now is that the amount of people who apply for their Green cards is huge from India and China because overpopulation, and since US can accept only a few people from one Ethnicity, therefore it becomes very difficult for Indian and Chinese people to immigrate. If you apply now then you would be a part of the ever increasing queue of applicants, so it might be years before you become the citizen of USA, and even after waiting it might get rejected and you might never become a citizen, so USA is really very difficult. Also the different types of Visa mess is actually a thing. You could be stuck in those forever, which is why I ticked USA out of my list.\n\nCanada made the most sense for me to be honest. I\'ve got a great job currently in India which pays me in 7 figures annually (Rupees of course), so I might save some money and do my masters when it\'s time. I\'m pretty young (20) so that helps. Things might be different for you.\n\nDo some research and find out whatever way works the best for you.\n\nEdit : One advice above all. Develop some insane skills, because to be very honest, it makes things much easier. Either have insane skills, or be extremely rich. Think from the perspective of the country taking you in. If you don\'t have either, then you are just another person who will take over country\'s resources, and they have no reason to take you in. The only reason they are taking you in is if you can provide them with valuable skills or invest some money in their country. Yes, you are going there to contribute to their country over yours, and you have to accept that you are being selfish and as some people might call "anti-national". You just have to be aware of these things and be practical about them.\n\n**TLDR : Brazil, Canada easier to immigrate, Don\'t know about AUS and UK; USA immigration is a mess, but worth it if you can do the hard-work required(if you can do the needful, lol (\\^_\\^) )** '

'Kochi metro was well executed under the leadership of DMRC. Both state and Central govt cooperated well on the project. I will say the political credit goes to the former  Kerala CM Omman Chandy . it was his pet project. And 90% of the project was completed under his regime. \n\nCurrent CM Pinarai Vijayan went on to say Modi gave all the support to the project. So Kochi metro is a well executed project irrespective of the political spectrums. We need to be happy that we are getting a world class metro rail but we are focusing on who is taking the credit and who to blame. Typical randia.  '
'I just hope development goes on regardless of who claims to take credit.'
'>It was expected to start by 2006 and complete by 2010. But the project was delayed because the Central Government expressed serious doubts about the economic viability of the project.[11] In 2008 LDF Government under the Chief Minister V. S. Achuthanandan approved the Kochi Metro rail project in a cabinet meeting held on 2nd January 2008 and sent to Central Government for ratification. The Kerala government hoped the Centre would approve a funding structure similar to that used for the Delhi Metro, but they were turned down.[13] The Union Government supported using public–private partnership (PPP) on the build-operate-transfer model.[14] The LDF state government wanted it to be in public sector, which was not accepted to the Central Government. The victory of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the 2011 Kerala legislative assembly elections, changed the scenario in the state[15] and it was decided that the Kochi Metro would follow the Chennai Metro and Delhi Metro models, and would be implemented on a joint venture basis, with investments by the Central and State Government. A Cabinet decision was taken to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. (KMRL) as per orders from Planning Commission and the Union Government for the implementation, operation and maintenance of the metro project. The Public Investment Board (PIB) cleared the project on 22 March 2012 subject to final approval by the Union Cabinet.[17] The Union Government\'s share of the cost would be 20.26%, or ₹1,002.23 crore (US$160 million).[18] On 28 March 2012, at a KMRL board meeting, the decision was taken to entrust the Kochi Metro rail project work to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The number of metro stations on the line was set at 22.[19][20] On 3 July 2012, Union Government gave final clearance to the project. Then Managing Director of KMRL, Tom Jose said, "Now we will sit down with our valued partner, DMRC, and chalk out the way forward, obtaining advice and guidance from former DMRC Chief, E Sreedharan. We aim to complete the project within a span of 3 to 4 years." [21]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Metro\n\nSurely it could\'ve been completed way before in 2010-12 but no one is going to question the previous government about the delay. Public welfare projects being delayed for 5 to 8 years is so normal in India afterall that we are used to it.'

While tolerance of people that look to propagate messages of hate and violence should be corrected, legitimate views on making our country stronger and better must always be welcome, irrespective of which end of the political spectrum it comes from. For a large population of our country, the politics don't matter. For them, it's about helping them increase their standards of life and reaching levels of development they have a right to (whether it's education or employment or even simply, help with their agriculture). Unfortunately the trolls don't get that. Stay strong and let's hope that we're one day able to respect and accommodate differing views and opinions, as a democracy should. "

'Time "Person of the Year" is not an award or honour but is given to whoever has had the biggest effect on the year\'s news. As such, controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938) and Joseph Stalin (1939/42) have appeared on the front cover.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year\n\n>Despite the magazine\'s frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.[4] However, Time magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957) and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts.\n\n\n>Time magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of Time. \n\nI don\'t see how Modi has biggest impact on the year\'s news. His retarded bhakts are seeing this as an award or a honour and voted him. Time\'s person of the year belongs to Trump.  '

Sure, many of the voters may be blind towards his flaws, but in a post Trump world - Time is going to learn to respect the mandate of the people.'
"Trump shocked the world simply by winning despite the kind of campaign he ran and the kind of reactions he got worldwide. That said it doesn't make him 'most influential' yet. I think TIME should wait for him to actually hold office as President before deciding on this."

'Cherry on the top will be Akhilesh throwing shades on Rahul for the loss.'
"Unless they fuckup UP badly in the next 2 years, it seems likely Modi has 2019 locked up.\n\nThis also makes me a bit optimistic that they won't take UP for granted and actually put up a decent cm candidate + actually try to get some investment here, as they have to retain their hold here.\n\nFor the opposition, congress needs to do what it should've done before '14, distance itself from the gandhis, but fat chance of that happening. \n\nAkhilesh despite the loss enjoys decent popularity in UP, but Shivpal and the like will try to pin the loss on him, it'll be interesting to see where that goes. \n\n"

"Regarding demonitization, I feel that people were more affected by the fact that a government can take such a strong step than the step itself and that is what is helping BJP and Modi now. \n\nBesides, his PR has been really good. AAP may have done some good things in Delhi but Kejriwal kept on making a fool of himself by his continuous bitching about Modi, which, frankly, became cringeworthy (looking at *What's the deal Modiji?* ). \n\nThen admit it or not, Modi has been successful in his foreign policies, the world is noticing India and our relevance has certainly increased. If they do not fuck up this strong mandate and keep working towards better taxation, stronger growth and manufacturing, lowering corruption and more transparency then 2019 is totally in BJP's pocket without doubt.\n\nAnd yeah, fuck Congress. They're ded."

'I hope they try to break up the state into 2-3 pieces so that it can be governed better '
'Remember 2004 . BJP and Modi did not stopped working hard till  last day of election . There is a reason Modi spent 3 days in Varanasi . Do not assume that you will win . If BJP and RSS workers continue working hard then definitely BJP will win in 2019 . '
"Don't ask if Modi will win in 2019 or not; ask who is the worthy one who can oppose him?"
"Opposition in India is a joke. But I respect democracy, so it seems 2019 is locked as even if bjp fucks up again, it won't matter."
'I am more surprised about Punjab results'
'There is still no trace of any competition from other parties. He might win with even bigger mandate. '
'As i said 2 weeks ago, we won in 2014 and we again win in 2019. \n\nCongratulations to all BJP party members and Other Indians.'
'Very very good signs for Modi. The key to retaining majority for Modi is UP as it would be difficult to recover too many seats from a fall of seats in UP (from 73). But, this shows that the popularity of Modi in UP is quite high and the fall at this stage will be quite small.'
'Unlike the steak socialists of randia ( calling them so because of their obsession of showing how edgy they are by eating beef) most people were not affected by demonetization beyond a month. And the people who are used to queuing in front of ration shops and have an average wealth of 5000 rupees were not negatively impacted. \nIn Modi people see a person who is trying to do something. His equivalents are PIS in Poland and the Conservatives under Theresa May. just like r/uk and r/europe tend to be in meltdown as to why brexit happened and it is britain committing suicide demonetization will not hurt that much in reality just like with brexit the sky has not fallen down.'
'> After demonetisation, many felt that Narendra Modi would have a tough time in Uttar Pradesh.\n\n LOL wut? '
'BJP has not broached the topic so far but I hope with this mandate, they actually split the state into four by 2019 or at least the next state election. UP needs to be split for the sake of the country'
'Well, we can safely say 2019 is going to be a non-contest, Modi is returning to power. Rahul Gandhi needs to realise the only good he can do is set up internal elections in Congress, dismantle the high command and let regional leaders lead local party activities - case in hand, Punjab.'
'Certainly hope so.'
'yes, and no.\n\nYes it is locked up. \n\nNo, he would have locked it in without UP.\n\nModi and his team get modern politics better than their opposition. They would win 2019 anyway.'
'People of UP are convinced about the Muslim favouritism....so they voted for a party that dint have even one Muslim leader \nThe most popular watsapp forward in UP is of Muslim becoming majority by 2050.\nEdit:\nAlso.....Hard work is better than Harvard'
'I think this is the best outcome India,as a country, could have asked for. \n\nBjp wins two states in a decisive fashion - giving them impetus to do better by 2019 and Congress wins 3 states, keeping them relevant.  \n\nA democracy without effective opposition cannot function. '
"I really believe it now.Demo was the make or break thing and the nation has wholeheartedly embraced it.\n\nIts not about whether the decision was successful or not but govt exercising such obscene power over a country , it maybe within constitution but felt supremely dictatorial.\n\nAnd the way they were so  frivolous with people's money ,it will never sit right with me.Went back on their own word, altered rules every second day, it was one hell of shitshow.\n\nBut clearly the faith in Modi is so intense all this was overlooked.    "
'Hard to say. Indian elections are inherently unpredictable and a lot can change in 2 years. For example in 2014 even with the euphoria over the historic Lok Sabha verdict even most BJP supporters did not expect that Amit Shah would be able to sustain such a performance till the UP assembly elections in 2017.'
'Hello, as an American I came across this headline:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/03/11/asia/uttar-pradesh-elections/index.html\n\nThe headline was "Why these Indian state elections matter to the whole world", but the article does nothing to describe the WHY part. Can anyone maybe give some insight into why Modi winning would affect the rest of the world, or why other countries should have any thoughts on this election?\n\nI\'m just really curious what the political situation in India is like! Is Modi a right wing guy, a left wing guy, are people generally happy with him, do people hate him, or is it about even?\n\nWhat are his proponents saying about him, and what are him opponents also saying? \n\nThanks for any feedback!'

"If there's one party I feel sorry for, it's the BSP. Despite Mayawati's faults, she did not deserve a result as poor as this one. Her governance was far superior to the SP. "
"Looks right now. We don't have any solid opposition leader. If AAP had won in Punjab, at least Kejri could keep Modi somewhat in check. No other leader in my sight right now. "
"I think it's been a great day for Congress. The rumours of their death have been greatly exaggerated - They seem to be taking Punjab. In Manipur & Goa, never thought they would do well. Great show!"
'Now that BJP has its Rajya Sabha majority, can we please get the promised golden age of India?'
"I'm happy with Congress performance. Nobody expected them to win UP. But they regained Punjab, Goa and held Manipur. Overall quite good."
"This result might deflate Akhilesh's rising star. Hopefully it'll lead to a split of the party so that SP can never come back again.\n\nWhat UP and the nation needs is a better second option to BJP."
"I am curious about whether they are going to try to do anything about that now. They're in power at both state and centre, all that's left is to resolve the Babri court case."

Ambedkar quoted John Stuart Mill, who cautioned citizens not ‘to lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or to trust him with powers which enable him to subvert their institutions’. This warning was even more pertinent here than in England, for in India, Bhakti or what may be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part it plays in the politics of any other country in the world. Bhakti in religion may be the road to the salvation of a soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship.'

"Yeah but Britain is one country as big as a medium sized Indian state, with a largely homogeneous culture throughout.

"Electing Modi to power doesnt equal to Hating Pakistanis or Muslims....\n\nI'm sure than more than 50% of those who voted for Modi didnt vote for bringing a Ram rajya and taking revenge on Muslims for what the Mughals and Ghazni etc did to them....\n\nThey voted because of the scams done by congress and no good alternative...If Modi doesnt perform,he will be thrown and someone else will be elected... \n\nI'm in US and when I was in NY,one of my favorite eating joint was a pakistani restaurant....They were very friendly and they used to put a little extra when I ordered ..... \n\nAlso I've seen that many pakistanis are very cagey when they approach Indians because they are afraid of us ..."
'Was in a NY restaurant few months back, my colleague was confused and taking too long to decide what to order, when the manager of the place who happened to be from Pakistan overhead us so he came over and just said let me get food for you that I think you will like. That was one of the best meals we had in a long time. The way he spoke to us with such warmth, addressing us as "Bhaijaan". To be honest, I come across many Indians at several places but just don\'t feel the same. '
'I meet and chat with a Pakistani from "azaad kashmir" every time I go offsite. He was kind of weird at first, but he\'s super nice and has helped me many times. '
"Indians and Pakistanis seek each other our and become friends. Even turn into each others support system. I have seen it in France, UK, US, UAE and Australia.  \n\nBasically because Goras and Arabs don't care a shit about either. So they just have each other.    "
'I really had awesome butter chicken and nan at this restaurant in Bangkok. It was run by Pakistani brothers and he gave us priority service ignoring all the white people who came before us.  Unlike India, where whites are treated like Gods. We chatted a bit and discussed about lives at both side of the borders. It was really an eye opening experience.'
"Off topic but I had to post.\n\nThis is my experience as a Punjabi who has travelled a bit: \n\n- Pakistanis: have a special affinity towards Punjabi Indians. My brother who looks Persian by all accounts always attracts Pakistanis and Iranians from far and wide who think - oh ye to apna banda hai. Like I have seen them break supermarket queues to come say Hi to him. It doesn't matter when they later find out he's a Hindu. Any Pakistani bus or taxi driver is open and friendly. Two Pakistani guys showed interest in me which all came to abrupt end once the words 'magar hamare Islam mein...' and 'haan magar Aamir Khan to Muslim hi hai na' were uttered.\n\n- Afghanis and Iranians: love Indians! General topic of discussion that unites us is our contempt for Pakistanis, and 'love' of Hindi movies. The Afghani driver didn't fail to point out though that, oh but Hindus have so many gods..\n\n- Sri Lankans: Sinhalese don't mix with Tamilians even with SL Tamilians and, have a special hatred for India obviously. Melbourne is apparently the capital of SL expats and the Sinhalese that I know are really sweet people except that they really really *really* dont like India. After lots of observations my conclusion is that - India is the big brother. These guys think that India is a bully - kinda weird feeling when you realise that India is seen as powerful by some people. Who'd a thunk it? I will never support SL in any match, except against Australia.\n\n- Bangladeshis: These guys are Bongs before anything else. I have seen that Hindu Bengalis and Muslim Bangladeshis are really really, fiercely,  proud of their Bangla culture and are frequently socialising with each other. On a number of occasions one of these Bangladeshi aunties have told me, why would you want to leave India? It is so beautiful? After talking to her I fully believe that part of her family is now living illegally in India. Her relatives were in the army fighting for the Pakistani side in '71, so she has special reason to NOT be in India. \n\nConclusion: The Indian subcontinent is real. Kids of India, but especially north India, who have grown up being exposed to all Indians - Punjabis, Gujratis, Sindhis, Bengalis, Tamilians etc - the people, the language, the culture, the food - We will be able to find something in common with everyone from the subcontinent. All the more reason to preserve and celebrate all our languages and cultures and while realising how incredibly strong we are in unity. The other countries in the subcontinent are too homogenous, and are intimidating by differences. \n\n(Sorry I just saw Dangal - sniff - so emotional. Jai Hind, Jai Maharashtra.)"
"I've met a lot of nice Pakistanis just like I've met a lot of nice Brits, Americans, Aussies, Bangladeshis etc but I've never had the smug satisfaction of making a preachy self post about it... probably because I judge people independent of their heritage"
"Off-course! We're basically the same. I grew up in the Middle East then went to US for uni. I had bunch of Pakistani friends since I was a kid. We spoke in Punjabi. Our languages are almost identical other than the dialects across Punjab. We share the same culture. \n\nI remember back in college, my Pakistani buddies and I would get shitfaced on the weekend and listen to Urdu and Punjabi poetry, Nusrat Sahab, Hans Raj Hans, Gurdas Maan, Junoon etc. This is the cultural bond we have! Specially the regions of Delhi, Punjab and UP have waay too much common with the Pakistani population!\n\n Aint no border can separate this for long. Peace is inevitable. "
'1 like = 1 respect '
'Individuals are mostly good unless they are ideologically fanatic. But when they become part of the mob problem starts. Reason people become part of mob is because they have accepted some part of ideology as theirs without putting much thoughts.\n\nYes, we are all the same people but when ideology called religion, nationalism, politics enters the terrain it becomes difficult subject.\n\nYou can say 5% are active ideologues, 5% are active opponents and rest are dormant. They are busy making their living but are silent supporters. \n'
'I had a Pakistani friend when I was in the US. According to a lot of people we looked extremely similar (my friends used to say he was a better looking version of me). He was not 21 then which is the legal drinking age in the US so he used to take my passport when he wanted to go to bars. Never got caught once!'

"A lot of ppl will brand me a bhakt or a psychopath for saying this but I'll say it anyway.\n\nThe idea of Akhand Bharat has merit. Hinduism and Vedic philosophy are the perfect catalyst to offset the more crazier aspects of abrahamic religions and create a uniform philosophy working beyond boundaries of religion and social structures which can appeal to all as a singular philosophy.\n\nWe already see some variants of this core philosophy or attempts to achieve it from the creation of Sufism, Sikhism and Din-i-alahi along with the works of ppl like Darah Shikoh, Ghalib, Sai baba etc.\n\nThere is a reason the powers that be sought to egg on Partition, simply because they wanted us to be separated and constantly fighting over artificial borders. This is isnt just about geopolitics and power of nation states but about control over the human psyche and philosophy itself. \n\nThe Indian Subcontinent and Indochina states are unique in the sense that they somehow manage to find a balance between Vedic, Buddhist, Confucian and Abhramanic religions. I cant explain exactly how but its there, its happening and its been happening for a long time.\n\nThe day we remove these artificial borders and unite the whole region from Iran to Indonesia into one cohesive unit, it will act as an example to show that it is in fact possible to get over the boundaries of race, caste (social structure) and religion for good."
'A lot of people are dissing the OP for callling Pakistanis as the same as us. Some even said we need to judge Pakistan on its action as a state. Which is fair. \nWhat I think we need to understand from this is that a considerable population of Pakistan is sane, progressive and liberal. Not blindly paint them all as some Hateful, sharia loving mullahs. \nWe need to engage more with these people so that one day they come to power and represent the Pakistan state. From army generals in pak army to politicians. Only then can we get peace. '
'>One of my best friends in Germany is a pakistani refugee.\n\nTop kek. The memes write themselves. 😂🚛'
'Once I met a Pakistani Uncle in Vienna. That day I learnt that they (pakis) are so fond of us. But we\'re reserved and feel like taboo talking to them. He wasn\'t a "progressive" muslim going by his appearance but certainly more open minded than us. He told me about his birthplace in India (Ambala) and talked on various personal topics from Khushwant singh to Engineering to Mudiji. Yes, pakis are disgusted with Mudi. We\'re all same.'
"Except that we're not the same people. We were at some point but we're not anymore. Each society is held together by myths (not in a religion term but more in a societal term) and markers that form the underpinnings of their culture. For example, partition is the foundational myth of India and Pakistan but they're both two fundamentally different myths of the same event. Sure we have markers and myths that overlap, such as good etc, but the ones that seem to really bins the two societies in their own countries together are fundamentally different. \n\nSo for me, a good rule of thumb is to be happy we share a great many markers and be happy that I found people (form anywhere really) who show me kindness and respect. And i tend to judge them on an individual basis because people tend to behave and adapt based on their surroundings too. Give each person the benefit of being an individual is pretty much my mantra.

I am not defending the Government on that point and agree with the criticism.  \n\nHowever, keeping the politics aside, there are couple of other interesting points. India actually added about 4GW in 2016 (calendar year). The 3GW number I put was extrapolation of the nine month FY data. Secondly, it is expected we will add about 9GW in 2017 calendar year. That seems to be close to your number and realistic too. China added 15GW in 2016 and US about 9GW, so the 9GW number for 2017 is awesome. [Source](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/india-likely-to-add-more-than-9-gw-solar-capacity-in-2017-mercom/article9456806.ece)'
"What India needs is different than what we can realistically achieve with the limited resources. It doesn't hurt to aim high and push people. If he would have aimed 5 GW this year, we would have achieved maybe 1 GW."
"> as the government spin machine would like you to believe\n\nCan you point out where is this government spin machine? On the contrary I've only seen articles criticising the policies by cherry picking the data. \n\n> We aren't doing bad, but we are not doing great either\n\nTrue, but we are doing [much better than before](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5n40vq/modi_govt_achieves_only_19_of_12000mw_solar_power/dc8kumg/). A better article would have been why didn't we meet the goals this year and if the government is doing anything about it."
"Wind turbine locations are dictated by the wind velocity and related factors. Don't know about Germany, but here in  India we are running out of even decent locations for wind turbines. Most good sites are taken. So expecting wind turbines everywhere isn't right. \n\nGoing forward better equipment might be put up at mediocre locations or older turbines at existing locations will be replaced. "
"> modi has not been working with his core competency\n\nSee, the problem is that he *has*. What is his core competency? Rousing the masses, promising the moon and demonising the opposition as a bunch of corrupt devils. \n\nModi has a god-given talent for being a demagogue. That's why he got elected in the first place, it's why he shrugged off the disastrous economic effects of DeMo in the rural hinterland, it is why he will win the UP elections and why I expect him to win the 2019 re-election.\n\nModi's core competency is propaganda, and there is nobody even close to him in that department. Possibly the most talented politician India has ever had in terms of raw political skill and messaging.\n\nAnyone interested in mass propaganda, PR or even marketing should study the Nov 8th to Dec 30th period. You are witnessing a master in action of the public discourse.\n\nThat is has no relation to actual economic performance/competence is merely a footnote."
'Keep in mind that generation is not the same thing as installations. Some years are sunnier than others, and as such, you can have more electricity generation than would otherwise be the norm if a year has more sunny hours.\n\nWhat matters is the capacity installed. From your own link:\n\n[Installed capacity at less than 1965 MW](https://i.sli.mg/9p17Jh.png). That data goes back to the last of October of 2016. Livemint probably uses more updated number, which is why they have a higher number in their story.\n\n\nP.S. the press bureau has a terrible website. You can\'t even link individual news items. For everyone who wonders about my source, go to [this](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=28) then select 1st of december to the left, the one with "solar" in its title.\n\n'
"> By coupling together the last two years, you are being misleading\n\nI will leave it to the people to think if it's misleading or not - what is misleading is the linked article which doesn't give overall context or improvements over the year. \n\n> Modi's government is on track to do worse on their stated goals in 2016-17 than they were last year\n\nYou are right on this. There is no doubt performance has declined in 2016 compared to 2015\n\n> In other words, their execution performance is declining. This is even more bizarre given that the costs of solar is falling year over year and that India has received more FDI\n\nI agree with you on the first part. However for the second part you are assuming money was the bottleneck. I don't know enough to tell if it's correct or not. One possible very important factor is the [WTO ruling against India](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/dPX7vDr1SaGmzoT2X1wDPI/Indias-appeal-against-WTO-solar-ruling-rejected.html). This is what I would have assumed the media to have done - find out *why* did the performance decrease. It might also turn out that the projects stated to complete in Q4 2016 got delayed till Q1 2017. Again - not enough data to tell if they are really slipping *in the long run*\n\n> capacity additions should do better as a percentage of the target in the current \n\nNot if the targets were ambitious. 2015 was first full year and targets were 2000MW. 2016 was second full year and targets were 12000MW - 6x increase! So it is not necessary that percentages should increase, 2016 was clearly a stretch goal. "
'data does matter, what i am saying is , IF it were congress right now, it wouldn\'t be doing any better.\n\nas for modi\'s decision, i think you can see "crashing the economy" was in Hindsight better than not crashing, and letting it crash under its own weight.\n\nP.S. i am far from modi bakt, but he gives more hope than anyone else right now.'
">  Solar and Wind are close to grid parity \n\nHow is this achieved only in India? No other report outside of India says it's anywhere close. What's so special about Indian solar?    \n\nMy feeling is that, it's achieved parity for the vendors because of subsidies. I don't think in reality it's close to parity for the country."
'He should have then aimed for 50 GW, then may be we would have reached 10 GW. Lost opportunity. '
'>Energy minister Piyush Goyal is sure that the 175gw target will be met. "India is moving rapidly towards realising the clean energy vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Goyal said earlier this year on the micro-blogging site Twitter. Bolstered by the progress, in May, Goyal said that he was considering an upward revision for 2022 solar target.\xa0\n\n\n\nFrom [here](http://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-renewable-energy-targets-catch-the-attention-of-global-investors-still-need-ground-work/articleshow/53015707.cms). A casual google search, or even the constant barrage on twitter, will make anyone believe India is on track to become the next renewable energy powerhouse. I do understand the fact that Modi is, at the very least, *trying.* However, take any news like these with a pinch of salt. '
'I want to talk about ubiquity of wind mills and solar panel. India is roughly nine times bigger in terms of area than Germany. They produce sometime more than they consume and give it for free to their consumers. '
"> Anyone interested in mass propaganda, PR or even marketing should study the Nov 8th to Dec 30th period. You are witnessing a master in action of the public discourse.\n\nnot really. demo sailed through without major harm to BJP or Modi because the image of Modi that was carefully constructed over the years - essentially a bachelor, no children, hard working, incorruptible, hindutvawadi, jingositic, decisive, etc. which appeals to his base. that is what has floated BJP's boat so far through demo."
"Hey,\n\nFirst of all, thanks. Its very refreshing to have a discussion with actual data. Secondly, yes the installed capacity is not the same as generation. However, all the targets I could find on MNRE deal with generation and not capacity.\n\nFinally, livemint might have newer data but official numbers of the 1965 MW installation is for a duration of 6 months (and not the entire year). I don't expect this to see a significant jump, though if the trend follows, this should still be higher than 2015-16."
"> we get that\n\nWe? Who are we? Are you taking your medications, bro? Those voices inside your head is just you.\n\n> We totally understand\n\nAwkard.\n\n> Who cares if he gave a 100 GW target or not\n\nYeah, who gives a shit about accountability. Solid argument man. As I pointed out earlier; to bhakts... data, facts and accountability doesn't matter.\n\nGoalshifting, or in your case getting rid of the goal altogether, is forgivable as long as Modi is excused and protected. Such people are not deserving to be taken seriously. "
"Yes it's not the real gird parity in the strict sense in India. Although it's happening in many markets.\n\nhttps://www.db.com/cr/en/concrete-deutsche-bank-report-solar-grid-parity-in-a-low-oil-price-era.htm\n\nIn India, tax subsidies do play a part. Especially the accelerated depreciation which has made wind and solar cheaper. However we have got subsidies on coal as well for many of the power plants who were given mines cheaper or have a preferred links with Coal India. It's difficult to compare like on like. "

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**We’ve waited 70 yrs for you, Israeli PM tells Modi as he lands in Tel Aviv** \n\n ______ \nTEL AVIV: "We have waited for 70 years for you," Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu greeted PM Narendra Modi soon after his aircraft touched down to an effusive welcome that saw Modi reciprocating the warmth, saying his visit marked a "path breaking journey of engagement".As Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Israel, a late afternoon sun beat down on the red carpet at a secluded corner of Ben Gurion airport. As Air India One taxied up, Netanyahu was waiting at the bottom of the steps and Modi, dressed in a cream bandhgala, lightly ran down and both men enveloped each other in a bear hug."Aapka swagat hai mere dost," Netanyahu said as the leaders hit the right notes. Modi returned a "shalom" and said in Hebrew that he was delighted to be in Israel.Netanyahu said, "We love India. We admire your culture, history, democracy and commitment to progress. I am confident of the real mathematics of life, of success of our partnership for many reasons, talent of our people."Modi touched upon a personal memory of Netanyahu\'s — Tuesday was the 41st anniversary of the Entebbe raid to save 94 Israeli hostages held in Uganda — an operation that claimed the life of the Israeli leader\'s elder brother. "Your heroes are an inspiration for the younger generations," Modi said.The PM was greeted by leaders of all major religions here — Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jew, Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Catholic and Muslim — a ritual that is only reserved for the Pope or the US president. Netanyahu led Modi through introductions with his cabinet and senior officials.When Modi introduced his delegation beginning with NSA Ajit Doval, Netanyahu said he was glad the visit had come to fruition. "You had something to do with it," he told Doval.In his welcome remarks, Netanyahu reminded Modi that he had said "the sky is the limit for India and Israel". "We are working together in space programmes, so we can now say the sky is not the limit anymore," he said. Acknowledging Modi\'s love for acronyms, Bibi delivered one of his own, "I-square-plus-T-square — India and Israel plus Israeli technology and Indian talent, is India-Israel ties for tomorrow."Modi\'s tried his hand at Hebrew with a "Shalom le kulaam ani semya mayodh lehiyot po (I am delighted to be here)." The PM\'s appreciation of Israel clearly came through. "The people of Israel have built a nation on democratic principles. They have nurtured it with hard work, grit and the spirit of innovation. You have marched on regardless of adversity and converted challenges into opportunity. India applauds your achievements," he said."In our path of sustained high growth and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners. The need to rely on science, technology, innovation, and higher technical education to overcome our developmental challenges is common to both of us," Modi added.Both leaders clearly bonded at a personal level, which came through at the airport ceremony. Over the next couple of days, the two men will spend virtually all their waking moments together.Later, Modi visited a flower farm, where he was given a chrysanthemum named after him. The business end of the visit had begun with a briefing on cutting edge agricultural technologies. A little later, Modi paid a symbolically significant visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, which has a hall with the name of 4.6 million victims of Nazi terror.Michael Oren, former Israeli envoy to the US and a senior minister in Netanyahu\'s office, told TOI, "India and Israel share democratic values and our partnership is important for development. Also, as the US begins to turn away, its important for us to look out for each other."In his interaction, Netanyahu welcomed back foreign secretary S Jaishankar. In the past few months, Doval and Jaishankar have made trips here to stitch up details of the visit and the agreements.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'politics aside, but we need to friend with everyone who is willing to befriend. whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business. '
'Then plays The Imperial March.'
"With the BJP, yes, they have a natural anti-Muslim connection. Plus India will buy a ton of drones and other surveillance equipment. \n\nAt the same time, India has had long standing ties with Palestine, and a traditional tie with Arab and Iranian oil. For the most part, the latter won out, until now.\n\nEdit: For those downvoting, I'd be curious to know why you disagree with this."
'They were waiting for Indian PM, not Modi.\n\nSome people... SMH'
'For the greater good.'
">Okay, Palestine is one issue over which we are not towards Israel's side for right reasons. Doesn't mean we should not be friendly towards Israel.\n\nWell, this has always been the Indian perspective.\n\n>The citizens are the one who pays taxes and elects the governments, and it is their right that they get the foremost priority by the Indian government\n\nAnd if the citizens want to make a fuss about Israel because of Palestinian issue, then why is that not a priority?\n\nI agree with you mostly, but hopefully you understand why it means we also shouldn't just pretend things are good over there when they are not, just as we don't pretend things are good over here when they are not."
'This is why Modi and Israeli PM love each other, only two people with enough shady history of atrocities to be able to say "What you do with your minorities, none of our business."'
'>whatever they do with Palestine is none of our business.\n\nWrong. I would like my country to stand for principled justice.'
'Yes you can. Israel issues a visa on a separate piece of paper. This means no stamps on your passport.\n\nBest way to do it is to fly directly to Israel or go to Jordan and then through to Israel.\n\nJordan is awesome too - north Jordan feels like a Mediterranean country while the South feels like a Middle Eastern Country.'
'The muslim minority in Israel (not PA) is way better off than all neighbours around there. At least I saw women work and drive around in cars.'
'>Double Standards much?\n\nWhat double standards? What is the official policy of India for Balochastan? How many Balochis have we given asylum to and how many Baloch freedom resolutions have we supported?\n'
"First of all we don't have any official policy on Baluchistan. Yeah our beloved PM mess it up by mentioning it in speech. \rAnd same way we don't like some random nation talking about kashmir"
"So buying oil from Middle East and Iran is affirmation that India agrees to their funding of Terrorism and creating instability in various regions. \n\nWe sell onions to Pakistan and have MFN status so we endorse the terrorism.\n\nWe are super close with Russians so we agree to their annexation of Crimea.\n\nHaving Deals with country doesn't mean that one supports the country's policies. "
'So which nation should we befriend? \n\nIf we befriend Russia, we endorse Putin\'s expansionism in Ukraine and his suppression of democracy at home.\n\nIf we befriend US, we endorse their war on Iraq \n\nIf we befriend China, we endorse their suppression of democracy and their aggression in 1962.\n\nIf we befriend Australia, we endorse the Lost Generations policy.\n\nIf we befriend the gulf countries, we endorse their use of slave labor, their theocracy and support for terrorists.\n\nIf we befriend the UK we endorse their colonialism.\n\nIf we befriend the Germans... No, let\'s not even go there.\n\nSo basically we befriend only those people that have never sinned. That should be easy.\n\nOf course there is no such thing as a friend in diplomacy anyway. There are only interests. We should be as cynical about pursuing our interests as every other nation is. If that means we use the word "friend" insincerely to describe a country we want close relations with, so be it.'
'yes there is a separate platform for that UN, \n\nsimilarly are we comfortable any random nation condemn us on Kashmir issue?'
"Yea if only Hamas and some other shitbags didn't keep violating ceasefires and using schools and hospitals to hide weapons.\n\nIF ONLY"
'there are too many issues within the country which needs principled justice before looking outside. '
"Standing selflessly for principle where everybody else is cynically looking out for their interests is folly. Plus, if we only deal with countries who have never sinned, we'll need to stop having deals with the Arabs, the Russians, the Americans, the Europeans and the Asians as well.\n\nIn fact we've sinned a lot ourselves too, so holding ourselves as some kind of superior moral authority is basically throwing stones while living in a glass house."
'Sounds like a win-win to me.'
"Why are they supposed to be peaceful after being violently driven off of their own land?\n\nAlso, peaceful or not peaceful doesn't excuse human rights violations. If a person commits a crime, put them through the justice system, don't punish the entire minority of your country because of criminals."
"enlighten me _guruji_, I've got my popcorn ready."

And we have a tendency to hero-worship; always believing that one hero will solve all our problems. This is also reflected in the movies, particularly the older ones, where a hero saves a whole village or a nation from corrupt and evil politicians or businessmen.\n\n\nWe need clearly defined right to free speech, which at it's core includes the right to criticize any policy without fear of backlash from the govt or public servants. In this case, the SP should be brought to book and investigated, to get to the root cause of suspension, and if the allegation is true, the SP should be dismissed for wrongful termination and restriction of free speech of a subordinate. \n\nOn a different note, always take such news articles with a grain of salt.

"Godse was a chutiya. \n\nI never saw such posts when Azam Khan was spreading tolerance in UP.

Adityanath is the manifestation of the giant Hindu vote consolidation that has happened in response of tactical voting by the muslim community that has swung elections in their favor in many states, including UP. \n\nAdityanath no doubt is a hardliner hindutva proponent and it would be shameful if he indulges in revenge rather than development. It would also be interesting if he refrains from it and gives UP a real chance to develop. In all of Modi's tenure, this must be the greatest litmus test for him as well as the BJP and RSS regarding their ideology and capability. This can forever reinforce their hardline image or help them shatter it. \n\nInstead of peddling a particular image of ground realities, it would be prudent for the media to stop fear mongering and report objectively.

More specifically, there is no single Indian character in either the Quran or the Bible. Hence, not every religion in India is on equal footing. Hinduism, due to its organic growth and development in India *is* special and *sui generis*. This is indeed why we favour Tamil in Tamilnadu and not Portugese, for e.g.\n\nYou agree with this, right?\n\nIf all religions were equally good/bad, what explains the creation and continued existence of Pakistan as a separate Islamic theocracy?'

"> Aurangazeb must have done some good in his life even if he did impose jaziya? \n\n*Almost all of the Muslim rulers have imposed Jaziya, there were only few exceptions - Akabar/Dar Shikoh. Aurangazeb isn't considered bad because he was just following the Islamic law of taxation, here is a simple example of the kind of things he did - \n\nHere is Wiki Aurangazeb - He learnt that at Sindh, Multan, Thatta and particularly at Varanasi, the Hindu Brahmins attracted large numbers of indigenous local Muslims to their discourses. He ordered the Subahdars of these provinces to **demolish the schools and the temples of non-Muslims**. Aurangzeb also ordered Subahdars to **punish Muslims who dressed like non-Muslims**. The **executions** of the antinomian Sufi mystic Sarmad Kashani and the ninth Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur bear testimony to Aurangzeb's religious policy; the former was beheaded on multiple accounts of heresy,[b] the latter, according to Sikhs, because he objected to Aurangzeb's forced conversions. \n\n\n*Though jizya was mandated initially for People of the Book (Judaism, Christianity, Sabianism), it was extended by Islamic jurists to all non-Muslims.[126][127] Thus Muslim rulers in India, with the exception of Akbar, collected jizya from Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs under their rule."

Or that only the Muslims vote? If so that is the greatest victory against all odds especially considering they are a minority in just about every constituency in the State.\n  \nThe fact of the matter is that UP elections have often hinged on caste issues. This time the BJP managed to unify the Hindu vote by employing similar rhetoric to those who seek to consolidate the Muslim or Dalit votes. If Muslims were so critical to how elections are decided in UP surely BJP should have suffered for failing to field a single Muslim candidate."

The RSS is just another generic religious extremist organization like any Muslim one, and is a stain on India. Sui generis shat on and flushed. Moving on.\n\nTamil is favored in Tamil Nadu because language is of a different nature to religion and is practical/functional. Unlike religious or political identity, it cannot be arbitrarily changed on a whim and it requires exerted effort to adapt to a new language. \n\nThere is no more reason to favor a religious ideology because of its national origins than there is to favor a political ideology because of its national origins. Why is the RSS not radically opposed to constitutional parliamentary democracy? India's inherent political structure is not federal but a bunch of warring antagonistic disunited kingdoms and the occasional empire. \n\nYour argument is not substantive and collapses. There is no particular reason that origin should give weight. India is a secular democratic republic with a structure that is wholly borrowed from abroad. The ideas of the RSS and religious nationalists are anti-Indian by the very definition of modern India. \n\nIf all religions were equally good/bad, what explains the creation and continued existence of India as an impoverished Hindu nationalist state?

This is especially dangerous because they all seem to vote for one party only in a given election.\n\nTo win against such party, only a tatic of sizeable hindus voting for them can save their ass.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that even BSP's vote base of dalits voted heavily for BJP.

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Aadhaar card mandatory for commoners but not for ministers under Modi government** \n\n ______ \nIf you fail to link your Aadhaar card with your mobile operator or with your Bank you may not get uninterrupted service till the time you link and update it. But, what is more surprising that PMO and other few offices of Central government don\'t have Aadhaar card details of Modi\'s Ministers.\n\nModi Government has made linking Aadhaar card mandatory to get benefits of all government services that the 125 crore Indian citizen utilise. But, PMO does not have the information about the Aadhaar card details of its own Ministers working under Modi government. This information has come to light through a reply which was provided to RTI Activist Anil Galgali for his query.\n\nGalgali said, "It is surprising to see that PMO or other few concern departments don\'t have data of Aadhaar card with them of their own ministers. Yes, PM does have an Aadhaar card number but due to security reason details were not given to me."\n\nMoreover, the RTI application filed by Galgali was transferred to 5 different Ministries. The RTO application made rounds to Cabinet Secretariat, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Information and Technology Ministry, and finally reached UIDAI where Galgali got an answer from the Under Secretary, PMO.\n\nThe information regarding the PM\'s Aadhaar number was rejected under Section 8(1) of the RTI Act 2005. Information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has not relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information officer or State Public Information officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such Information.\n\n"It shows that they say something but don\'t follow it. I would like to appreciate the efforts of RTI activist who brought this information in light. Common people are not getting benefits of government schemes unless they have Aadhaar card linked to Gas connection, bank etc but here we have ministers who have not shared their Aadhaar numbers it seems.

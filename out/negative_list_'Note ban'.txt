[old} Amit Shah’s co-operative bank at Ahmedabad Ashramam road gets Rs 500 crore deposit, just after notes ban
RBI Data Confirms Note Ban was a Total Failure
'Back then if one accused Shah ji of corruption in /r/india, she/he would have been eaten alive.\nI still remember people calling demo criticizers relatives of black money hoarders / disconnected from reality.'
'"Even opposition can\'t accuse us of corruption." \n\nAmit Shah'
'Deposit made due to technical reasons. Aage badho, no corruption. Next?'
'Why did we ever assume that BJP was "cleaner" than INC, when it comes to corruption?\n\nI doubt if this scandal is going to make a dent in BJP\'s popularity in Gujarat, going purely by social media and my family member\'s "bhakti" towards Modi.'
'All banks got deposits after notes ban. People came to the banks to deposit their money and co-operatives being accessible to the rural and small town folks, they would have seen a spike. It would be suspicious if it got deposits before notes ban implying they had prior knowledge.'
'Yeah..Amit shah was gonna wait for AFTER the ban. Fucking RIP Logic.'

'He snooped on a girl, man. Remember Mansi soni and saheb? At that time people were drunk on Modi’s aura. '
'exactly, do you remember how bjp leaders were mocking people for standing in line?\n\nhttps://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSi867R4cOxI&ved=0ahUKEwj4npOOserWAhVCNI8KHZQfCQwQwqsBCE8wCg&usg=AOvVaw2_5eUZT02wZk1cqlHrB-_U'
'First line of the article.\n\n*The former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Friday **alleged** that a decision to ban cooperative banks from doing business was taken three days after Rs. 500 crore was deposited in the Ashram Road Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank, in which BJP national president Amit Shah is a director.*'
'As demonitization had shaken the country, almost all of the population should know by now what politics are. If they(including me) are still not opening their eyes, they are just blind. \n\nEdit: The real problem is whom to elect. There is no alternative which can save us.   '
"Next, People will decide what's BJPs and Shahs fate. \n\nBJP has to carefully calculate between losing Amit Shah and losing some voters who hate corruption."
"Co operative banks not associated with shah,first they barred them from deposit ing banned notes with RBI but when shit got cooled down......They allowed it.\n\nnow if 'x' is a co operative bank which was not allowed to take de.onised notes from public then no one will go to them and opt for pvt n PSU banks.but if you are an insider then it's a completely different game.every 2 months national executive meet of BJP where only a handful of dear leaders follower get to sit on stage.see all the ignored senior leaders."
'And later [co-op banks got permission](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-allows-district-central-co-op-banks-to-exchange-old-notes/articleshow/59260926.cms) to deposit the 500 notes to RBI. They were the biggest source to deposit the banned Rs. 500 notes. '

"> Small time crooks?\n\nThey used to be. Remember the crook they killed so as to claim that there were terrorists out to kill mudikaka? That guy used to be Amitbhai's associate according to some reports I'd seen a while ago. They have indeed gotten too big, and as you mention, executed the biggest money laundering scheme. "
'They will do that as and when they get the chance.\nThis government has set dangerous precedents which will be rebooted to hell in future.'
'Sorry to say to they open co-operative to pull scandals...\n\nThis is nothing just search co-operative scandals and you will get what I mean!'
'Since when asking for evidence is wrong. Why does that make me a bhakt?'
"yeah seriously man. I voted for bjp thinking congress is worst. thought demonitization was good and was too young during 2002. never again. I'll vote for no one next time"
"you didn't see this when it released? it made me fucking angry"
"> Remember the crook they killed so as to claim that there were terrorists out to kill mudikaka? That guy used to be Amitbhai's associate\n\nwhat? i have no clue what you are saying. care to elaborate?"
'A 3-5% swing can do major damage to the majority BJP achieves in Gujarat. That would make the BJP nervous and keep it on its toes.'
">  I'll vote for no one next time\n\nThat's worse than voting for BJP. You're essentially voting for BJP twice. "
'Economy dwindles....Modiji does man ki baat....Tell janta ki vikas aur democracy not compatible....Look at China...Democracy dheema, me fast, demo is slow,mitron....\nAmbassador in era of tesla,mitron....\nAapko vikas chahiye ki nahi,mitron....\n70 saal democracy india still not=gujarat mitron so let us make new india mitron...\nHelp me mitron, mai poison piya, mere peeche dushman, mai aapka beta, mai gareeb, mai laachar,mai Batman, mai peter parker, mai hi eternal sunshine of spotless mind, mai hi brahmasmi, mitron,\nhai ki nahi...Hai ki nahi, mitron...\nBolo hain, nahi to sedition thok dunga mitron.\nHehehein mitron'
"Polarization of the country. Saffronization of our culture. Choking of the economy. Murder of exports. Death of our freedom and rights. Rise of Modinomics. We're fucked. "
'He must be right! BJP was close to get this country into unnecessary war! So they came with Surgical Strike thing in first place. Then Demonetisation, with demonetisation money laundering for other parties was difficult so only BJP had power to buy votes. '
"You can never be sure in a democracy,it could be Rabri devi also.\nI know it sounds pathetic but there's no fixed party or pm candidate, everything is unpredictable. "
'The article itself implies Shah is not responsible, he is just a director. There are countless companies that receive deposit on an everyday basis. Does anybody know who transferred it, and what was it for? Is the money accounted for and does the IT know about it? \n\nGrow up and start asking real questions rather than blindly living in your own bubble.'
"I have been a victim of modi's IT cells. I once made a logical comment against him on facebook and the replies I got were very harsh, rude and personal. I have never commented against him since. "
'Obviously, demo had flaws that defeated its stated purpose, but I don\'t think even the staunchest critic had imagined it would be such a flop. To have almost all black currency come back into circulation implies that everyone with "black" money was able to wash his money. Feels like a statistical anomany ... One so big that I am thinking conspiracy. Maybe some people returned fake money and got back white one. '
'Non-credible source. Fake news!! '
'The people of India are behind Modi. Failure or no-failure, he is destined to again become the PM of India in 2019. '
'We need to blame the bank for the DeMo failure not all but the corrupts..'
'No educated or even semi-informed person will like to vote for Modi in 2019 after this DeMo fiasco. But sir, what other option do we have in national leaders? RaGa?'
"Back when demo happened, people here were saying that on the ground everyone is suffering and people are cursing Modi & that Demo will be the fall of Modi and he will lose all elections.  \n\nNow, many of these same people (not talking about you - I don't know what you said) are saying Modi won because of this."
'Sarkar : Randiya... XXL tax payers increased how is DeMo a fail? Bolo...ab bolo. /s'
"Ok which charecter's fatality would you choose for him?\nI wouldlove to give him Kung Lao's."
'firstly.. what is the definition of black money? any money that is in circulation is white... whether its hoarded or stored in panama or in swiss banks or acquired by corrupt practices.\nmodi govt just wanted to bring in stupid policies to fuck with us.'
'> Failure or no-failure\n\nare you in a fucking cult?'
'Stop trying to bring logic and common sense into this man.. How dare you?!'
'Are you in a glitch or a glitch? Do you have an estimation of the money wasted on the whole process and printing new notes?'
"Vote for your local candidate and fuck national leader. Modi or RaGa won't come to work in your MP constituency.\nThink.\n\nOr Press NOTA"
'AAP cannot win nationwide, although they are the only logical choice. Otherwise press NOTA. fuck em. the problem is that NOTA wont solve anything... these fucking politicians will come anyways. Best option is to move out of the country.\nno reservation, no corruption.'
'The power of manipulation. '
"That's contrary to all the news reports about UP getting hit the most with cash shortage. Almost all the ATMs remained shut till December. Banks saw long queues and helpless people fought with each other to withdraw money."
"I was travelling alone when this masterstroke went off. I didn't even had a line to stand on."
"Everyone is stuck in the rain, you're complaining abt BMC. Where is your spirit?"
'In this whole Tom & Jerry game between political games, the common man is suffering. \n\nI still see people from low-income group struggling. Add to the Lokpal bill furor which made Anna Hazare to launch a protest. '
"If that is the case, how can we say that demonetization is a failure of the government? Only measure of success/failure of demonetization is increase in taxes collected. For example, if 30% more taxes collected, then the deposited money on which these taxes collected was black money. Since the tax is collected, that money is now become 'white' money"
'Damn. It was a total shit show then.'
"Suit yourself. I can't imagine how any govt can be worse than the current regime. If congress was cancer then this regime is Aids with Ebola. They aren't only incompetent, but downright dangerous for the country."
"Same here. I was enjoying my quiet vacation in a remote part in India  when suddenly the masterstroke was all over the news. There were only two banks that were filled with miles of people who came to exchange notes, and the ATMs didn't even start until a good whole month. I had to immediately cancel my vacation and go back in a hurry. If I was annoyed so much due to this, think about the small trader who hardly has any cash in hand. I don't know what the govt. achieved due to the demonetization thing, but whenever I try to picture those poor villagers in my mind, I think it was a worthless and reckless move that didn't achieve anything significant that couldn't have been otherwise possible without going through all this pain (unless you have achieved some hidden treasures that you are not willing to share with the public)."
'That and Muslim hating bigots.'
"Make it less cute and bring facts and figures to the table. They we can have a reasoned discussion on it.\n\nAs for your link, firstly it has no citations on it. I would not trust the numbers in it much and neither should you. Secondly, I couldn't care less if the IDS was introduced by Congress or BJP. What matters most is getting rid of corruption in this country.\n\n"
"Back when demo happened, people here were saying that on the ground everyone is suffering and people are cursing Modi & that Demo will be the fall of Modi and he will lose all elections.  \n\nNow, many of these same people (not talking about you - I don't know what you said) are saying Modi won because of this."
'I saw this assertion several times. Can you ELI5 how DeMo helped? (just the hype of fighting corruption, or was there some other aspects also) Seriously clueless ...'
'SAAR, no politician is saint and voters have to kick their ass. Cast negative vote, Press NOTA. Use your power SAAR atleast once in 5 year SAAR.'
"Now AAP has started working only and not making public statements but news channels will not show that. This biased and sold out media is one of the biggest problem. They are made to shake your beliefs from almost everything whether it's food, excercises, politics, religion etc etc."

Two judges out of 5 were representative of Pak intelligence agencies. \n\n3. His ouster got nothing to with Panama papers. Nothing at all. The courts have disqualified him on some unrelated technicality which seems like a farce. He was the chairman of some company in UAE while in exile. He did not draw salary from it. However undrawn salary means it's a receivable (ie Sharif is supposed to receive it) and therefore an asset. An asset which wasn't disclosed in his nomination papers in 2013. [Here](https://www.dawn.com/news/1348211/the-technicality-that-led-to-nawaz-sharifs-disqualification)    \n\n4. These same courts have legitimised dictatorships and given orders to hang a PM.  \n\nArmy has made a chutiya out of Sharif.   No need to rejoice. It's not good for Pakistan or India. "

In this social media age, Army has gained full legitimacy from the people through propaganda, something military govts excel in. A Constitution which has failed so many times implies the judiciary isn't really independent. Our judiciary isn't independent and one thinks theirs are? Right now, the army is taunting Bhutto's party that they're next. This means Army is going to have that pushover party elected next year or IK's party which has a chunk of former PPP members."
"It's pretty idiotic comparison. One guy made the money and hid it in tax free safe haven and the other hid his money in safe haven but can't prove how he got the money.\n\nFor all idiots who are praising Pak rule of law, don't have the clue why he was disqualified.  He was outsted by Pak Army because he was undermining them."

"> Till July, they did not charge any tax at all from customers, choosing to absorb the cost themselves. Their decision to pass on the levy to customers has led to increase in prices of saris by as much as 20%. \n\nGST rate is 12%, why did they have to increase by 20%? Besides it **replaces** existing taxes, prices shouldn't have needed to go up/down by more than the difference in tax rates, if they were all tax compliant\n\n>they did not charge any tax at all from customers, choosing to absorb the cost themselves.\n\nThis is why. They were not absorbing any costs, they were simply not paying any taxes."

You want a better India, well India needs capital to develop, where is it going to come from.\n\nI know a few Sari Shop owners and trust me, most are indifferent to GST and others are just unsure how much they will have to pay but they all have increased their prices and keep telling customers it's due to GST.\n\nIt's being used as an excuse to increase prices like how private sector used that recession bullshit for half a decade to hire underpaid modern slaves."
'A lot of people on this thread are of the mentality "those evil tax evaders had it coming", and are completely missing the point. Increasing the cost and complexity of compliance for *small businesses* is extremely harmful to growth. For growth to happen, you have to make it easier for businesses to begin and operate.\n\nFurthermore, GST isn\'t a tax on profit, the businesses aren\'t paying them out of their pocket. GST is a consumption based tax, *you* the customer are paying the taxes. Businesses just collect it and submit it to govt. \n\nWhy are small businesses protesting against GST? Because it raises compliance standards. It requires small businesses to hire CAs and lawyers to make any sense of the law. You might be thinking, "so what? Those evil injuns gotta pay!!".\n\nBut remember that these aren\'t taxes based on profits, these are consumption taxes that are levied on the customer. The taxes themselves aren\'t a burden, the cost of hiring CAs, cost of hiring lawyers, cost of losing customers, cost of losing margins etc, these are the problems businesses face. \n\nTo make this more relatable to the folks here. Let me give an example, suppose you are a fresh out of college engineer working in some IT company. You are depressed about your work and want to do something else, something unique, build a company. You were always good with woodworking. So you have an idea of making this neat little study desk with hidden compartments. You want to sell it online, because why the fuck not. Now here comes the zinger -\n\nYou have to charge 28% tax on your product. You bought the raw materials, and tools for 1500, rent + online fees is 200, transportation is 200, and you want to keep your margin at 600. So you want to sell it at 2500. Applying GST on this is a whopping 700!! Your selling price to customer goes upto 3200. Customer sees the price and is like "fuck you I ain\'t buying". This dousing your small business plans. Even if you aren\'t making sales, you have to file returns 3 times a month. Because you made purchases of a variety of raw materials and tools, your filing process is complicated. So now you have to hire a CA, let\'s say 1000 a month. Now you have more losses.\n\nNow if the GST was something sensible like 5%, the price to customer would be 2625, and customers would buy it because they think it is good VFM. Your business grows, profits come in, you hire more workers, expand into more cities. Good for India. \n\nBut with GST, your business would be DOA.'
'How many of you think govt can return gst paid every month? \nGst is like a nightmare for small business firms.'
'So basically what we know for sure is : They were not paying taxes before. They will have to pay taxes now. Looks like a good thing overall.\n\nCustomers are chaalu but if tax authorities are strict then first small businesses will fall in line and then the customers who wants to cheap out by not paying taxes.'

Let's say you compare a saree handloom weaver's products against similar saree products mass manufactured by machinery from some brand name.\n\nLet's say prior to the GST stuff the handwoven one cost 4000 rupees and the manufactured one cost 5000 rupees. The manufactured one paid taxes in its cost, the handwoven one didn't. The customer might consider to go with the handwoven one as it's cheaper vs easier availability of the manufactured one. \n\nNow post-GST the price of the handwoven comes close to the same cost or exceeds the manufactured one by including the tax. To the customer now with the price being similar or potentially more costly they are less likely to choose the handwoven option. So with less potential demand and likelihood that it takes up more time to weave the saree compared to the manufactured one what incentive does the weaver have to continue what they were doing?"

But elsewhere, handloom weavers mean craftsmen who do customized or niche products and charge higher than your average mill produced product. \n\nJust like fragmented farming isn't sustainable, neither are fragmented businesses. It makes little economic or social sense. Add to that it becomes impossible to impose labor regulation. Labor safety, minimum wage, no child labor all go out the window with the informal sector."
'Actually, GST is only on value addition. However, it is indirect and reconciliatory in nature i.e. tax credit'
"I am repeating it second time, I read the article, that's where my quoted text came from. \n\n>Unless you have those numbers, your accusing them of cheating amounts to prejudice.\n\nMy original comment said no such thing. And the article itself admits to them not being tax complaint before, how is me saying that prejudice?\n\n> Now, how many forms does one have to fill out, and how frequently? How much does the time spent on all this running around cost that small business?\n\nAre you suggesting that entire 20% hike is due to this? If they were all tax complaint before, the only additional hit should be due to increase compliance requirements."
">I would rather people read the article before acting all preachy.\n\nMan, I was not at all preachy in my original comment. You put words in my mouth and forced my hand into it. So I am not even going to get into a debate with rest of it.\n\nOk, Let me try to convey my original point mathematically:\n\nAmount of price hike = Effective GST rate - [Cumulative tax rates it replaced]  + Increased compliance cost.\n\nEffective GST rate = Some weighted average of [ 5%, 12%, 18% ] = Definitely between 5 and 18. I will just be generous and pick something on higher end and pick 15%.\n\n[Cumulative tax rates it replaced] = Service tax + VAT + Excise + more random taxes on all labor and materials involved. \n\nI am going to assume a service tax of 5% and VAT of 4% and Excise of 2% . These rates are all on lower end of what they probably were, just to give traders benefit of doubt.\n\nIf I put these numbers back:\n\nAmount of price hike =Effective GST rate - [Cumulative tax rates it replaced]   + Increased compliance cost.\n\n 20 = 15  - 11   + Increased compliance cost.\n\nUnless there is a 16% overhead due to increased compliance cost. safe to assume taxes were being evaded.( <- This was my only point. There was no judgement or preachiness there )\n\nPeace out!\n\n\n>I would rather people read the article before acting all preachy\n\nFor the third time in this same damn chain, I read the fucking article!!! I didn't know I am obligated to paraphrase the entire article just so that people believe me. "
"> Goes on to prove that you did not read the article. GST on polyester is 18%. From the article that you apparently read\n\nFrom how we've been implementing GST, you always tax at the highest liable rate. So a polyester and cotton mix sari is treated as a polyester sari. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause one could add a single strand of cotton in the weave and call it a mix and so on. I can't give you legal backing behind this (because there are no precedents for something like this) but HSN classification is generally on the highest matching bracket unless specified by exclusions.\n\nIts not very complicated. People are uninformed though. There are some loopholes however.\n\nFor example books are 0% GST, but raw materials aren't. So ultimately, the publisher has to charge net negative tax credit as per GST laws which makes little practical sense. But I guess that's how its supposed to pan out?\n\nFinally, doing business anywhere tax compliant requires just as much legalese but they simplify it via better [portals](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/). Its kind of like our traffic laws. A lot of people aren't even aware of what these laws are and that's exactly where professions like CA come in handy.\n\nYes its going to raise the cost of doing business in the short term. But unfortunately given the state of our nation, its very much required. That's not to say that GST law is good. Its poorly thought out and can be implemented in a much much better fashion. Single tax rate for example "
"Which isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, work safety guidelines. You can enforce this on a formal sector but can't on an informal one. Likewise for child labor.\n\nOf course, it should be easier to formalize a business if you have valid documentation, but that's besides the current discussion"
'Since the discussion is about tax at restaurants I would like to know what should be the tax rate for restaurants in food courts at malls. AFAIK 18% is for AC restaurant. Is it same for food courts?'
'https://cleartax.in/s/impact-gst-food-services-restaurant-business\n\nAs per this example on cleartax, they have levied GST on service charge as well'

'> Service charge is optional. You have the right to not pay the service charge and this must not be included in the final bill.\n\nDepends. This is the official statement from Govt \n\n"Service charge does not exist. It is being wrongly charged. We have prepared an advisory on this issue. We have sent it to the PMO for approval. No customer should be forced to pay service charge. If customers want they can pay a tip to waiters or **give their consent to levy the charge in the bill."**\n\nAlmost all restaurants and pubs in Delhi have put hugh signboards at entry saying that by dining in there, you are consenting to service charge.\n\n> If a service charge is levied, GST can NOT be levied on the service charge.\n\nSource for this? GST is 18% on services and service charge should come under services provided.'
"Let's say i have had food worth 100 rs in an ac restaurant. What's\u200b the minimum net bill including gst and all? Can somebody explain?"
'>If a service charge is levied, GST can NOT be levied on the service charge.\n\nCan you please explain why it cannot be levied? GST on services is 18%. Are restaurant services exempted from this?'
'Please do a manual check. I recently bought 2800 worth stuff from Best Price and on the bill they only showed 2400 worth items for some weird reason. \n\nThe final total after adding the tax(Rs.150) was correct though. Weird '
"A friend showed me a bill recently,and it had **two GST tax levied**.. **'S GST'** And **'C GST'**\n\nBoth were marked as 6%\n\nIs this correct..??"
">don't eat here.\n\nThat's exactly what you should do. Good luck to those Restaurant owners running the place with that attitude."
'Wow that sure is ignorant and rather egoistic on their part. Thankfully haven\'t faced such an issue of someone being "you either pay us the service tax or fuck out of here" here in NCR. But that being said, some cafe\'s do apply service taxes in the final bill, if you wish to not pay it you can just ask them to not include it and they\'ll get you a fresh bill without the service taxes included.

"Lack of understanding of taxes. It's worth giving money to a CA to get them sorted so you can focus on your business. Taxes and Compliance can take care of itself for a little cost."
"> .if a restaurant is charging, you can't deny that. \n\nYou can. You have the right to waive it off. "
"Exactly. If the restaurant or pub has clearly declared right at the entrance or on the menu that there's a service charge, you are committing to pay it, and cannot rescind it later. Otherwise, there's always the option of takeaway. I think of service charge as the charge for staying at the establishment, and not ordering delivery/take-away. Otherwise, they could merely increase the prices of the menu items by the service charge % and achieve the exact same outcome anyway, and offer a discount for delivery/takeaway."
"But shouldn't the tax be on the value added? Say, your rs:100 rum gets sold for Rs:130 in a restraunt. Shouldn't the 18% tax be on rs:30 ?"
"AFAIK, under the old system, 60% of the restaurant bill was taxed as 'goods', while 40% was charged as 'services'. \n\nWhat you are saying seems unfair. Since the consumer isn't buying Rs. 100 worth of services. \n\nEdit:\n\nFor eg. Maharashtra had 12.5% service tax for resturants, so we paid 12.5% × 40% = 5% of the whole bill. \n\n[This article](http://www.livemint.com/Money/b2PncJtGxNccw4T3qI7CGN/The-things-you-pay-for-apart-from-the-meal.html) should help you understand better.

'Alcohol has been kept out of the ambit of GST. Please go do some reading.'
'So you should not eat at a restaurant like to eat at because the restaurant is doing something illegal?'
"Yeah, mandatory tipping in a way. Only the owners don't always pass it on to the servers, which is why sometimes servers still hope for a tip even when service charges were applied. "
"if the service you got was satisfactory, you can't."
">  I get stuff for less than MRP all the time. And it's not bad stuff going stale or stock clearance\n\nagain,  exception not the norm."
"Then what constitutes consent? Is a restaurant supposed to get a contract signed at the start? A huge signboard is pretty clear - this place charges service tax and if you don't like it, don't eat here. It's a free country and if the restaurant wants to charge a service tax and is upfront about it, then you pay or don't dine there. Simple. \n\n"
'Thank you the confirmation :) \n\nI read about the GST implementation by the center and the state a while back too. '
'1. I have a big family. We go out for lunch once a month. If cost per person is 700, the bill is easily above 5k for 12 people.\n\n2. Corporate parties. Work at a startup, friday parties means 22-25 people going out for food and drinks. Bill is easily above 25k.'
'Interesting. Thank you.'
"> Only the owners don't always pass it on to the servers\n\nWhich is why you should not pay it. The costs, salaries and heavy profits are already accounted for in the item prices. Hotel owners just want to buy more gold for their wives or more cars for their fat kids.\n\n/ _judgemental_ rant"

'>the bill is easily above 5k for 12 people.\n\nIt all makes sense now as to why the restaurant didnt argue with you over service charge'
'How to find an investor to support this lifestyle '
"> He gets a loyal customer who doesnt order online or goes to mall\n\nloyalti ki roti bageki kya? i can't get how naive and short sighted you can be.\n\nalso how does he know that you don't shop online or go to a mall? did he make you sign a contract? for all you know he is selling things at inflated MRP and then giving you items by ignoring that in which case you are the idiot for continuing to buy things from him/her. MRP is decided by the wholesaler keeping in mind the margin of\nprofit for the retailer and the transport cost. If the retailer is letting go of that margin then he/she is an idiot."
'Idk ask the founders. The company itself is now in the phase of making profits. Plus, the employees are not paid heavy salaries like in other startups. Friday parties cost 1k/head AT MAX. So, just 4k/person/month. Since the pay is lesser than the market, they can afford this.'

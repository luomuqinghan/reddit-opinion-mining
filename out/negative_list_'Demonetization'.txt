"On a tangential note, I wonder why the skewed sex ratio hasn't solved the dowry problem yet? One'd have thought the lack of enough brides would have given the girl's parents enough options where they wouldn't have to pay any dowry. Especially in Noida/Delhi. \n\nSomewhat anecdotally, in some rural areas in Karnataka, there is now an almost streamlined process of finding suitable brides from rural northern India. And of course there is magnitudes more geographical mobility for middle class. So clearly geographical (and even cultural to an extent since they'd have preferred brides from their own community) barriers are breaking up both for rural & urban situations. Information barriers (i.e who is eligible etc) will erode faster with higher internet penetration and more Shaadi.com/Tinder-like apps. \n\nSo what was the issue in Noida that stopped more information (in terms of internet & matchmaking sites) and demand-supply economics from killing the dowry practice? Or is the explanation that the dowry demands are slowly reducing due to these external forces and it's just too soon/naive to expect a centuries-old practice to have died already?"

'>Demonitization saves girls from being married to wrong person.\n\nWell, almost 95% of marriages in India happen with dowry, so it is not like she was getting married to the wrong guy by mistake. Here everyone is in the same boat. However, I am not blaming it on demonetization. Even in tier 3 towns many Jewellers and Automobile sellers etc. accept payment by card. TOI just took an incident, simplified it to fit their agenda and printed it. These days journalism means not asking the questions and writing stories with a thousand holes.'

"Say fuck you you worthless scum. Can you not earn that shit yourself, don't go begging for luxuries."

"> blatantly accepting dowry\n\nNothing wrong in dowry. why is it wrong? dowry torture is wrong. dowry is not wrong.\n\nIf girls' parent give the girl child her fair share of paternal property, there would be no need of dowry. Just saying. Blame selfish parents of girl child.

"why no fuck to bride's family? they also deserve a good fuck. They agreed to pay. "
"> Aren't all such purchases through Cheque or Card ?\n\nI asked this same question yesterday and someone around here gave the answer that made sense. Its all about the lack of cushion for spending the white money now. There are lots of corrupt babus in our country who had lots of black income. This black income used to be spent on necessities in cash, whereas the above white income was free to be spent on luxuries like cars and other things. Now that the black cushion has disappeared due to note-ban, they are forced to spend the white on necessities, thus the lack of demand in the auto and finance sectors. If you see the stock markets closely, it is reflecting this very thing right now!"
'Bhai the report said that marriage was called off specifically due to inability to raise cash. '
"This is literally an example of going out of one's way to hate on Kejriwal. He's sympathising with a victim of the system being further affected by this move. You think the family has a choice of not paying the dowry? Get out of your bubble wrapped room and see reality for what it is. "

'The person who cancelled marriage for money is wrong person. Period'
'I wanted to down vote you. You might be wrong, but this question is thought provoking, to me at least. Have an up vote.\n\n'
"The groom is scared if they go ahead with the marriage the bride might backtrack after the wedding and not pay. After that it would be too late. \n\nAfter 8 months of wedding planning, it is lovely to see the kind of trust and family bonding which has developed between them. Foundation of any solid relationship. \n\nIt will be consensual only when it is the norm. Even the bride's family will demand even higher dowry when it is their turn to get their son married. \n\nIt is vicious cycle which causes a lot of issues. People would feel burden if they have girls, especially only girls. They feel that they can't get the money back similarly through dowry if they don't have a son.\n\nThat's why it is still a problem even it is consensual. "

If the government, on weighing the pros and cons, still decided to go ahead with demonetisation, the note outlined the preparation that would be needed, and the time that preparation would take.”\n\nOnly 6% of black money was estimated to be in cash form. Most of it was in foreign shores or as gold or benaami property.\n\nAnyone with an ounce of brain would say that disrupting the country over 6% of the total pie is stupid. It is much better to go after bigger pieces of the pie in property and foreign cash where not everyone would be inconvenienced.\n\nThis was the very reason why I thought this move came from a very dishonest position right from day one.

They just decided to drop him at some point when it became evident he couldn't be convinced to play along with their harebrained idea. \n\nIf anything, this interpretation makes them look worse. They had an economist who correctly predicted the 2008 crisis telling them that this was a bad idea, who explained *why* it was a bad idea - and they ignored it, planned out DeMo from Feb to Nov 2016, ousted RR and they *still* faced the exact same consequences he warned them about.

'Most riots start because of small things. Even recent saharanpur violence started like that. It started because a guy from Rajput community got killed.\n\n>The tensions between Hindus and Muslims had been running high since the kidnap of a Dalit girl by some Muslims in March 1980. The Dalits and Muslims used to live in separate bastis (colonies) near an Idgah. The girl was later rescued, and her kidnapper was arrested. In July, on the day of her marriage to a Dalit boy, some Muslims obstructed the marriage procession complaining about loud music near the mosque. The argument soon escalated into a violent clash between the two communities, followed by looting of several houses.[4]\n\n>On 13 August 1980, a domesticated pig from the Dalit colony strayed into the Idgah during the Id prayer. Around 50,000 Muslims were attending Eid Miladun Nabi prayers at the location. The Muslims, who considered the pigs as haraam, believed that the pig had been deliberately released by the Hindu Dalits.[5] They asked an on-duty policeman to chase the pig away, but he refused to do so, leading to a heated argument. *The violence broke out when some Muslims pelted stones at the policemen.[4] The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) collapsed when a stone hit his forehead, and the Additional District Magistrate (ADM) DP Singh was dragged away by some people; he was found dead later. The policemen then started firing indiscriminately into the crowd. The police force was reinforced by the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) troops that arrived in trucks along with the District Magistrate.[6] Several Muslims were killed in the firing; about 50 more lost their lives in a stampede that followed the firing.* **The Muslim leader Syed Shahabuddin later compared the firing to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.**\n\nComparison to Jallianwala Bagh , did this guy even know anything about those brave hearts.

'ban RSS? when the present incumbent is its proud member?'
'It is already banned in r/india '
'> Are people actually being killed for transporting cows?\n\nYes. Not even transporting, even being "suspected" of transporting them. Even if you\'re doing it completely legally. '
'There have been cow slaughter bans in many states for varying number of years, even decades.\n\nWhile the bans themselves are religiously motivated and were put in place as way of appeasing high caste Hindu votebanks for political gains,  such a ban would be unconstitutional if put in place for that reason, so  politicians figured out round about ways to implement the ban.(Not very different from Trump\'s way of implementing his Muslim travel ban.)\n\n Initially they claimed it was put in place to help boost the dairy and farming industry.. which relied on these animals and faced shortages. (This argument no longer holds water  sincefarming has become modernised/mechanised and we have a surplus of milk production now.)\n\nBut even in states which had instituted such bans, they only targetted young cows. Oxen and buffaloes and even older cows were not covered by such ban. And the implementation of the ban too was quite lax.\n\nBut since 2014, when the BJP (A right-wing Hindu nationalist politcal party) swept to power with an independent majority at the centre.(A first for them and only the third party in Indian history to achieve it.) they have been toughening up these laws in all the states where they control the govt.... making the existing  bans more comprehensive, extending it to oxen and imposing stiff criminal penalties for even the possession of beef for personal consumption. And they have also encouraged the formation of vigilante "gau rakshaks" (cow protectors) who are sometimes even funded by the state government to take care of cows but they mainly thugs with political aspirations using this as an excuse to harass and settle scores with  non-Hindus and lower caste Hindus.\n\nSo there have been many incidents across the country of these vigilantes beating up people and in some cases even killing them. And the police instead of arresting them, tend to focus their investigations on the victims. In one prominently covered case, where a Muslim man was murdered by a mob, the cops sent the meat found in his fridge for DNA testing.\n\nAnd this month the central government notified a nationwide ban on trade of cattle for purposes other than farming. The reason is supposedly to prevent animals from being sent for ritualistic torture in neighboring Nepal, but the language ensures that no one can trade in cows/buffalos/camels for meat. (This is again a twisted way of imposing their religious agenda on the country.. .since the central government cannot impose such bans since under the separation of powers this is a state subject, but they are using the excuse of cross-border trade to issue this notification.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

"We should stop assuming that demonetisation was for anything else than shits and giggles. It might have some aim when it was conceived . But I strongly suspect that has become irrelevant long back. Now the whole economy runs on whatsapp forwards. I used to do hardly any cash transactions before demonetisation. Now I am forced to do more. UPI is not ready for primetime yet. Wallets are hit and miss depending on the vendor. Most vendors don't want to take paytm if they have crossed their monthly free transfer limit. Last week I got a note with a light tear(from the ATM). I am yet to find a vendor that will take it ."
'Got charged 0.75% to fill up my fuel the other day. Fuck this motherfucking bullshit.'
"My uncle was killed by demonetization.\n\nThis happened around 3-4 weeks after demonetization was implemented.\n\nMy cousin's son (aforementioned uncle's grandson) was killed in a road accident in Mysore on a Sunday afternoon. My mother left for my cousin's house with whatever cash we had at home in new notes (around 10K) so that my cousin could pay for the funeral expenses (all the other relatives were pitching in with new notes too). I was supposed to leave the next morning at 6 am and reach Mysore by 9 for the funeral which was scheduled at 11. \n\nHowever, my uncle who was traveling that night from Madurai to Mysore for his grandson's funeral had a heart attack on the train at around 6:30 am. My aunt who was traveling with him isn't very capable of managing emergencies and called my father (who's again in Mysore for the funeral). Since the train passes through Bangalore on the way to Mysore from Madurai, I reached the railway station arranged for an ambulance and took my uncle off the train and to the ambulance. \n\nAnd then the ordeal started.\n\nRush hour traffic in Bangalore with a heart attack patient on board. Went to 3 different hospitals including one of the biggest ones in Bangalore, all of them refused admission unless I could put down a 1 Lakh deposit in cash. Never mind that I had my debit card with enough money in the account and was willing to swipe it. Nope they wanted cold hard cash in new notes.\n\nFinally the assistant guy on the ambulance suggested we go to a smaller hospital which might admit him without a deposit. So finally after wasting ~4 hours trying to admit him to good hospitals (which wouldn't because they wanted cash in new notes), he was accepted by a small hospital, where he passed away later. We were told that if he was brought in earlier there was a very good chance we could have saved him.\n\n________________________\n\nAnother incident, just a week after demonetization my grandmother passed away.\n\nWe had to take everything on credit because literally no one had cash to pay for anything. Funeral services on credit, gravedigger on credit, funeral catering on credit, hearse on credit. As though a bereaved family hasn't got enough to deal with. Luckily since our family was well known to all those people (catering service, funeral people, gravediggers), they were willing to defer payment for services rendered. Horrible.\n\n_____________________________\n\nAnd yet another incident. The day demonetization was announced, I was in Pushkar, returning to Bangalore. I had Rs 2300 in my pocket, of which 2000 was rendered useless. So effectively I had Rs. 300 to make it all the way from Pushkar to Bangalore. \n\nSpent Rs. 16 on the bus ticket to Ajmer (Rs. 284 left with me now). In Ajmer I had to take a share auto to the railway station from the bus stand, ended up bartering a juice box I had with the auto driver in lieu of the Rs 10 payment. On the train from Ajmer to Jaipur I bartered a pack of biscuits I had with a family seated opp to me for a bottle of water. In Jaipur no cabs or rickshaws were plying because of no cash Ola and Uber drivers for some reason thought that transactions (not notes) above Rs. 500 had been banned and refused trips to the airport from the railway station thinking they wouldn't get paid. Had to take multiple buses which ended up costing me around Rs. 15 and then hitchike to the airport. Thankfully my flight was paid for. When I reached Bangalore Rs. 265 for the bus ticket home. When I reached home I reached home with Rs. 4 in my pocket. Absolute nerve wracking nightmare."
"It's us who were getting fucked before Demonetization as well."

"Of course it's us getting fucked after demonetization. And they will use demonetization as an excuse for every failure of financial policy / the economy during this period. Poor GDP growth? All due to de-mo. Low industrial output? De-mo! Make in India is not really happening? De-mo! Indian economy no longer the fastest growing economy? De-mo! Who cares about proper introspection and analysis of failures, let's promote the thinking of 'all is well and we'd have had a stellar performance if not for de-mo'.\n\n\nWe really need the counterweight of a strong opposition party in our political system, and that's just not there right now."
'The purpose of demonetisation is to force you to use systems (like online/electronic banking) so that the government can ultimately track and tax you to death. Not to mention create a one path system where banks can screw you over with fees.\n'
'I don\'t know which location you are from. But here in Hyderabad,I am very happy this happened. Of course there were initial trouble to find ATMs and all, But I don\'t expect the "change we need in our country" without any hassle. I think people need to look at the things a different way. Let me explain you what I know/think. Completely personal opinion.\n\nLet me explain Black money, according to me. Black money is something which is not in banks but in Hard cash. \nBasics : Every individual has to pay some tax from the money he is having, Because that\'s how it works.(For ex. He individual is earning 100rs, has to pay 10rs to government as tax.ie. to get Roads, street lights and garbage collection etc. etc. Again, this all for the convenience of the said individual.). \nProblem : Now the individuals who are are taking the hard cash, the money which is not accounted, are simply hiding it. (For ex. the individual who has to pay 10rs as tax from 100rs he is earning, is saying he is earning only 50. and paying only 5rs.). Some individual are hiding this money in crores through some shady business. Now due to this, The GDP of the country is effected.(GDP is a whole new subject, http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/199.asp , If any one interested). To control this, our Modi ji has started this plan/process/demonitization. The individual who hide crores are now useless. Now Normal earning people say they are effected with this. Saying ATMs are not having money. Let me tell you.. Modi ji\'s plan is to stop people from using Hard cash. Money should be in banks which can be accountable, not outside. If a shop keeper doesn\'t take card, and just wants hard cash, he is storing black money. Stop buying from him. When demonitization started the local shopkeepers near my house did not take cards even though some shopkeepers got Card machines. Their plan was to show less income and avoid taxes. This plan doesn\'t workout for them now. Now every shopkeeper near my house has card machines. I hardly have Hard cash with me.  Just ATM cards or credit cards. I love this digital age. I love where our india is going now. Just view things the diffrent way, and you will notice the changes and development.\n'

'The simple reality is that India is a third world banana republic corrupt at every level of govt. You can\'t do a single darn stupid thing without being extorted to pay a bribe. The only thing India stands on is this heightened sense of patriotism that is brainwashed into our mindsets from this USSR era socialistic educational system.... even on reddit you have this banner of "united we stand". You know what, it\'s time to ditch this stupid sense of patriotism and remember it\'s every man for himself. Govt. has been using this stupid sense of patriotism as a means to achieve their own goals of power and authority. 300+ million people live below poverty line, 300+ million people do not have access to electricity. 90% of the economy is in unorganized labor and 95% is cash based and 85% of this cash is in 500 rs and 1000 rs notes and the govt with the stroke of the pen banned 85% of the money supply overnight in the name of making India a greater economy and people living in the big cities who are in the IT sector and the youngsters who use plastic and EFT for most transactions are fine with this brute force of govt. because it\'s part of the "digital economy" BS. And they expect everyone to stand in line for hours to get a messily 2000rs that won\'t be enough for even the basics. And the 1diot in chief expects old people and those in the labor class who are not well versed in modern technology to use "digital economy".... what a dictator. You can\'t even access and use your own money which you worked hard for and paid taxes for without being treated like a criminal. And people are fine with forcing everyone in this 95% cash economy to use this "digital economy" overnight so all these EFT payment processors and solutions can skim from each transaction.\n\nWell, if you think this is not fine, then time to get a passport, visa and find a greener pasture where you don\'t have to put up with this kind of BS.

'Just a thread where we Indians are criticising our government.\n\nThe right-wing, nationalist government which was elected in 2014 came to power with the promise of development.\n\nA month back, they decided to implement an ill thought out move to demonetise the higher currency notes to stop corruption and encourage digital transactions. \n\nSince India is a huge country with a largely illiterate population, this move has brought immense problems for most citizens. Specially since higher currency notes formed 86% of the total cash flow. '

'Just a weekly thread (almost turning into a daily routine lately) whining and moaning about how we\'re all doomed and that they\'re the only ones who seems to see it and everyone else is either brainwashed or a blind follower of Modi(the PM)/BJP(political party in power). I\'m starting to think that these people are part of some social media cell of the INC(the main opposition party). \n\n\nSo the PM made a decision to demonetize the high value notes without informing anyone(the 500 and the 1000 Rupee note), including his own party members(or so they claim, who the hell knows) with the stated intent to go after the black money, move the economy towards a digital economy(the phrase used was less-cash economy I believe), and fight the counterfeit notes currently in circulation.\n\n\nNow the black money is the money that people are hoarding and not paying taxes on, thus also not having the money circulate in the economy, which asking any economist will tell you is not good for said economy. Unlike most of the developed world, people do hoard money in this country. Especially the politicians who also double as thugs and gangs a lot of the time. We\'re not talking just couple thousand dollars worth but the amount tends to be in millions of dollars worth. Across the country, by far too many people. This move forced a lot of those people to now deposit said money in the bank while also disclosing where and how they got this money or risk having most of it turn useless. Now if it\'s found out that this money was gotten illegally or was not taxed, the Income Tax Department could take action on these people. There were also a few schemes introduced to let people declare their money before hand several months ago and steps were also taken to get more people into the banking system.\n\n\nAs for going digital is concerned, the rationale was that it\'ll be easier to keep track of people\'s money so that it can be taxed properly. Because right now only 2 to 3 percent of the population pay taxes. This move will hopefully increase the tax base. Whether it succeeds or not remains to be seen, as the full effects of this move will not be seen until Feb of next year, at least. Keeping track of people\'s money should also make it easier to combat the corruption and the bribery culture that is rampant in India. \n\n\nAs for the counterfeit money, a lot of our domestic terrorists tend to operate on fake currency and there were also reports that the ISI (the pakistani intelligence agency) was slowly flooding the Indian market with fake currency, and that they were also funding extremist groups around the country, almost exclusively with the large denomination notes. Now scrapping these large notes and replacing them with different ones was so that the funds to these groups would dry out quickly. And it takes a lot of times and money to get make good counterfeit currency again, unlike what many here seem to believe. This also plays into the going digital push, as it\'ll be easier to keep track of the money if the majority is done digitally. \n\n\nNow these were the stated goals and they were lofty goals. Whether they will be achieved or not remains to be seen. The bloody move still hasn\'t even been completed yet. The last day of the whole demonetization(or re-monetization as they\'re calling it now) exercise will end on Dec 31st I believe. The earliest we\'ll see the results of this whole things should be around Feb of next year. The long term impact will not be clear until even later. \n\n\nBut the majority on r/India has already decreed that this is stupidest move in history and that it has and will not have any benefits whatsoever. That this has destroyed the economy. And that the people are suffering and are in agony because they have to wait in lines. I have family living in the middle of nowhere in some no name village in India. I also have family who live in cities and even three relatives who work in banks. Now they all agree that yes people are not happy that they have to wait in ridiculously long lines, sometimes for nothing because the ATMs keep running out of cash. My grandparents and cousins who live in villages had to deal with trying to setup a proper bank account and trying to understand going digital through credit cards and phone payments. It hasn\'t been that easy on them or the people they know. My banker relatives were completely overworked the past few weeks. \n\n\nBut the one sentiment that they all shared was that atleast this government was doing something. Anything. To combat the corruption that has plagued this country for decades under the INC(Indian National Congress) rule. The INC made corruption the backbone and bribery the culture of this country for the half century that they ruled this nation. Their last PM was known for maintaining a "dignified" silence as his party was found to be complicit in one scam after another. What amazes me is that everything that the people on this sub accuse the BJP and Modi of doing is something the INC is far more guilty of. India has seen far more communal divide and riots and decisions and measures that are closer to fascist regimes under the INC rule than we have seen under the BJP rule. Everyone here seems to conveniently forget how the INC looted this country for decades. And just how many hundreds of millions were truly suffering and dying under their rule. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Not a fan or the supporter of BJP. I believe that the top leadership of BJP is filled with either corrupt or incompetent idiots. I believed it when they were in the opposition and they\'ve done little to change that perception. But they\'re about a thousand times better than all the opposition parties combined right now. '
"Our government lead by the ultra nationalist Bharat Janta Party implemented a Machiavellian policy to loot money from the people and at the same time liquidate money for banks. They demonitised ₹500 and ₹1000 notes giving us till 31 th December to get new notes. Anybody who doesn't return cash money until then loses money. Then the government is having difficulties printing put the new cash so chaos. Then they are being partial by releasing newly printed cash in constituencies that vote for their party. \n\n\n\nThis tldr, our nationalist government fucked us over."
'A lot of demonetization haters are misguiding you in believing that it is a bad move. The other side of the story is that there are many supporters of demonetization and probably they are in plenty. /r/india is a bunch of frustrated individuals who love to bitch about the problems in the country. If it was really a bad move, there would have been riots and protests across the country. However, the public has been co-operating with the govt to maximum extent. I as an honest tax payer support the move because it brings in a lot of individuals and businesses under the perview of income tax (which they evaded in past by always dealing with cash).\n\nHope this helps you with other side of the story.'

Hence this 1% fee is a completely NEW charge.\n* The Banks sent a letter to Pumps on Saturday saying that charges will be effective fro MIDNIGHT. This was the most ridiculous thing. \n* Petrol pumps effectively make 0.75% margins, especially the smaller ones make less margins. A 1% fee will mean that they will be selling petrol at a loss on every card transaction. \n\n\nThus, the media is putting the blame on the easy skapegoat the pumps instead of highlighting the BANKS who are responsible for this sudden problem.

Demand draft by its very nature is your money guaranteed, this is why you cant use a normal credit card transaction to buy it -  you could of course take a cash advance from your credit card and use it to buy a dd. The difference is that on the cash advance interest usually starts instantly and a higher rate than normal purchases, because the credit card company is only making money of you, not the vendor.

One weekend, long before the demonetization, my debit card did not come out of the ATM machine and the message read something like "Your card has been taken. Go to your nearest branch". It was Saturday and I had absolutely no cash with me and my only card was gone. I ran to the nearest branch before they close on Saturday afternoon and the manager says it is a random security measure. WTF? I also ran out of fuel by that time, so, I had to take the public transport to beg a friend and borrow money. I had to reapply for a card at the "account branch" and they sent the card 14 days later and the PIN a few days later and I had to go to the branch once again to activate the PIN/card.

It is very optimistic to assume that 50% of the new converts will pay next year.\n\nIf they hide their new income with the new 500 and 2000 bills, they can\'t be caught with any scrutiny. If cash income could be caught, there would have been no need for demonetisation in the first place, right? They can\'t be fined a penalty based on an extrapolation of last year\'s income. The IT department has to prove they had undeclared income in the current year.\n\nThe only way to make most of these people pay is to keep demonetising periodically and/or clamp down much harder on cash transactions. Neither is a practical solution.'

'What "push to digital"? Only \'white\' transactions will happen digitally, and \'black\' transactions will continue to happen in cash. This cannot be fixed as cash will continue to exist for ever. People will buy gold / forex / whatever. Demonetization was, and will always be, quite an ineffective fix to the problem of corruption.'
"> What do you think push to digital is all about??\n\nSee the cost of going digital has to come from somewhere. Who pays for all that? As it stands today, a 100 rupee products nets the seller 100 rupees when sold in cash, and only 97 odd when sold over digital modes. Unless there is a digital mode that ensures universal access (with no need for internet) and no middleman fee, cash would stay the way it is. \n\nUSSD worked so well. But it happens through IMPS and this costs money. For a start, the government should at least waive off IMPS charges if it wants to promote digital. Again, that's a cost that is getting written off somewhere in the government's account books. But if the government doesn't want to take a loss, why do you expect a trader to take it?"
'My point was this is not about loopholes, there is a giant gaping hole named cash which cannot be plugged, so all such initiatives are pointless and cause nuisance to legit people while being trivial to bypass for \'black\' transactions.\n\nThe upper limit on cash txns is a joke. \'Black\' cash transactions are off-book so the on-book limit does not matter. For example, while buying a flat, if someone pays 50 lakh in cash, that doesn\'t appear on any books so there is no question of a limit being exceeded. The real way to fix this would be to fix the loopholes that are exploited for money laundering. This is of course very difficult, but I am not even convinced that there is enough political will to fix all those problems. All this "cash txn limit" stuff is essentially bullshit for PR.   '

"Imagine you have a political party and you are raising black money i.e. cash. The whole point of cash is that it's OFF THE BOOKS - not audited, no records, no knowledge of its existence. This is the money used to pay for thuggery, extortion, criminal activity, general malfeasance and other nefarious work.\n\nThe entire goal of black money is to escape record keeping. If you DEPOSIT YOUR BLACK MONEY IN THE BANK  as a political party, you are exempt from Income Tax scrutiny because you are already being scrutinized by your mandatory audit process. This effectively paints a giant bulls eye on the backs of your accounting firm, because if you deposit crores of old notes, they have to show a paper trail for these notes or risk criminal prosecution themselves. \n\nI'm not entirely sure how one would perpetrate a scam from this rule - can someone detail the process?"

"You have 1 crore in black money. \n\nIf you declare it to govt., you'll lose 50% as tax+penalty. 25% will be held in govt. bonds for 4 years. And you'll be left with 25%. And be on a watchlist for future raids and audits and harassment by IT Dept.\n\nInstead you give your money to any political parties.\n\nThey'll claim they got lots of small donations of less than 20k from over 500 people. \n\nAnd boom... your money is now 100% white. \n\nNow comes the little matter that your money is no longer with you.\n\nBut there are multiple ways to work around this... \n\nThe political party can give you/your company some inflated business contract(or even a non-existent one.) for 50% of the value you donated.  And you'll get the same amount of your money back as declaring it and paying tax/penalties and you'll get it back way sooner, no waiting for 4 years.\n\nOr if you are willing to forgo the money completely, you'll be compensated with cushy govt. contracts worth many times more. \n\nIt's a win-win-win situation for everyone except the law abiding tax paying people who are going to be standing in queues for another 3-6 months.\n\n\n"

"There's a friend who used to work in Axis who says employees were almost forced to do under handed and unethical stuff to meet steep targets. All these scams seems to be a byproduct of the culture of the organization."
'(Serious q) Why cant Axis banks license be cancelled after this?'
'How to complain to the IT dept? I know another Axis bank branch where this shit is going on.'
"Few other illegal/Unethical things which Axis Bank did during my 6 years there . I was part of liabilities acquisition and operation.( I am sure other banks did this too). \n\n1. Illegal: When you open an account , you need to deposit a minimum amount of Rs 10k or 5k as initial deposit either through cash or from your account in other banks. Before RBI made this rule, banks used to take cash of Rs. 50L/75Lacs and keep in their sundry accs and once the customer's account opens ,transfer the initial deposit into his account. In these cases, the Initial deposit is shown as bank transfer and not cash deposit. RBI until 2010/11 allowed this to happen ( they just werent clever enough and didnt have resources to figure all this). Everyone in the banks used to go a mad frenzy during election times to search for these accounts. Obviously they were the ones to get a promotion.\n\n2. Illegal: RBI takes a data of every single cash transaction over Rs 10Lacs from every Bank. All Branches consolidate this report and send to RBI. RBI then asks the banks to get explanation from the customer on these transaction. Banks randomly out standard remarks like labor payments/daily wages/market expenses without even asking the customer. Because if you question the customer he will not be happy and change his account to another bank. So banks proactively gives false reporting to the RBI on these transactions. This RBI wings is pretty incompetent and doesnt even cross question, they probably wont even have time or resources to flag suspicious transaction and send to IT. \n\n3. Unethical:Accounts which is zero balance and hasnt been used in years, will be charged rs 750/- every quarter as non-maintenance charges. Banks have millions of account like this. This penalty amount can never be recovered from the customer. Someone who hasnt been using their account for months would rather open a new account instead of paying. But this penalty across all account will come upto like 50 crs which will shown as fee income. Fee income/profits are inflated every year to show fake growth. Also beg all your customer to increase their balances in their accounts during monthend/yearend and show high closing figures for 31st march, and dont reveal that all these balances are gone on 1st April.\n\n4. Unethical: Bank Audits both external and internal. The Bank employees would shit bricks a month in advance if an audit especially external audits is scheduled and rightly so. But most the auditors are super senior drunk with power autocratic but impractical and incompetent clowns. The way they walk and look demands respect and the bank manager would follow him like a hungry chihuahua every sec. Auditors fucking life of that attention and fear they generate. But unfortunately, they are too fucking focussed on just processes and paperwork that they lose the bigger picture. 'Oh you didnt take ID proof of non-customers for these cash withdrawals, thats few points less. Dont have acc opening forms for these 20 customers , you lose 30 pts'. Finally gives an A or B rating and fucks off. Doesnt see what are the bigger implication of these lapses and how serious real life frauds can be avoided.\n\n5. Unethical: God awful butt fucking sales pressure. Get money by hook or crook or fuck right off. The Bellary branch manager who's branch was found to have helped the illegal business in Bellary mining scam grew from Sr Manager to SVP in like 4 yrs. Bellary branch was the best performing branch in pretty much the entire country. What was the branch manager's penalty for flouting rules and helping launder money? Transfer to Bangalore and work out the headquarters in the regional role. A role which most people can only dream off and expect in like 10yrs. \n\nThese are just few things which come to mind. The sheer number of branches and bank makes it difficult to RBI or IT to monitor but doesnt excuse any bank of their ethical requirements."
'Something stinks here. This is approximately 2.5 crores per account and some/none of them were fully/partially KYC compliant.\n\n* Why would I as a branch manager allow this? I mean an idiot with a computer printout would flag these deposits and ask questions.\n\n* (putting on my tinfoil hat) Is this a conspiracy by some to prove that grey money (it is not black until it is proven to be black) indeed existed and the gormint is on its toes ?\n\n* Looking at it from depositor\'s pov. If I were to deposit such large amounts (avg. 2.5 crores) into my account I would have either filed appropriate income tax returns. Or I\'ve proof that some higher up in the gormint is fucking up big time (extra marital affair, murder, ...) making me untouchable.\n\n\nedit: Can an RTI be filed to figure what happens to these "raids"?\n\nedit: How long will a cash counting machine take to count 100 crores? Assume all of it in 1000 Rupee notes.'
"Great, no fine for Axis bank. Way to go GOI. Obviously it's not the bank's fault. It's just a select few employees. Absolutely no mistake by the bank. Nice."

"not the bankers, The bank chairman should be responsible. Why was he hiding the facts to public and share holders that his bank has 44 accounts with fake money deposited without linking to Adhar or ID or passport if NRI account. \n\nIf he claims that his computer bank software didn't catch and some employees are fooling the system and behind this then who are they ? Why didn't thos bank managers figured out ? Lets assume if bank managers of multiple axis banks are involved at same time, then why didn't AGM figured this out ? Lets assume if AGM is part of scam then why didn't DGM found the scam ? Lets say Everyone below the level of DGM are involved, then why GM for that district didn't identify that. Let us assume all 100 -120 staff members are involved why didn't inspection auditors didn't catch until scam grew to 100 crores ? So I will blame king pin chairman of the bank."
'Not a good idea to do anything till the ATM restrictions are lifted. Right now every bank branch is helping a common man somewhere or the other. The burden on other banks will be increased if the kill Axis right now. I agree with the general idea of suspending or revoking their license eventually'

">genpop is busy circlejerking about how evil and corrupt taxmen are.\n\nYeah lets not get carried away here.\n\nThis hatred isn't completely unfounded. The IT Dept. is full of people who actively try to harass taxpayers and naturally take bribes to make it all disappear. You are guilty until proven innocent, and this sort of nonsense is endemic to everything about India's rubbish bureaucratic system.\n\nThey can't even make a functional website for tax returns and the total dysfunction in the IT dept of the IT dept is immediately apparent to anyone.\n\nHere's a simple illustration of how dumb they are: In emails from the tax department that ask you to enter your password and DoB, the example they give: \n\n\n>For example, if your PAN is ABCDE1234A and date of birth /incorporation is January 1, 1985 then the password will be abcde1234a01011985\n\nWhen DoB is either DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY what kind of moron makes an example where DD and MM are the same ? Really basic shit like making spelling mistakes in emails, having emails go into spam. And worst of all - get your tax returns online ? Nope, no pdf available; shitty text file that's caret delimited. What kind of idiot thought this would be a good idea ?\n\nIt's no big surprise that people are sick of their shit and decide to just not declare all of their income."
'Hats off to your parents for keeping up with such shitty responses from media and doing what everyone must do!  '

The time they take for processing my tax return has also come down significantly.\n\n> what kind of moron makes an example where DD and MM are the same\n\nNo one in India uses MM/DD/YYYY.\n\n> And worst of all - get your tax returns online\n\nWhat are you talking about?

"I have a school mate in ITD. Corrupt as fuck, before raids, they secretly talk to the person being investigated and give them a figure. If the person agrees, they'll go to the raid after sometime (which means they wont find anything, accused is getting time to hide things), otherwise they'll immediately do the raid."
"It's trash compared to the rest of the world. Given that India proclaims itself as an IT superpower, having such an awful website for tax returns is quite pathetic.\n\n>No one in India uses MM/DD/YYYY\n\nAnd yet the example is still shit.\n\n>What are you talking about?

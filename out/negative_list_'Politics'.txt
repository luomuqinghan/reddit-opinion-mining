"That guy in the back.... He's pissed for some reason. "
'This pic makes happy and extremely sad at the same time. \n\nThis kid was lucky he was saved by the police. But what about other abducted kids in India? , hundreds of them get abducted everyday, and get forced into prostitution, slavery, begging, etc,  never to see their family again. Whenever I think about it, it makes me extremely sad. \n\nUnfortunately, no politician is serious about child trafficking issue. '
'Oh no, the /r/all crowd of racists is going to flood this heartwarming post. '
'So. damn. photogenic. '
'You thought I was a victim? I was just a kid napping!'
'Wants to know when the fucking cable guy is going to come back and fix the damn tv!  The wires! '
'This warms my heart. But I think the wedge between both the communities is deeper than we think.\n\nI am from a Hindu family and most of my relatives are islamophobic. My father who was a veterinarian is of the opinion that India should have been declared a Hindu country. Since he is the most educated person in his circle, people actually listen to him talk about these things. Worse yet, he is part of a group that goes around capturing photos of temples in South India. He blames the Islamic rulers for destroying temples. But the tone he uses when he talks about the persecution of Jains by Hindu kings blatantly shows his hypocrisy. \n\nI just told this so that some people can know that there are "educated" hypocrites out there and India has to deal with them.'
"I don't get it. You are a soldier. No religious text force you to do this everywhere at all costs. Why do this religious appeasement thing in such a crucial time? This indicates a weak point that the enemy can easily use against these officers. "
"And yet, the same person will often kill many a kashmiri muslims -\n cause of his duty and the other reason being - he does not know them. \n\nThat is the whole thing here. Almost any Hindu/Muslim will do the same for another Muslim/Hindu **whom they know**. \n\nOnly when the other person is someone whom we don't know - do things get out of hand. Even when someone is rioting, you will often see the rioting crowd go a certain distance and then get down to business (arson, lynching whatever). One of the reasons is to be the unknown face in another area, but the other reason is someone doing something bad to someone you know very well, is actually quite difficult. \n\nAs Guha says, you need the roti-beti rishta between ethnic groups for them to live harmoniously with each other. \n\nFor all the elite and iitiim- matrimonies dot coms.. I really wish someone came up with interreliginomatrimony.com where the spouses are necessarily from different religions...but alas in today's times - there is no money to be made there to be frank enough.\n\n"
"Why does CRPF weak Khaki Police uniform.\n\nThats why most people can not distinguish between CRPF  and the Civil Police (when they're in Khakis) and from the Army (when they are in camouflage)."
"A that an FN Fal?? He'll never get a kill streak with that f'ing fail of a gun. "
'We could learn from this shit right here '
'What gun is he holding?'
'This is what RSS and BJP hates. They want every Hindu to hate Muslims just like how Muslim bigots want every Muslim to hate Hindu. '
'People should not glorify worship. It is devotion to the biggest scam perpetrated on humanity. You would not hold up an Amway proponent in the same regard. '
'So ? \n\nI am serious, why is it such a big deal ? '
'I am confused, are we supposed to hate kashmiris and muslims or not? '
"These normal things are getting lost in a haze of hatred in the name of nationalism or politics or whatever it is. People are starting to think that the twitter psychos represent the 'normal' India."
'Tell that to the Kashmiri Muslim officer who got killed while attending a wedding and no one in Kashmir batted an eye. \n\nNo protests. Nothing. '
"Exactly. It's such a shame that we've come to a state where such images don't seem normal to our eyes anymore."
'No ! A normal person should have enough logical thinking to know that religion is BS.'
"blah blah blah it's those muzlamics "
'Let\'s say you believe in an *extremely* powerful, all-present force which can protect you from harm, empower you, smite your enemies, and all of this stuff. He likes that you face a certain direction and do some stuff. If you seriously believed this, why *wouldn\'t* you do it regardless of the time?\n\n\nWe\'ve got so many people where I live who are supposedly terrified of going to Hell, but the way they act tells me they\'re more afraid of being late for work or acting up on the job and losing it than they are *an eternity of fiery torment*. The fair-weather religious; I\'ll be "Godly" when it\'s something as simple as saying gays shouldn\'t get married, but not when my beliefs run counter to something I kinda wanna do, like cheat on my wife or eat shellfish.'
"People do all kinds of shit I don't understand regardless of religion."
"> the same person will often kill many a kashmiri muslims\n\nYes, when they start to throw stones at him at attack his personal space, he'll defend himself. And that is supposed to be a bad thing how?"
'I used to throw chocolate and chip wrappers on the street till I was in 11th, one day saw a foreign tourist  pick up a chip packet thrown by a desi man and throw it in the bin. Got soo embarrassed, it hurt hard.'
'The problem with such campaigns is that they tell people to NOT do something. Like "Don\'t urinate on streets", "Don\'t litter" etc.  \n\nThe focus should instead be more on having and maintaining enough garbage disposal places. Tell people to "Use dustbins" and "Use Urinals" and allocate budget on keeping them usable.'
"It's shocking and sad to see how many educated people do this ..."
'We should learn a lot from North East which gets Exposure in media only for those military activities and not for other good deeds. '
"Saw a lot of this or variations there of during my recent trip to Meghalaya. Some of the few places that are still pristine. Saw a lot of tourists try  to throw their plastic bottles off the waterfalls' edges. Also found Rajnigandha packets inside Cherrapunji caves. That was just incredibly awful as you have to go in barefooted."
"Living in New Delhi. People who live in New Delhi are very disgusting and everyone is in so much attitude. They throw wrapper literally 2-3 feet away from the bin. And when you say someone not to throw it they start fighting (physically fight). So, this is disgusting. \n\n\nI really don't know how to handle this and where to complained about these people. "
'Stumbled to this sub from Canada, surreal to see the culture differences. Even suggesting a class system exists between educated and uneducated people would cause a lot of outrage here.'
"If everyone stops throwing trash on the streets, wouldn't those municipal employees lose their jobs?  \nHow would they feed their children?  \nAs a domino effect, 99.5% of our population would be left in the streets.  \n\nWouldn't it lead to massive unemployment, abject poverty, skyrocketing\u200b crime, irrecoverable illiteracy, extreme lawlessness and total hopelessness ?   "
'Sick ass burn, man. Would really make a person feel bad for littering /s'
'Because cities are giant dumps in the first place. '
'It is to show those uneducated poor fucks that we can throw shit and they have to pick it up.'
'The problem with us is we want first want others to change.\n\nDo the needful and all of the rest will flow.'
"This sign can't be in America. No one's picking up the garbage from what I can see."
"I have picked up other people's wrapers, empty water bottles in Delhi metro and see them tear up in humiliation."
'Legitimate question, how does trash pickup work in India? Is there a trash day where you leave your crap outside and the guy picks it up? \n\nOn my street there is a dumpster that is 100% of the time overflowed with garbage spilling out into the street. It stinks so bad. This is the case all the time whenever I go visit'
"I never threw anything in public after taking an oath at school on Gandhi jayanti. I was in 5th I guess.\n\nI never told anyone about it. I think it's kind of weird 🙄\n"
'The entire country is a giant garbage dump'
"So we're low key calling garbage workers stupid...."
'630 million people just shit where ever they want, every day, in that god forsaken country. '
'What is the point of life? You are going to die in a 100 years.'
'My mother drilled it into my head by practice and preaching that waste goes **only** into the (correct) dustbin. We even used to have segregated waste at home since I was I think in the 2nd standard. Even when I was alone, I could never bring myself to throw something on the street. '
"That's empathy. Get rid of it asap. It continues to hit harder no matter what you do."
'why poop in the street when you could just shit your pants'
"Does it ever occurr to you that education is actually a privilege? Countless people haven't got it yet, for hell lot of different reasons. Not everything is solvable by investing more money."
'nothing. And while we are at it. So we should have more educated people than us to do our dirty work, according to this poster. '
'I think it might be saying that it\'s useless to be educated if you\'re going to litter, because littering makes you just as uneducated as the uneducated person who is going to pick it up. \n\nYour "educated" ass litters the streets, yet it\'s the people we see as "uneducated" and look down upon who pick it up. '
"Damn someone gilded this 3 times. I'm not even the cosplay girl. I didn't do anything. I just saw this on Twitter and posted here. "
'Kulcha warriors are confused AF.'
"she doesn't look like Indian wonder woman, she is looking more of a seductress rather than a superheroine"
'_Indian version of Wonder Woman._\n\nHow the hell she will fight with so much jewellery; or she is fighting only with husband?'
'This attracted lot of hate and racist comments on r/pic. '
"Seeing Gal, I don't like her duppata and jewelery. Albeit that's what making the look Indian"
"She looks beautiful.\n\nBut, she also looks nothing like how a warrior should be like. She can't fight in that dress. Too many loose knots to pull her out of her posture. \n\nA cosplay is supposed to be accurate as the character. This isn't. This cannot be termed as a cosplay, just a girl dressed up in clothes like Wonder Women."
'I know a Zawar, which kind of sounds like fucker in Marathi.'
'Damn how come there’s no Indian women like this where I live??'
'that costume looks worn out'
'low effort from her, she is being too kanjoos even with all the money she making with those makeup videos, crowdfund her a costume, that lower half looks like a rag'
'Indian my ass'
'One girl was named Siddha Lodha.\n\nHer parents were either retarded or massive assholes for naming her that'
'Coming here from /all... why would that last name be bad? Doesn’t sound like any of my bad words '
'What is the bad word there (that it sounds like)?'
"Nope. Saree represents cape.\n\nI know wonder woman doesn't wears a cape. But the saree as cape on her looks rad as fuck. Whoever designed this deserver a serious applaud. "

Without the comic license, I would call this a back handed compliment; a juvenile/rudimentary take.

The NYT is making fun of India, saying that India has no business being concerned with space exploration at all.\n\n\n> also it mocks at the elitism of west and upholds the frugality of Indian space program. \n\nThe NYT was definitely not trying to praise the frugally of the Indian space program with that cartoon. They are trying to say, "well, FINE, you may have reached outer space, but you\'re stupid dirty cow-worshippers, so we\'re still better than you". \n\nYou have to look at the cartoon through a Western perspective. It kills them to have to report on India actually achieving something good, so they use the opportunity to talk about how "it doesn\'t matter, because Indians are still inferior anyway." '
'It also doesnt help how touchy and thin skinned we are. Who remembers that NYT cartoon except Indians? Even the cartoonist probably doesnt remember. Yet we rankle and remember for years, and this very thread is full of comments indicating that. '

'>I don\'t condone senseless violence especially when directed at innocents and I also don\'t condone a leader whose primary goals are to build wealth, power and feed his own ego. However, I will say that we shouldn\'t just write-off all his followers. Instead we should look into why he has amassed so many followers and why they feel so attached to him.\n\n>I\'m not sure how many of us Sikhs in the West are aware but a huge amount of Dera Sacha Saudas (DSS from now on) followers are low/out caste, down-trodden and mired by poverty. DSS specifically targets these oppressed people and provides them with uplifting hope. This can be seen in Gurmeet Ram Rahim\'s movies, one of which shows him taking a prostitute who is rejected by society, accepting her as a daughter and helping her get married. He welcomes the transgenders, the homosexuals (who he helps to "fix") and former criminals. He gives them hope; "you can be loved too and be a valued part of society." His lower-castes and downtrodden followers feel a sense of belonging and feel valued and equal to others. This gives them the precious gift of self-respect and confidence. And who do they have to thank for this new found strength? DSS. So, these followers become fanatically loyal to their uplifter. An attack on him is an attack on them.\n\n>It is well known that what DSS (or any other Radha Soami Beas group, for that matter) teaches and does is to be found in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Instead of being upset about Gurmeet Ram Rahim imitating the Guru and basically recycling the Guru\'s philosophy to his own ends we should ask ourselves why have Sikhs failed to reach these people? I will only answer the question with more questions. Why are there separate Gurdwaras for the Shudra and Dalit castes? Why are they looked down upon, rejected and thought of as unfit to share the leadership of the Dharam? Why do Jatts from Sikh families specifically target Dalit girls for sexual assault and rape? I think the answer is obvious to us all.\n\n>Clearly, Sikhs have failed to include the lower caste in their universal brotherhood. Sikhi has become the religion of Jatts, Khatris and mercantile castes. The spread of the religion has stagnated to just these castes specifically their Jatis (sub-castes) of Punjabi origins. These castes have come to believe that Sikhi belongs to them and is only for them. The lower castes are set aside as unworthy. So, instead of being angry at opportunists who step in to fill the vacuum we should look at why we are so compliant in letting the vacuum exist.'

Now use your imagination - say you are unprepared to deal with these things and the people around you are as unprepared too also what kind of outcomes do you think happen? Religion has existed and dogma has existed because people have problems they don't know how to deal with. Religion will continue to exist as long as we don't have good develop good answers to the abv problems. Because religion or blind faith at its core is about tomorrow will be a better day Han in there. There are characters who take advantage of that message in every religion for their own gains. By all means rant about that. But don't accuse your parents of running around searching for things to blindly believe in. If you dig deeper its usually because there is a problem they don't know how to solve."

"I don't think they were ignored - my understanding is that there were no Indian combat units there... only support units? Can that be verified? "
'I\'m not sure how the Germans thought of the Indians as a race. There was the Indian Legion, a unit comprised of POWs who chose to fight for the Wehrmacht and were trained as a standard German unit with the same doctrine, uniform (with specially designed badge), weapons and extraordinarily the same pay and benefits as German troops.\n\nThis was probably due to political necessity though, with the end goal of a German invasion of British held India. Hitler did comment that the Indian Legion was "a joke" and that the resources due to go to the Legion should be given to the Horst Wessel division instead.\n\nAfter the Allied invasion of France (where the Legion was stationed, as well as the Netherlands), the unit was ordered to Germany and did not fight for the Axis during the war.'
'No. North Indians are technically aryans and Hitler took a lot of symbolism from them, including the swastika. The Indians fought for the brits.'
'I kinda found it "meh". The humanist aspect is very well done but I was disappointed since there was no grand scope to the whole film. It felt very scattered.'

"Let them be triggered. In fact let us all be triggered. Many people don't even know the contribution of Indian subcontinent in major world events before 1947. And posts like this help us to learn more about our history.\n\n>Britain did not fight the second world war, the British empire did.\n\n Most people believe that WW2 was a war fought in Europe and Japan. Rarely anyone knows the battles fought in North East India. Or the rations sent to Britain to support the war, creating massive famines, even with good monsoon and harvest, killing millions. Look up Bengal Famine. The list goes on, and i don't want this to sound like a rant, so i'll stop. The worst part is, none of this included in our education system. \n\nSo, better let people be triggered. At least they will learn some history."
"This is a bit frustrating, while you would be ignorant of British history to say that White Brits conquered the world by themselves, Sepoys fighting in the Opium Wars for example. Dunkirk was pretty much exclusively white. I did some research and there was a single Indian Company (from the whole of India) in Dunkirk in 1940. A British company consists of 3 platoons, or about 80-150 men. By the 8th day of the evacuation of Dunkirk, 338,226 men had been brought across the channel. Meaning that ~.0004% of the forces at Dunkirk were Indian. It would be more revisionist to focus on the non-white forces just really to make sure they're represented when it was such a tiny portion of the total forces. Nolan also does not focus on all the Canadian, Dutch, French, and Polish that were evacuated because the focuses on the Brits that were evacuated.\n \nhttps://www.sikhdharma.org/the-story-of-the-sikhs-during-two-world-wars/"

'Not sure you understand what I mean by the word "narrative".'
"Hardly a war movie, imo. It's really more of a suspense thriller set to the backdrop of a war. "
"You can't demand from a filmmaker. If you are outraged, make your own movie. Nolan made a movie not a history book."
"Yes, it's unreasonable. In a movie about something as big as WWII, there will always be someone who'll get left out. Hell, the British were crying about the movie overlooking Churchill.\n\nThis was a commercial film about British bravery. Why do you expect them to show a part of history that doesn't work with the rest of the story and in fact undermines it?\n\nAlso, crying about it now won't make a difference. So, stop begging Hollywood to acknowledge you."
'Holy shit that was a  fucking insane read.'
'Another reason why I think Gandhi\'s BS philosophy of nonviolence didn\'t do shit. \n\nWhenever I compare the Indian war of Independence with the American war of independence I am amazed at the differences.\n\nThe founding fathers got together on July 4, 1776 and basically said, "Fuck off Britain, we are independent from this day forth and now we will work to kick you out of OUR country"\n\nGandhi\'s approach to independence was "I will sit around on my ass not doing anything until our british lords and the lords of this country give this country to us to rule" then he heard the crys for "Purna Swaraj" from others like Bhagat Singh et al. and said, "Oh yea, throw in that thing too"\n\nAs such, the Indian Independence Day is August 15, 1947 the day the Brits gave it to us, and not May 10, 1857 when we first started a revolt that amounted to zilch.\n'
'My bad. Was north western, but technically northern should suffice.'
">Also, crying about it now won't make a difference. So, stop begging Hollywood to acknowledge you.\n\nIts not about acknowledgement, its about an accurate portrayal of events. If there were a token *Indian guy* and a token *French guy* Nolan would still be criticized. However, its not a documentary therefore Nolan is entirely in the clear how selective he is of actual events. "

'Convoys follow protocols.\n\nIf a traffic policeman two junctions ahead reports a blockage, the driver won\'t go "tu jaanta nahi mera passenger kaun hai".\n\nI expect that the convoy\'s training/protocol fully covers such situations, and if you were to report an emergency vehicle to their coordinator, they\'d readily cooperate. Probably what happens more often is that the local cops get scared at the thought of stopping the PM/Prez for some third grade citizen.'

Muslim neighborhoods are relatively cleaner than Hindu ones. Hindus especially upper caste seem to have an aversion to cleanliness ie don't clean up after themselves. I had an aunt who used to rent the building, after a while she decided not to rent to Hindu families anymore because they weren't taking up social contracts and tend to have poor hygiene habits."
'The Indus valley civilization predated the caste system in India. Back then human waste disposal was done by everyone. \n\n The arrival of the "Varna" system and the categorization/specialization  of community roles led to the process of scavenging being assigned to the Dalits(Untouchable) communities.  So other communities stopped planning for any waste disposal mechanisms (the dalits would clean them anyway, so why bother) like the Indus valley people needed to . \n\nThere is a direct correlation between the varna system solidifying and the rise of the open defecation culture in India.

"Grandparent poster's comment contains too many variables. I have seen rest stops in the US that are absolutely disgusting, and Indian airport toilets that are absolutely disgusting too (some domestic sections at the Pune airport, for example).\n\nOn an average, I think they are about the same, i.e. avg.

Secondly, his Top Dog, [**Amit the don Shah, who has links with such GauRakshashas!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag27L23o5yE)\n\nSo we need action against such people, his own partymen.

This is a big problem in big cities as the problem multiplies because of the population.\n\nSome companies have become quite responsible. The place where I work there is a decent waste management. Waste good which amounts to tonnes is decomposed and the gas fills up the balloons which is used to supply the gas to the kitchens. Waste office paper is recycled in house and is used to provide company stationary. Also some of the toilet water is treated and is provided to plants and to maintain the lawns.

I might have missed 10 trains before I realized that I am better off taking the train in opposite direction (to Borivali, the next station) which was relatively less crowded. The same train turns back from Borivali. Many people do that, but it was a TIL for me. I was three hours late. \n\nOnce I nearly got pushed out of the moving train.\n\nMy fear and hatred for local trains was so much that during my first year of working I spent 30% of my salary on taxis although I was living right next to a station. "
"My first stay in Mumbai during internship was of two months (leaving aside touristy visits). \n\nAt the end of the two months, I was sick, depressed (not clinically) and frustrated. Swore never to come back. Daily commute to office required a long walk, train and a bus and 1.5-2 hour each way. \n\nBut fate bought me back here. But second time I was smart. I took a place near my office although it was worse than a chawl. Getting commute right is 80% of the the thing in Mumbai. \n\nI don't get it why people buy homes far away from their place of work. The amenities of garden and pool aren't worth it if one stays an hour and a half away. Have tried to convince few friends to buy something closer even if it's smaller, older and without a big club house but they didn't listen to their regret. "

'Conventionally triple talaq is given one by one in a period of 3 months. If the couple cannot reconcile within this period then the third talaq is final and the couple is divorced.\n\nBut long ago, one time a group of women came to a Muslim ruler and said they wanted a divorce from their husbands and they could not stand living with the guy another day let alone three months. The ruler called the husbands who also said they could not stand living with the women another day.\n\nSo to fast track this process the ruler asked the husbands to say talaq thrice immediately on the same day and finalize the divorce. Looking at their example more and more people started going to the ruler to ask permission for triple talaq on the same day instead of prolonging for 3 months and thus some communities adopted this approach.\n\nToady most Muslim communities have outlawed this practice and called it wrong while some communities still cling to it just for the sake of tradition.\n\nEven the Muslim personal law board in India cannot prove from Quran or Hadith that saying 3 talaq on the same day is acceptable in Islam, they do it just because that is how they were taught to do it by their fathers and forefathers.

Thus, struck down.\n\nJ Joseph said it's not covered by 1937 Act but question remains if triple talaq is 'essential' part of Islam. He held it's not. Thus, struck down. Where does this practices-essential-to-religion doctrine come from? A massive brain fart. \n\nI don't understand what the fuck J Keher and J Nazer were upto. Tatti dissent. \n\nIrrespective, if it weren't for technicalities like the 1937 Act or Joseph's interpretation of Quran, triple talaq would be legally untouchable. Because, uncodified (i.e. laws not passed by Parliament) personal laws are not subject to constitutional principles and safeguards, even in 2017."

'Yup, i thought that triple talaq will be banned, when they build a temple in ayodhya. '
"It's the legislature's job to make laws. It's a pathetic state of affairs how the SC had to prod the Govt to legislate on this. Can't call them pussies; if they started legislating we would no longer be a democracy. "
"Interesting, the political implications of this.\n\nBasically it is banned, but the BJP has the opportunity to bring it to parliament and make the opposition parties face a difficult choice.

If they choose to oppose the ban, they'll jeopardize their standing as liberal and progressive.\n\nBut now they'll be forced to take a position.

"It is a good verdict and tbh a long awaited one. But looking into statistics triple talaq just affects not even 0.1% of the muslims. \n\nThis was a whole political game and low fruit hanging. I think the Govt should now think seriously about repealing 377. They will not do it because it will be a political suicide for them. RSS will not accept it, Muslims and Christians will not accept it. \n\nGovt doesn't care about the rights of the individuals if it doesn't fall under the vote bank. If anyone thinks that govt is for the rights of the muslim women then they are just delusional. "
"To add to this, triple talaq doesn't even go hand in hand with the practice of Iddah (now if someone tells me that Iddah is no longer relevant, cuz you can have a medical test for pregnancy - then I'll tell them that neither is polygamy because the sex ratio is opp to what was when it was allowed, women have independent lives without marrying in the 21st century and no wars leading to widows..)\n\nWhile I'm not saying that if a practice is Islamic it should be left untouched, triple talaq is neither Islamic nor logical and hence had to go away\n\n"

"No but the petitioners said that the practice is against Islam itself. Their whole argument is that they are being discriminated against by an un-Islamic practice, not the actual Islamic 'law'. I doubt it makes them any less Muslim."
'Why people upvoting this communalist bigot when a simple google or wiki would disprove him.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam#Talaq_al-bid.27ah_and_triple_talaq\n\n>In contrast to talaq al-sunnah, talaq al-bid\'ah does not observe the waiting period and irrevocably terminates the marriage.[17] It may involve a "triple talaq", i.e., the declaration of talaq repeated three times, or a different formula such as "you are haram for me".[17][19] Some legal schools held that a triple talaq performed in a single meeting constituted a "major" divorce, while others classified it as a "minor" divorce.[5] Talaq al-bid\'ah reflects pre-Islamic divorce customs rather than Quranic principles, and it is considered to be a particularly disapproved, though legally valid form of divorce in traditional Sunni jurisprudence.[17] According to Islamic tradition, Muhammad denounced the practice of triple talaq, and the second caliph Umar punished husbands who made use of it.[19]\n\nFar from Triple talaq being mandatory in Islam, Its the opposite, Triple talaq is likely( unlike this guy i wouldn\'t state it unequivocally) illegal  under Islam, which is why even muslim countries like Pakistan banned it.'

If fairness creams are racist then so is hair color. It’s a personal choice! #NotRacist"*  \n \nproducts of nepotism (╥﹏╥)'
'political correctness is dead. ~~ susu swamy'
"> no one is saying people should not have the choice to lighten their skin\n\nDevil's advocate, why should they have that choice? Fairness creams(even if they worked, which they don't) enable and buy into a racist world view that fairer is better. \n\nI find it hard to reconcile that with a situation in which they *don't* demean darker people. I mean, how are you going to sell fairness products otherwise? You *have* to say that fairer is better, otherwise nobody is going to buy your product. That's how marketing works.\n\nI say ban it.\n"
'To faking concerns on social issues.'
'It depends. Regualr application of some will make you fairer, but at most it will only take you to your natural fairer color (like the color of your scalp).

Blueberries have a Hydroquinone substitute, which can make your skin lighter.'

'As a culture, we need to make it clear to the next generation that fairer skin is not inherently better than darker skin. Fairer = better is deeply rooted in our culture. All of these ads only propagate these backward ideas further.'
"Disagree. It's inherent in the nature of marketing/capitalism to push your products as hard as possible. That delicate line you advocate won't be adhered to. Also, fairness creams in general pander to a racial inferiority complex. They should get banned. It's especially damaging to women."

'Why do Supreme Court judges waste time in writing utterly useless and irrelevant crap that a 15 year old with a dictionary can write in their judgments? I mean what purpose does this monstrosity even serve?\n\nIn doing this they not only waste their own time doing this, they waste the times of countless lawyers, judges and law students who have to filter through this nonsense to find the actual legal arguments of the case.\n\nEdit: The even larger problem I think these sorts of sentences expose is the "God complex" that the Supreme Court in particular is suffering from. All of these things need to be written because they want to establish huge demons that our society is facing. Why you ask? Because you see, demons requires Gods to slay them, and SC wants to position itself in the place of that God in Indian society.\n\nThe narrative is, these are times of extraordinary evil, and extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures and these circumstances require SC to position itself as God, that is, take up extra powers that constitution doesn\'t grant them in order to slay the demons around us. And make no mistake, this is not a narrative that they are trying to build to delude other people – most people already don\'t know shit about separation of powers and will mostly just believe whatever SC says about law – it is for the purpose of deluding *themselves*. They need to justify their actions to *themselves*, because *they* know where the law is. This sort of deliberate self-delusion is btw a technique all grand institutions use in search for power.'

'Holy alliteration! Malignant Malaise - seriously? If the alliterations were cut out, the message would not change and it would read much less pompous. \n\nAnother point is that the sentences are too long. Each sentence must have one single messages. The judge is stringing together multiple messages separated by commas, making it even more difficult to read.'
'Pretty sure months would have been wasted drafting this shit... Now we know why cases drag on fir ages. Think judiciary is infact the one primarily responsible for corruption.

Verbose, yes but makes sense.\n\nThe point being made is that corruption is such a huge problem that right thinking people must use every and any chance to chastise and correct such a problem.\n\nWhy? Because constant and repeated public acknowledgement of the fact that corruption is punished is the only thing that will save us in the end from falling off from the point of no return. Case in point: Pakistan where people have made peace with the fact that they have nothing to protect them from corruption by those in public life."

"Story behind the pic: http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/story-behind-viral-photo-andhra-cop-folding-hands-family-69760\n\n>What prompted Shubh Kumar into this expression was the frustration and helplessness of seeing such a gross traffic violation before him right after he had finished an hour and a half-long session on road safety and how not adhering to traffic safety rules could have consequences for one’s family.\n\n>“It was frustrating, knowing that we put so much effort into creating an awareness and yet people pay no heed to it at all. While I was frustrated, I couldn’t scold or shout at him. I didn’t want to make police evil in the minds of his children, given that the police are already seen by some as harassers of the public,” Shubh Kumar told TNM. \n\n>“I somehow had to convey that what he did was wrong! His children were sitting on the petrol tank, there was no chance of maneuvering the vehicle. It was so dangerous! He had put the lives of his wife and children at such danger. So, my immediate reaction was to fold hands and humbly request him to follow road safety,” Shubh Kumar says.\n\n>Shubh Kumar says that he didn't fine the family, and also went the extra mile to ensure their safety when he found out that Hanumantharayudu didn’t have his driving license.\n\n>“I was really annoyed,” Shubh Kumar admits, “But they had told us that they were going to a temple. So, didn’t want to ruin their day. I hired an auto rickshaw and sent his wife and children to the temple in that. I didn’t even fine him for the traffic violation.”"

Maneka Sanjay Gandhi held a one-on-one interaction with people through a Live Facebook Chat on June 29, 2017. The activity reached out to nearly 2,00,000 people, with over 700 questions received.\n \n>During the course of the interaction, a Facebook users posted the question, “Q. What our Govt is doing to reduce higher suicide rate among men, majority of which is due to Gynocentric Gender-Biased laws.?”. To this the Hon’ble Minister responded, “Which men have committed suicide ??? Why not try and resolve the situation rather than commit suicide – I have not heard/read of a single case.” However, media reports have misconstrued the statement and missed the context of the question. **The question was in the context of suicides committed due to the supposed gender-biased laws.** However, the response of the Minister is unfortunately being judged in isolation and taken out of context. The Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Minister have constantly advocated for equal rights of all citizens of the nation.\n\nThe answer by the minister is still stupid but the shoddy journalism here outshines it.

"Using cards for the microtransaction sounds like inefficient way. Don't they have to pay a ~7K for the POS machine, 3+2% for each transaction?

The offline authentication method of freecharge is less time consuming that than others.\n\nUsing the card for the microtransactions are more of inconvenience for me.

Those freaking creatures converted his account to CLASSIC account @ 125/year where you'll get priority services such as dedicated manager because there was about 2lakh in the account for some time.\n\nNow few days ago that manager called to give some platinum debit card, she has no clue that he's no more. His phone is with me so whenever someone calls if they as for my dad I say yes.. and they goes on.\n\nNow after few minutes she says how I can get that debit card and if I need anything I can call her, then she went to his credit card at this point I said dad is no more, my mom uses that account and I help her, after that she said sir if you'll open an account you'll get priority services!! I said okay I'll think later..\n\nThat classic account has 0 balance, yeah FUCKING ZERO RUPPES LYING THERE!  She had no idea, she thought if it's a classic account then there must be >2lakh!\n\nand weird thing: after last installment fully paid they called me this month saying they have a cheque there and I need to keep necessary balance to get it passed. I told her what cheque? Last cheque is already cleared and there shouldn't be any cheque! She waits a sec and says okay lemme call with manager and will call back in 30mins. She never called me again.\n\nPs: I was tired of saying my dad is death so whenever someone calls from bank and ask for him I say: Yes I'm speaking (from heaven?)

"Sometimes with some customer service, you have to exert yourself that you're not dropping it and they need to address the issue.\n\nI bought an item off eBay from a hacked account and after the 10 day wait to get my money back, eBay told me it was a Paypal issue and to call them.\n\nI called Paypal and told them everything about the charge and they said eBay has to take care of it since there was a dispute opened on eBay.\n\nAlright, I called eBay back about the problem with buying an item on the hacked account and they said that Paypal handles the refunds after the dispute is resolved so I'd need to get a hold of them and have them reverse the charges.\n\nKnowing full well that they were going to keep this shit up until I gave up and just accepted the loss, I asked to speak with a supervisor who told me they would have the matter resolved by the end of the day.\n\nThe following day, nothing was done and when I called eBay up to check the status, they said it wasn't started yet.  I asked to speak with a supervisor who said the same thing to me and I argued that it's the same shit the guy told me yesterday.\n\nEvery hour after that I called and checked the status of the refund.  I asked to speak with a salaried supervisor after the person on the phone tried to tell me to call Paypal and this went on for 2 days.\n\nLiterally took over 24 calls in a 2 day period to them to actually reverse the charges when every person I spoke to said to call Paypal prior to speaking with a supervisor.\n\nReading online about it, many people just got frustrated to the point where they gave up and forfeited their money but I wasn't going to just give $100 up because they wanted to con me like the person with the hacked account.\n\nAnymore now, I do not pay for items until 24 hours have passed.

'>A horde of them attack one elephant and even that takes a lot of effort \n\nWhere did you get that? Tigers are solitary animals and not hunt in groups unlike Lions.'
"Yeah it is but their habitat is substantially decreasing. As a result more tigers are in direct contact with humans - thus resulting in conflict. Also doesn't help that ~40% of India's tiger population is outside of PAs. "
"What about the Tamil tigers? They don't like Sanskrit imposition. "
"Yup, but there's no dearth of poachers. Also with a huge population you have multiple interactions between the populace and the wild life, which doesn't end very well for them."

'Okay, how about this...According to www.tigersofindia.com, tigers, in low vegetation areas, will sometimes cooperate to take down larger prey.

'Not really Venice if you want to spend the night on a houseboat with cockroaches. \n\nIt unfortunately has become way too touristy and lot less beautiful in experience than depicted in the picture from a DJI Phantom drone with a GoPro or similar. "God\'s Own Country" is succumbing to overall population & tourist visit growth and our general lack of attention to water pollution. Heck, most tourists lack personal hygiene or consideration of fellow travellers/others in the vicinity, Indian or otherwise. They do help local economy by allowing you to purchase local produce (like Tiger Prawns from a partner fisherman, for example), but nothing stops the locals themselves from polluting the waterways or paying attention to detail on their own boat. It is a horrible state of affairs given travel agents and aggregator websites market this location heavily for it\'s uniqueness. This will be a choc-o-block, heavily polluted and non-inviting experience very soon if not already. It is just sleeping in a boat house with a loud diesel motor running to power your AC if you are planning on doing one. I\'d rather that they ban overnight stays so we can save the waterways and the diesel and focus on regulated licenses so there are boats that take tourists on a ride akin to Malaysia where you do boat trips for "sea jacuzzi\'s" instead of anchoring and ruining the sea or in this instance a more vulnerable canal that worked for so long.

Racism is so prevalent in our country, that its sickening and disheartening.'

"Dude suicide's a legitimate option for severely depressed folk, whatever your moral qualms about it. I get that you can't understand the demons people with mental illnesses have to live through, but shit like this is why there isn't any real discourse in the world about mental illnesses and how serious they are. Cause shits like you shut the conversation down before it's even started with your 'I hate you cause you weren't strong enough to live with your suffering'. Would you say the same shit to farmers who commit mass suicide rather than starve to death, or terminally ill patients who ask for euthanasia? Do you have to see the actual illness to empathise with someone?\n"
"> it's not okay to kill yourself however sad your life gets\n\nOh fuck off, you're no one to judge. I'd say more, but this quote does a better job getting the point across than my words ever will.\n\n> “The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”"
"It's really not about the truth but more about not understanding why they make the music they do and then mocking the band on the day the lead singer killed himself.

"Exactly right. They're called invisible illnesses for a reason. "
"ARE YOU JUSTIFYING A SUICIDE ? \nYeah it's difficult to judge and I'm not even judging or analyzing. \n\nBut no problem or situation in this life is worse enough to justify suicide !

No, Chester is in no way related to those farmers.

I\'m not saying that Chester was a fucktard weakling to commit suicide ! \nI\'m not saying that he had no issues and life was a bliss ! \nAll I\'m trying to do is shed light on the fact that suicide is not the answer to all the world\'s problems one might have ! \nThere are many people who have troubles in their life and most of them are not mentally strong enough to cope with them even though there are solutions to their problems. These people get "inspiration" from these acts !\n\nIf you can\'t hear an opinion which doesn\'t suit you, don\'t shit there ! Now get the fuck out of here'

"I suppose I'm an actual cunt fuck then, aren't I? There have been more than enough times in my life where my mental list of pros and cons of suicide and continuing to live ended up with suicide being the better option. I didn't go through with it cause it wouldn't have been the best option for my family, but it sure as shit is is still the best option for me. You may think otherwise, but as long as its about me or anyone that isn't you, it really doesn't matter. \n\nActually its a lot more closer than you think. Both the farmers and chester lost to demon too big to overcome for them. The demons might be different but the struggle between wanting to live and the desire to end their suffering is the same.\n\nYes I am, a lot of the times suicide is a rational decision which people have been considering for years and decades. The fact that you want discussion about that shut down is the kind of shit that makes that consideration internal which majes it impossible for these people to get help.\n\nOh for fuck's sake, tell me why suicide isn't the answer? There was a brilliant louis ck bit about this, and he was essentially right. If I'm worried about going to work tomorrow, how is that still a problem for me if I've killed myself? Worried about paying the bills? Nope, can't make me now that I'm dead! What other fucking option gives you as great as opportunity to be rid of life's shitty problems? Btw you know what's ironic, that snl skit helped me much more than some anti-conversation shit like you ever could.\n\nIf someone gets inspiration from chester committing suicide, that's on them not him. We should use this opportunity to start a conversation about how dangerously ignored mental illnesses are rather than whining about how someone losing to them is hurting our fee-fees."

"There's always that one guy who ruins everything"
"I don't think anyone's happy here that chester bennington killed himself. If you've seen a comment like that please link it. \n\nAlso, it's a little more emotive than 'sad and stuff', it's tragic, and at times like these there are different ways to do things. Once acknowledging what happened and remembering what you loved about chester(the music) which is what most people here are doing, the other moving the conversation to something negative.\n\nAlso, if you wanna counter whatever message you think chester sent with the act of killing himself( I'm sure that wasn't his intention) make better points buddy. Plenty of musicians kill themselves cause music attracts depressed people a lot(or creative people who are generally more prone to mental illnesses). \n\nIf you want to prevent suicide, raise awareness about the root of the problem, which is why he killed himself rather than blaming the victim for not being strong enough. Would you also blame a cancer patient for not being able to fight off cancer? Would you have acted less irrationally against this if he was suffering from something that wasnt a mental illness? \n\nI'd suggest instead of telling people suicide isn't the answer, try to understand what they're going through and help them so suicide isn't as tempting a choice to them. I can assure you that'll work a lot better than whatever you've been doing here. "

'The data collection method is extremely biased and cannot reflect reality. There may be more of these attacks *or* less of these attacks but any analysis based on this data is completely wrong. The data as presented is doing more harm than good. \n\n> Muslims were the target of 51% of violence centred on bovine issues over nearly eight years (2010 to 2017) and comprised 86% of 28 Indians killed in 63 incidents, according to an IndiaSpend content analysis of the English media.\n\n28 deaths in 63 incidents in over 8 years is *statistically* insignificant in a hugely populated country like ours. For comparison, [an average of eight people were killed daily on railway tracks in 2016](http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crossing-tracks-led-to-1-798-of-3-202-train-fatalities-in-mumbai-in-2016/story-rGyKVyTRkn9VqiIqjw6CYI.html). \n\n\n\n>To compile the list of attacks centred on cow-related issues over the past eight years, we ran Google searches with keywords that included, ‘cow vigilantes’, ‘gau-rakshaks’, ‘beef’, ‘lynching’, ‘cow slaughter’, ‘cattle thieves’, beef smuggler’ and ‘cattle trader’. Where information was incomplete, we spoke to the journalists who filed the original reports.\nMuslim victims were identified by name. In 8% of the 63 cases, the reports explicitly stated that those attacked were Dalits, who are also targets because many among them clear cow carcasses, skin them and eat beef. In a few cases, religion was difficult to determine.\nIn 50.8% (32) of the cases, the targets were Muslim, in 7.9% (5) Dalit, 4.8% (3) Sikh or Hindu (names appeared Sikh, but it wasn’t certain) and 1.6% (one) Christian; in 20.6% (13) cases, religion was not reported. Among 14.3% (9) cases, the targets were Hindus, but their caste was not clear.\nPolice officers and onlookers were injured in 8% (5) of the attacks; 27% of those targeted were women.\nNote: This study was built around searches in English-language media and may omit cow-related violence reported only in Hindi and other language media. A cursory search through Hindi media appeared to throw up the same incidents.\n\nPS: NOT a gaurakshak, please put down your pitchforks.\n'

Men have 10% more chance in comitting suicide in India, and suicide rate has increased by 3 percent from 1980s to 2000. \n\nSure, some people would like to compare killing of cow vigilantes with terrorism, and not death by other causes. So lets go in there. \n\nThe article mentions 63 incidents in 7 years. US had 1094 [bias related](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election) crime incidents just after election, and that figure includes anti-Trump attacks too.

The numbers were over 5000. If you are looking at logic, that's a big jump. Sure, some people can argue Europe can have higher police reporting, but more than 20x reporting as in India, especially when even a brawl in train is given a beef angle by media? I highly doubt. \n\nLet's come to our home. \n\nBy fatalities, 158 people have died because of insurgency in [J&K alone](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/Cumulative_Fatalities.htm) this year. Maoist attacks killed 205. Please free to calculate the fatalities of all years from 2010 and let me know where Hindutwa terrorism stands.\n\nStats by itself have no meaning.

No particular law has been passed to deal with lynching,” India Today noted on June 25, 2017. “Absence of a codified law to deal with mob violence or lynching makes it difficult to deliver justice in the cases of riots. However, Section 223(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 says that persons or a mob involved in the same offence in the same act can be tried together.

"The sanghis would have riots if they wanted to flair the communal tensions but that sort of thing can backfire against you with the sort of international backlash and attention it generates.\n\nLynchings are the perfect plan because if you kill one muslim per day, the number would never be high to generate outrage in the pro govt media channels. People and newspapers would mostly ignore or not play it as a much bigger issue.\n\nWith daily lynchings, there would come a time when this would be a daily occurrence, people would become apathetic and no one would care to ask questions. The govt would still continue to label every non bjp state as a mini pakistan and continue flair the resentment against mainorities.\n\nMake no mistake. Today it is muslims. Tomorrow they will come for sikhs by weaving an imaginary khalistani story and arnab and rahul shivashankar to sell it for them. When they'd be done with them then they will turn to christians and buddhists and dalits.\nAnd that will be the time, when the talibanization of this country would be complete when there will be no more imaginary liberals to bash and cows to milk, when the opposition would realise that only hindutva sells and they would reorganize their own strategies and rewrite their own manifestoes.

For comparison, an average of eight people were killed daily on railway tracks in 2016.\n\nIt's not statistically insignificant if you can see an increase in the incidents, which is what we are seeing. It's not statistically insignificant if the ruling party is milking political mileage from it. "

'The study lists incidents of cow terrorism reported in English media over the past 7 years. Your comparisons are completely illogical. \n\n>Sure, some people would like to compare killing of cow vigilantes with terrorism, and not death by other causes. So lets go in there.\n\nYet you waste effort, time and space in mentioning death by accidents and suicide (and even point out that men are more likely to commit suicide). Why deflect when you yourself admit that it is unnecessary. \n\nYou then go and list all bias related crime incidents in US, mass shooting in US and religion inspired crime in US and compare it to cow-terrorism which is an unfair comparison since cow-terrorism is only type of religious terrorism in India. There are multiple others.\n\n>By fatalities, 158 people have died because of insurgency in J&K alone this year. Maoist attacks killed 205. Please free to calculate the fatalities of all years from 2010 and let me know where Hindutwa terrorism stands.\n\nCow-terrorism is one type of Hindutva terror. Have you forgotten the other riots in India caused by Hindutva?\n\n>I will be giving an unpopular opinion here, but anyway, let me go head and take the downvotes.\n\nNice attempt at playing the victim, but I will downvote you for deflecting. \n'

That amounts to 1.35 lakhs people dying each year. \n\nHow many Indians get terrorized by this and stop getting out of houses? Fewer people than these died in 26/11 attacks. I presume you're OK with ignoring that one, too.\n\nYou don't see a problem with state backed vigilantism?"
"That's a huge fallacy on your part. Why would you compare Hindutva lynchings with road accidents??\n\nLet us then compare the number of people who die in road accidents or suicides VS no of people who die in terrorist attacks.\n\nIf I were to take your logic at face value, then all investments on NIA, RAW, IB, Airport security, Coast guard and other anti-terrorist agencies should be stopped and people should divert all their attention to road accidents.\n\nPeople should stop caring about AIDS because most deaths are because of heart attacks. \n\nRoad accidents are not state sponsored.

"My school had 2 different uniforms for alternate days and they disallowed students from sitting in class if the found any aspect of the uniform faded or scuffed or 'Not up to their standards' and basically forced students to buy new shirts/T-shirts every 2-4 months as they were poor in quality and would fade in colour (Or worse, get torn up from somewhere) every 2-4 months. \n\nSame with notebooks and all, they forced you to buy their super expensive, super useless notebooks by including them in the fee package even though they knew everyone just buys decent sized registers from stationery shops and use those instead. Also, I'm not a 100% sure but during my later years in the school they were selling a massive package of all kinds of useless stationery equipment with their logo on it to younger kids by including it in the fee package.

'> “Let’s think about the fake sense of urgency that pervades the left-liberal humanitarian discourse on violence: in it, abstraction and graphic (pseudo)concreteness coexist in the staging of the scene of violence-against women, blacks, the homeless, gays . . . “A woman is rpaed every six seconds in this country” and “In the time it takes you to read this paragraph, ten children will die of hunger” are just two examples. Underlying all this is a hypocritical sentiment of moral outrage. Just this kind of pseudo-urgency was exploited by Starbucks a couple of years ago when, at store entrances, posters greeting costumers pointed out that a portion of the chain’s profits went into health-care for the children of Guatemala, the source of their coffee, the inference being that with every cup you drink, you save a child’s life. \n\n> There is a fundamental anti-theoretical edge to these urgent injunctions. There is no time to reflect: we have to act now. Through this fake sense of urgency, the post-industrial rich, living in their secluded virtual world, not only do not deny or ignore the harsh reality outside the area-they actively refer to it all the time. As Bill Gates recently put it: “What do the computers matter when millions are still unnecessarily dying of dysentery?”\n> Against this fake urgency, we might want to place Marx’s wonderful letter to Engels of 1870, when, for a brief moment, it seemed that a European revolution was again at the gates. Marx’s letter conveys his sheer panic: can’t the revolution wait for a couple of years? He hasn’t yet finished his ‘Capital’.”\n> \n> ― Slavoj Žižek'
'Shame on you, India'
'Did you really expect these people to miraculously change after taking a pledge? Get real man, everyone was there to see Coldplay, no one gives two shits about the pledge and what not. '
'i never throw my garbage on the streets and outside my my instinct dont allow me to do it i feel too bad throwing out in the open and i keep it in the bag'
'This Shit is frustrating, for real. '
"People in India don't crush the bottle thus the garbage bins were flooded by 5 in the evening. There wasn't enough place to throw the bottles. So no use of clicking such photos or mocking. Many people tripped on those bottles during the concert too."
'I see your point but beyond the whining comments here the reality is often that there are few, if any, dustbins. Faced with the choice between taking your trash home or chucking it on the street, most people, affluent or not, will choose the latter.\n\nThis is the vicious cycle in india.'
"This is probably the reason. The organizers expect people to dump garbage on the ground anyways, and plan for clean-up after but don't plan to have enough bins in the first place."
'There were no backpacks allowed in the venue. You could only keep trash in your hands until you find dustbin. \nI hate that people are outraging without trying to understand the situation. '
'Man, I love India but it disgusts and saddens me to see so much filth and trash everywhere on the streets. Indian govt needs to improve its infrastructure, imagine how many jobs could be given to so many people working in plants, picking up trash, recycling items, etc. theres a lot of economic/financial potential in that industry.'
"This is why I'm worried about our Mars mission. \n  \n/s"
"I thought we learned to get over this shitty attitude with Satyamev Jayate. There's nothing 'Indian' about India's problems, except the relative difficulty in implementation because of all the diversity. They are systematic problems which have been solved by nations easily but are romanticized as things that make us 'Indian'.  "
"Indians and filth don't go together, everywhere. The same Indians are so cautious about throwing a trash on the roads while outside the country. Indians have a mentality of following the herd. *If there's trash, I will add to it. If there's none, then I will find a trash can.*"
'Urban youth sometimes are the worst. A lot of them are entitled brats.'
"More importantly, many of these places have **NO BINS** in any reasonable proximity. While I can't comment on this venue itself, I've had to hang on to some piece of litter for *ages* (tissue paper, plastic cup, empty bottle) while walking around, and finally give up and find a shop and ask them to throw it in their bin. This is in Bangalore. Garbage urban planning.\n\nThis has nothing to do with wealth or education. If there were clearly labeled bins at close intervals (ideally within 20-30 feet of any spot with high foot-traffic, like marketplaces, popular hangout spots, and the city center), and if they were and emptied and cleaned regularly, I can bet you'd see a 70-80% drop in litter immediately. \n\nIf you're going to make people go out of their way and hunt around for a trash can, hide them in stupid areas, or leave them full, or have them spaced out at 500m between bins (not within clear line-of-sight, so Anshul-bhai has to *guess* that there *may* be a bin *somewhere down that road*), you can be damned sure that even the well-intentioned people will lose their patience and drop it on the street.\n\nThis is a failure of urban planning and maintenance."
"No just a general Indian mindset. Cleanliness doesn't extend beyond keeping the house spotless. Rest of the country can get fucked as far as these people are concerned."
"That is in bad taste mate. The show was good,people weren't."
'You know what makes this worse? The fact that the tickets costed an arm and a leg when compared to the salary of the average Indian. Nobody expected these people to literally dump shit there.'

'Chill out Mr. Bhakt. Criticizing what should be criticized is not self hating.'
'Generally, there are no garbage bins anywhere in India'
"The change must come top down. This is I always repeat and say pretty often while discussing these issues - unless all level of  Govts. heavily affect the pockets of common man, they will never change. It should be done with heavy penalties, strong enforcement without a single bit of corruption from the Public officials. People are inherently lazy and don't care until their lifestyle/pocket/earnings are deeply affected. Enforce laws and carry out penalties without caring about demography, rich/affluent, poor, literate, illiterate, men, women child, seniors - everybody should be in the gambit of law enforcement, no care what, the law breakers have to pay a heavy penalty if found littering on the streets, indulging in anything anti-social or un-civic behavior in public.\n\nDo it, and we have a better country. And yes, one last thing. Incorporate civic duties/responsibilities/volunteerism right from the Kindergarten and see it being followed through academically to Masters, Ph.D.s, and other institutions."
'Th Indan govt collects about 4% of GDP in taxes, compared with the US that collects 27% of GDP (and has 8x the GDP).  If India can raise its tax collection, it should have funds for infrastructure and sanitation.  Society cannot depend on "volunteers" to keep it pristine.\n\nImagine a society with no cops and no courts, just pleas like "please don\'t kill or steal, we want the country to do well".  Sure, most won\'t kill or steal out of dignity.  But what do you think will happen?  Some thieves and murderers will realize how easy it is without cops or courts to worry about.  Some lesser criminals will see how easy it is for them and join.  Society cannot survive on pleas for help from citizens.\n\nI live in an area where the left side of every street is cleaned on odd days and the right side on even days.  If you park your car on the wrong side, tow trucks carry it off and you\'re fined $400 plus $150 per day you don\'t collect your car.  (Sucks when it\'s a Friday and they\'re closed on weekends).  The street cleaning vehicles are large industrial trucks, the tow trucks are also, well, trucks, the parking lots for car violators are massive.  The fines are steep, strict, and non-negotiable.\n\nWhat society do people in India want to live in? One where there are posters whimpering pleas for people to please help keep things clean?  Or one where industrial machines and technology can remedy the problem and add harsh punitive fines on violators?\n\nI don\'t want to hear "this is a democracy, we can\'t..". I live in a democracy not the Middle East or some repressive regime.  There\'s a saying here, "your rights end where another person\'s begins".  You don\'t have the right to eve-tease or make another person feel uncomfortable.  It\'s their right to feel safe.  You don\'t have a right to heap filth wherever you please, it\'s another person\'s right to walk on clean streets.  Sanitation is not a privilege.  It\'s a basic, fundamental, human right.  My cousin got typhoid in his 10th grade.  Seriously, India, typhoid?!  Get your shit together.  Messing with sanitation is messing with other people\'s basic rights.  It\'s undemocratic to *not* punish violators.\n\nChoice is not democracy.  It\'s lack of order, the key half of "law & order".  Criminals can\'t just choose to not go to jail after their crimes.  Put up clear signs of the fines, surveillance cameras to catch violators, mail fines to their homes and if they don\'t pay, deduct it straight from their bank account plus a non-payment penalty.  If they don\'t have funds, summons for arrest and the judge can order community service so they work off their fines in labor.  I\'m not speaking of Singapore or Dubai, this is how it is in the US.  I\'ve seen people give up getting lucky with a hot girl on a night because they have to move their car so they won\'t get fined.  That is order, where people are more terrified of getting fined than scoring with a girl.  Ideally would it be nice if people were angels without punishment?  Of course.  But don\'t kid yourself.\n'

'Yeah, "those idiots" that wrote those books that you want desperately to steal because you can\'t write books of that quality yourself.'
'Copy right infringement is not theft'
"Yeah. All the professional textbooks cost anywhere between 50 to 200$. Some even go as high as 500-600$. Each Journal paper costs around 30$. This is way too expensive for any student to afford given that you have 4 to 6 subjects in every semester. \n\nBasically the publishing houses and academic staff are in collusion to determine the prices. Sometimes even the writer doesn't get paid much. Publishing houses are core to this problem. "
"And the authors themselves make very little, if any, money out of this.  I don't know the exact numbers but from what I've heard the authors get very little royalties from the books sold, and most of their income is from the contract itself. So, it's not like the authors lose out on any income from this. \n\nAnd the textbooks themselves are largely generic. The few pockets of specialized knowledge that they provide are certainly not commensurate with the absurd amounts that the book publications charge. Not to mention the fact that these publishing companies usually have deals with the academic institutions which then force the students to buy the latest editions of the books for homework problems even though the earlier editions usually have all the relevant information."
"The copyright act in India exempts copyright suit in case of copying of education material for education purposes. So if you xerox books for educational purposes, it's legal. For commercial purposes, it's illegal. "

"I have tried everything but she's not interested. She does use YouTube mostly to watch quilling videos. Previously before Schizophrenia she used to be on fb now she has stopped using it. Except whatsapp. Also she has stopped watching tv, newspaper. I have tried hooking her up with some great shows such as friends, Breaking Bad, Better call Saul and more but all failed. She's mostly into studying things and creative stuffs. \n\nI have unlimited internet connection at home, tata sky, she has a Redmi 3s. So there's no short of connecting to the web. She's just not interested.  "
"She said the meds are not working, she's getting more weaker. Not able to walk for long distance. (Her heart rate was above 95 and 100 with meds, now it's down to 70).  Also the meds were making her fat, it's  not unusual, Olanzapine is main suspect. Doctor tried to out her on abilify which didn't work I guess.\n\nMeds can only able to cut off auditory hallucinations by 90% the other 10% you have to live with it. Most of all she didn't think or accept she's mentally ill and has Schzophrenia. I have talked with her about it many times but she's not listening. Made chart about more natural ways to cure it, she threw it away.\n\n"
'Stress can lead to schizophrenia ?\nI always thought this condition was genetic . '
"It's  still unknown why Schizophrenia happens. Yes it could be genetic but a change in surroundings (frustrating), mental pressure also can lead to it. \n\nMy dad's brother's daughter had same problems years ago (they said), and my sister's extreme thoughts about that boy girl's situation, a mental pressure, failure to understand what should be done could have also lead to her situation.\n\nIt's still unclear what happened to her, she needs to see a doctor personally.

No.\n\nThe question is where the government should draw the line, cultural reasons, religious reasons, health reasons...'
'This is such a stupid point. People who want beef ban do not want it because they don\'t like beef, it\'s because they consider cow sacred and don\'t want it slaughtered. The ban is similar to ban on slaughter of "pet animals" like dogs and cats in the west.'
'He is stupid'
'First they came for the beef, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I did not eat beef.\n\nThen they came for the lamb, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I did not eat lamb.\n\nThen they came for the fish, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I did not eat fish.\n\nThen they came for chicken—and there was no one left to speak for me.'

"Its just hypocrisy of the users, Freedom of eating what you want is limited by the culture you're born in but that doesn't give right to stifle freedom of others to do what they want. If eating dog is wrong then so is cow and drinking but if one isn't wrong then others shouldn't be wrong also. \n\nPeople nowadays have become pro prohibition here, I mean the hypocrisy cannot be put in words. "
"it's illegal to sell dog and cat meat in the United States, and religion has nothing to do with it. \n \n I get the anti-BJP position here to stubbornly eat meat. I don't agree with the religious imposition on other citizens. That's bad.  \n  \nBut this isn't just a religious issue, as some would like to believe. This is also an issue of animal rights. If we were talking about a religious ban on eating.. avocados.. then absolutely let's all eat as many as we want and stick it to these religious fascists.  \nBut we're talking about a sentient animal here. Cattle are quite intelligent. If India gets a mainstream beef industry going, there will be such a huge market for beef it's going to be tragic. Industrialized farming is one of the greatest sins of modern man. And trying to feed a market like India will be so, so sad. Not to mention terrible for the environment. \n  \nI just wish people would talk about the animal welfare side of this argument too. It's been quite left out so far. "

'Well there\'s speculation that Escobar killed himself, he did say he\'d shoot himself in the air if it came to being caught vs dying\n\nTo the assholes who don\'t like the idea of Escobar killing himself.  \nFrom : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar#Death (emphasis mine)\n>16 months after his escape from La Catedral, Pablo Escobar died in a shootout on 2 December 1993, amid another of Escobar\'s attempts to elude the Search Bloc. A Colombian electronic surveillance team, led by Brigadier Hugo Martínez, used radio triangulation technology to track his radiotelephone transmissions and found him hiding in Los Olivos, a middle-class barrio in Medellín. With authorities closing in, a firefight with Escobar and his bodyguard, Alvaro de Jesús Agudelo (a.k.a. "El Limón"), ensued. The two fugitives attempted to escape by running across the roofs of adjoining houses to reach a back street, but both were shot and killed by Colombian National Police. **Escobar suffered gunshots to the leg and torso, and a fatal gunshot through the ear**.\n\n>It has never been proven who actually fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight or as part of a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. **Some of Escobar\'s relatives believe that he had committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo would state that Pablo "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they went after him, he would say to me every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would \'shoot himself through the ear\'."**'

Its goal was to eliminate the dangers placed on young girls who could not handle the stress of married life and avoid early deaths. This Act defined a male child as 21 years (originally 18) or younger, a female child as 18 years (originally 14) or younger, and a minor as a child of either sex 18 years or younger (originally 14). The punishment for a male between 18 and 21 years marrying a child became imprisonment of up to 15 days, a fine of 1,000 rupees, or both.\n\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_India)\n\n\n*Now if goalposts are shifted and it is said Narendra was just a boy and it was his parents who got him married off, then*..\n\n> The punishment for a parent or guardian of a child taking place in the marriage became imprisonment of up to three months or a possible fine.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n> so the marriage would be null and void?\n\nFrom the same source:\n\n\n> .. an under-age marriage, where either the man or woman is over 16 years old, would not be a void marriage but voidable one, which would become valid if no steps are taken by such court as has option[s] to order otherwise. \n\n'

We are educated people but our youngsters have to leave the state in order to find a job. Im not exaggerating, every single house has at least one family members who's an NRI. Another is pollution and really bad waste management. There's garbage everywhere.

It is like saying, hey, at least I don't do it!!!! THAT IS NOT THE POINT! There ARE some Indians who do it! It is about THEM! You are just proving the cartoon right and actually showing the insensitivity of Indians! Should the statistic start mentioning what percentage of people say that, perhaps? After doing a poll or a study ? \nIndians do it ! Maybe not you, but did you find YOUR name in it? It is like _chor ki dadhi me tinka_ ! Some/few/many/all ! forget HOW MANY!"
'I hope you realize that the intersection between these 2 populations is not very high right? NRIs are probably least likely to make racist comments when they see a foreigner in India.. so your advice does not really hold.'

There are laws against it being institutional, but to suggest that the race of a person has zero impact on the probability of them having a specific lifestyle or characteristic, then that is quite dishonest. It\'s important to note that it\'s probability, not guaranteed. The latter is poor generalization, the former is reasonable. \n\nIf someone treats you poorly because of your religion, race, ethnicity or any other attribute, and the characterization is incorrect, pretend to be HP or McDonald\'s or randia or a lawyer. There\'s no reason to take greater offense because it\'s ethnicity, religion, etc. That is a large part of the problem.'
'That\'s not really the case here, those are just stereotypical jokes. Not meant to be taken seriously. How many Indians actually go straight up to these foreigners and tell them these things?

It reminded me of that day in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table. "
"First of all, I wouldn't say we did not give a fuck when Nigerian was beaten.

Where the FUCK does it mention that ALL INDIANS do that? It is like saying, hey, at least I don't do it! THAT IS NOT THE POINT! There ARE some Indians who do it! It is about THEM! "

So yes racism is more common in India than in the US. Same thing in Japan/Korea/China, Europe. I personally have a Chinese friend teaching English in Japan who gets harassed daily by his Japanese students and the school board can't do anything to defend him.

"On a tangential note, I wonder why the skewed sex ratio hasn't solved the dowry problem yet? One'd have thought the lack of enough brides would have given the girl's parents enough options where they wouldn't have to pay any dowry. Especially in Noida/Delhi. \n\nSomewhat anecdotally, in some rural areas in Karnataka, there is now an almost streamlined process of finding suitable brides from rural northern India. And of course there is magnitudes more geographical mobility for middle class. So clearly geographical (and even cultural to an extent since they'd have preferred brides from their own community) barriers are breaking up both for rural & urban situations. Information barriers (i.e who is eligible etc) will erode faster with higher internet penetration and more Shaadi.com/Tinder-like apps. \n\nSo what was the issue in Noida that stopped more information (in terms of internet & matchmaking sites) and demand-supply economics from killing the dowry practice? Or is the explanation that the dowry demands are slowly reducing due to these external forces and it's just too soon/naive to expect a centuries-old practice to have died already?"

"> Aren't all such purchases through Cheque or Card ?\n\nI asked this same question yesterday and someone around here gave the answer that made sense. Its all about the lack of cushion for spending the white money now. There are lots of corrupt babus in our country who had lots of black income. This black income used to be spent on necessities in cash, whereas the above white income was free to be spent on luxuries like cars and other things. Now that the black cushion has disappeared due to note-ban, they are forced to spend the white on necessities, thus the lack of demand in the auto and finance sectors.

Foundation of any solid relationship. \n\nIt will be consensual only when it is the norm. Even the bride's family will demand even higher dowry when it is their turn to get their son married. \n\nIt is vicious cycle which causes a lot of issues.

They feel that they can't get the money back similarly through dowry if they don't have a son.\n\nThat's why it is still a problem even it is consensual. "

'Marriage between hindu minors though illegal is not void. once they are married, it is a valid marriage, however it is voidable at the option of either of the parties until they reach age of majority.'
"> because lack of consent is rape regardless of the age or marital status, if you ask me.  <\n\nAgreed, it's really a no-brainer, but if I'm not wrong there is no law against marital rape, which is really messed up. IIRC they recently took a stand to *not take a stand* on marital rape since apparently men might be wrongly accused of it for extortion and other reasons like it being *against* the institution of marriage!\n\nEdit - Formatting on mobile sucks. "

">>lack of consent is rape regardless of age and marital status\n\nIndia doesn't recognize marital rape as rape. So it's technically legal to rape your wife. But SC's ruling would protect minors (who are forced into child marriage) from being raped    \nEdit: format"
'Martial rape is still legal in India, though. So until they fix that, they get no pat on the back. They even defended it recently.'

">Why the fk was this law made gender specific and not gender neutral?! \n\nBecause rape laws are only pertaining to women. The sc can't make the law applicable to men when the law explicitly refers to women only. \n\nNot a fun fact: sec 377, the controversial homosexuality law, is the closest form of relief to male rape victims. "
'That is why important to avoid enrolling in aadhar. For fake birth certificates.'
'There are no laws for imaginary people.'
'Rape by definition is any sexual contact that happens *without mutual consent*. If it is violent then it\'s violent rape. Rape need not be violent all the time. India\'s laws probably need to adapt and be gender neutral because men do get raped as well, but that\'s another issue for another time. \n  \nPeople the age of 18 are considered to not be able to consent. Marriages in India broadly happen between older men and younger women. If a woman is below 18 and shes married to an older man, she cannot consent to having sex legally. Thus the man is considered to have committed rape against her if they have sex. Earlier this was not the case.  \n  \nThis will give the woman an "out" of the marriage if she so chooses. \n  \nIn the exception where both parties are below 18, the US (various states) have Romeo and Juliet laws to protect minors who have sex with each other from criminal prosecution. '
'Even in west it is considered as rape. Some states say 16 some 18.'
'you have a point but you used it in the wrong context '
"This does not happen. You don't require a judge's permission to get married before 18. Marriage for minors is voidable but valid for Hindus (although illegal and a crime if reported) for Muslim minors it's void ab initio and no judge can deem it valid because that would be contravention of contract law.\n\nThis is because Hindu Marriages are unions while Muslim ones are contracts and a minor cannot consent to contracts "

"*Chief Minister's Office, Kerala* posted this on facebook:\n\n> The Government of India’s Gazette Notification prohibiting the slaughter of cattle and imposing restrictions on cattle trade is part of the effort to destroy the secular fabric of our country.\n\n> India is a land of different religions and cultures. Diversity is the essence of our democracy. The actions of our Central Government is in contradiction to it. The Sangh Parivar has orchestrated riots in several parts of the country in the name of cow slaughter. However, ox and buffalo are also included in this prohibition. Millions of people across the country slaughter these animals for food consumption. Meat is not consumed by people of any particular faith alone. People of all faiths have been consuming meat since time immemorial. By prohibiting slaughter, the Government has meddled with the people’s right to consume whatever food they prefer to. We need to take note of the fact that meat is the main source of protein for poor and ordinary people in this country. It is precisely why this is an attack on the poor people of this country. Across the country we should rise in rage against such crude measures. If cattle consumption is prohibited today, it may very well be fish tomorrow.\n\n> Prohibition of cattle slaughter will do away with the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Indians. Once the prohibition comes into effect, raw material for the leather industry will not be available anymore. More than 2.5 million people work in India’s leather industry. Most of them are dalits. Hence, this prohibition will severely affect our disadvantaged sections.\n\n> The Sangh Parivar had unleashed wide scale attacks on those who were trading and transporting cattle in the recent past. Instead of putting an end to manslaughter in the name of cows the Government prohibits the slaughter of cattle, making it evident once again as to who holds the reins of this Government."

"Other countries must be rofling at India right now. Our fucking turd of a government is making laws about what people can eat and what people can't. Can you believe it? At a time when there are so fucking many problems plaguing our country, where 30% of our people still make some 100 rupees a day, where half of rural population shits in the open our government is busy making laws about what food its citizens can/can't eat. I can't believe this shit.\n\nWith all this shit going on, I have a newfound respect for us. We grow, we develop despite our government being a total loser."
'Lol there are people defending this ban by saying its unhealthy to consume red meat, though there might be some truth to that but guess what? Kerala has the [highest life expectancy ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_by_life_expectancy_at_birth)in India, so your "health" argument is moot, the average Malayali still lives the longest even though he/she consumes beef.\n\n\nHeck, maybe somebody should start a whatsapp forward saying consuming beef increases life expectancy, with so much other nonsense being forwarded as facts and gullible people believing it, a little pro-beef forwards wouldn\'t hurt.'
"One more reason to be proud  of my home state Kerala...\n\nBeef is my birthright and i shall have it....\n\nThe fact is , the entirety of Kerala is unified against this ban. We might not really care of North Indian Politics, we may not be zealous patriots, we may not be armed forces lovers, but dammit we are one heck of beef lovers.. beef curry, beef fry, beef and tapioca.. just writing these words make me salivate. \nTrying to force the ban will lead to civil uprising that can easily destroy BJP from Kerala, where it just have startd taking baby steps. \nThis is one reason, why BJP fails to make any good progress in Kerala.\n\nBeef is not food.. Beef is an emotion .\n\nIt it too ingrained in our culture. I personally don't know a single one person here in Kerala who doesn't eat nor love beef. Every one of these BJP fanatics in Kerala eat beef. Even one of the leaders of BJP in Kerala , after protesting against cow killings, went and had beef at the local eatery. \n\nBeef is Love ..Love is Beef. "
'Being a Keralite and used to having beef for everyday meals, its really horrifying for me to be slapped on the face by this new rule. '

"While I don't personally have a stance on banning beef, it is extremely unfair of the centre to impose the culture of cow belt states on every other state in India. If a state's population holds the Cow to be sacred and does not want it to be slaughtered, that's completely fine, make a law in that state which prohibits cow slaughter/consumption of beef in that state, but to enact a nation-wide legislation with zero regard for other people's culture, that too in a country like India is incredibly insensitive and stupid. On top of that, if you hold the cow to be sacred then only ban cow slaughter, why has buffalo and bull meat been banned?"

"Instead of going to court, would have been better if Kerala and other States **simply refused to enforce the rule**. \n\nWhat would Centre have done in that case ? \nPresident's Rule ? (Art 356 - when State Govt refuses to follow a Law, it can be dismissed). \n\nWhat if large sections of the Kerala Police revolted against President's Rule and/or the Govt instructs the State Police to resist the Central Authorities ? Send the CRPF and other CAPFs/Army to fight Kerala Police ? What if a few Keralites within the CRPF, Army and other Central Govt Organizations also revolt and/or actively sabotage ? Many companies and battalions in the Madras Regiment and Madras Sappers of the Indian Army are entirely composed of Malayali soldiers.\n\nIn short, A disaster and a mini civil war which we can ill afford when we are facing external enemies on 2 fronts."
'This ban is going to alter the landscape of livestock business. I am from TN and I know desperate farmers who sell their aged cattle due to obvious reasons. I think the protests over the ban on Jallikattu and the gross mentality that ensued is one of the reasons behind the silence from my state. Cheap source of protein is hard to come by in our country and the centre has ignored this fact. Not only will the beef eater and the tanner will be affected, but the farmers who want to sell old animals will be forced to leave them unattended which will make matters worse(think road accidents). This law is unnecessary and offensive to a large portion of Indians.'

'No one gives a shit. \n\n'
'Fake Headline.\n\nNobody is being denied anything to eat. \n\n\nIf you were buying meat from criminals and illegal traders then you are the problem.\n\n\nIf You want to eat meat, and I also do, buy with full price from an organized market.\n\nAnd don\'t give his hogwash excuse of "small time ; small scale",. If you are procuring meat from a legal source ( who does not steals cattle) then you should not have problem with this law.\n\n\nIllegal cattle stealing gangs have funded politicians and this is why UP banned slaughterhouses, because they weren\'t getting money anymore from those who stole cattle.\n\n\nBeing a meat eater, I support this move of center.\n\n\nA lot of dadri like incidents would be stopped because there would be no point in  stealing cattle anymore .'

But other states like Arunachal, Nagaland, Meghalaya have a significant population who eat beef, buff and such kinds of meat. Cattle slaughter ban won't be effective in these states. Overall your statement holds true."
"I've always believed that Kerala and TN should present a united face when going up against this Government. Sure, Tamil Hindus may not eat beef, but we're a secular state with large Muslim, Christian and low caste populations who will be affected by this bullshit. We also have a large leather industry which provides employment to many poor Muslims and low caste Hindus. I would love nothing more than a secular united South Indian + NE bloc to act as a foil against this Government's divisive religious agenda, but I think at least Kerala+Tamil Nadu is workable at this stage."

"This actually sounds good, but implementation is the problem. For all its faults, the Indian censor board is among the most transparent ones in the world-- information about what cuts are needed are clearly made available to the filmmaker as well as the public. Even MPAA does its cutting and rating activities behind closed doors, and there is little public accountability there.\n\nTelling the censor board that they cannot cut may still result in them demanding cuts -- except this time, no information will be made public. The CBFC will simply stare out the window until a filmmaker returns with a few cuts that the CBFC is willing to give them new certification for.\n\nWe must remember that it's not the organization or the rules that has the most influence on how badly a film is censored; rather, it's the people who run these organizations. The British censor board is almost identical to the Indian one -- they also have censorship powers. But they don't exercise this censorship as regularly as their Indian counterparts.\n\nEven self-regulation (i.e., industry forming their own censor board) will be of little help. I think the censor board, or any mandatory classification board, is an outdated idea. Theatrical exhibitors and multiple independent resources need to be the ones to help audiences make better and smarter choices on what to watch."
'Well they force producers to cut "objectionable" scenes or else they won\'t issue certification, it\'s a forceful moral practice that is forced upon people. CBFC justifies this practice with cinematography Act of 19fucking52 which has way too many ambiguous terms for the Board to exploit. '
'This. I made a post Ony the same day as Amazon launched Prime Video. Some people told me "Bhai Netflix/Hotstar use karle".

"Nothing proves this more than their [statement](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/r5i1KsIe9yLNLhRp9ExhZI/Amazon-says-dont-care-about-protectionist-calls-by-Flipkart.html) that they don't care about Flipkart et al's calls for the Government to become protectionist.

"There were no cuts except for the pissing scene in the theatrical release anyway. The Netflix version is the one that was released theatrically. I hoped they'd put up the completely untouched version but I think it was a case of studio versionitis. "
"Not possible to unsubscribe from Prime. All I can do is not renew my subscription next year. \n\nBesides, that's not the point even. Amazon is a huge company and everything they do sets a precedent. Censoring when they're not required to sets a horrible precedent and it's impossible to vote with your wallet when they're pricing predatorily and don't care about how much they're making."
"The Censor Board doesn't represent the people in any significant way. I believe their actions are equally condemnible, but their existence is mandated by law. Amazon censorship is not.\n\nThose words you mentioned show up on TV all the time -- the I&B Ministry has no advisory banning those words. It's the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council that oversees these complaints and they are generally perceived as a liberal organisation. Self-censorship is the culprit here also. \n\nAs for the porn ban, you're behaving like it was a deliberate and organised action by the government -- in fact, it was a procedural fuck-up by the attorney general who was representing the government in a case demanding the porn ban -- she sent DEITY a note to 'look into' the petitioner's list and they sent an advisory to ban the sites. Even without that much domestic outrage the ban was withdrawn. "
'Cropped films are the worst. Hotstar is worse than Prime in this; every single American film on Prime is cropped to 16:9, which cuts out upto a fourth of the frame.'
"> no one has ever driven on a bumper-less road before \n\nHotstar and Netflix have both been offering uncensored content for nearly a year though, so there's plenty precedent."
"This logic is incorrect, disingenuous, and cowardly.\n\nStar India is worth over $11 billion but they still leave HBO content uncensored online, while complying with broadcasting laws for TV. There is no reason why Amazon shouldn't be doing the same thing.\n\nThere is no compellingly significant risk for Amazon in leaving their content uncensored. Period. \n\n> If they get caught in a controversy, their online business could get targeted.\n\nAside from social media outrage there is no real risk to their online business. See Snapdeal -- trolls went crazy at their Aamir Khan thing (which I believe is the maximum extent of possible damage for Amazon too), but it didn't affect their bottom line in any significant manner."
"Well..  since the certification process involves deletion of portions of a movie even for A rated films, and the board has the power to deny a certificate and showing a movie without a certificate is illegal, its a censor board by default :)   (Also, it was called the censor board till the 80's it seems. then they just changed the name)"

There is an episode in Grand Tour where they ride in cars covered with cow carcasses. I can only imagine what would happen if some Sanghi bigshot saw the episode and whispered something crazy in Modi's ear. Even Tata goes to Mohan Bhagwat to get his quarrel resolved with Mystry.\n\nThis country has gone extremely right wing in the past few years, businesses must not be heroes, they have investors whose trust must not be broken.\n\nRegarding Star India, their primary business is showbiz, so the argument doesn't apply there.\n\n"
"> Is it illegal to show uncensored films in UK?\n\nSurprisingly yes. There was even a guy on reddit who sent the British censor board a 4 hour film of paint drying to protest this.\n\n> The key difference is that in US, it is not illegal to show uncertified films.. MPAA doesnt have the power of the law behind it. In India, the CBFC has the power of the law behind it\n\nTrue. A better comparison would be the Korean censor board, which isn't allowed to mandate cuts, but does operate in the shady way I have described. Plus, they have government mandate.\n\n"

"> businesses must not be heroes\n\nThe mass of customers and the ecosystem as a whole is more important. The risk is also minimal/non-existent, something you clearly seem to disagree with.\n\n> Regarding Star India, their primary business is showbiz, so the argument doesn't apply there.\n\nSo what? If anything that makes them more, not less vulnerable. If Prime Video faces government scrutiny (highly unlikely) then their retail business will not even be in the ambit. For Star, though, content on all verticals may be under the magnifier."

"Its quite funny and cringe worthy the effort people are putting into spewing bigotry in the pretense of sincerely caring about an issue.\n\nI really don't think anybody of those people really believe in half the shit they are saying but for the sake of those who may have unintentionally ended up  being a part of the circlejerk, I'll just drop some points.\n\nMany here have commented how Malappuram has descended into a misogynistic hellhole or something along that line. Of course I mean how many districts in India have a 95%+ literacy rate for women. Look at all those girls being forced to go to schools and colleges!\n\nThis is not Saudi Arabia where women don't drive at all. If a household has a vehicle, there is a good chance that the woman in the household also drive it. As far as Kunju Muhammed is not sitting in his house 24/7, he is going to see thousands of women riding scooters, bikes and cars every day. So why is he not going around assaulting all these people? Why only pick on one lady throughout the year? Even the title suggests 'allegedly assaulted'. Randia is usually  skeptical of news articles posted here. But hey look! we can blame this one of Muslims if we take this at face value, so why not?\n\nNow assuming the woman's allegations are true(it is definitely possible), what is the reasoning behind the assumption that his misogyny is religion-based? There is absolutely nothing in the article to suggest that, and some evidence to suggest that it might be rich-poor discrimination. Because his name is Kunju Muhammed as the OP took specific care to provide in the title? So if a man named Rama Iyer Swamy or Mathew Francis commits a crime, its because of Hinduism or Christianity? Our culture is still patriarchal to an extent, and this was a 60 year old man from the older generation.\n\nNow ok, lets take our assumption a step further and assume that he indeed did it due to his religious beliefs. Its not off the table, there are plenty of religious nutheads in the country, and this man was from an older generation. For one thing it was an isolated incident. And compare it to  all the other misgonystic acts occuring in the country. Hell, the prevalent rapes done on lower caste women by high caste men in rural areas could be argued to be a direct result of religious beliefs. But I dont want to dwell into that, because I believe its never religion making people doing this, just that people find a reason in religion to try justify their acts. \n\nLets compare this to a recent incident, which was also posted in this sub. In Mainpuri, UP, a woman was groped and beaten up for resisting. Comparing both cases,\n\n* She was sexually assaulted.\n* She was beaten up badly in front of her family including her  3 year old daughter.\n* Both this acts were done in front of a large crowd who stood their doing nothing.\n* There was clear video evidence for the act.\n\nSexual assault, physical assault, irresponsible citizens and clear-cut evidence. But look at how sincerely Randia cared about it in comparison. 147 upvotes, 49 comments vs 811 upvotes, 268 comments this post about an alleged physical assault got for the sole reason that the perpetrator was called Kunju Muhammed. So ironic that someone just reposted complaining about how little attention the Mainpuri incident got because the victim wasn't a minority(more likely because the perpetrator wasn't).\n\nI understand that a bunch of you people hate Islam. I understand that you have such low self-esteem that you need find any reason to put down a group of people so you can feel better about yourself in comparison.\n\nBut please don't do it in the pretense of being sincerely  concerned about the issue and the country. It comes out as really cringeworthy. Its so funny and sad at the same time.\n"

"Those saying Zomato acted 'courteously' here, haven't really experience courteous behavior it seems.\n\nIf your food hasn't been delivered in 1.5 hours, and the OP has to go food hunting again (which will probably take additional 45 mins at least) then its completely reasonable to demand a full refund. Most companies in the US will actually give a full refund and deliver the food for free in such situations, but just because the indian janta is used to bad experiences, so much so that people in this thread are even defending zomato, companies get a free pass. Either that, or I suspect lots of Zomato-ian redditors here. "
'I recently had a row with Zomato because the rep I had was pretty blatantly lying. For an order that was already 1.5 hours late, Zomato told me "Sir, I have spoken with the restaurant, the order would "only take 10 - 15 minutes more" while the restaurant was on the line with me, at that very moment, to tell me that what I ordered wasn\'t available. **1.5 hours later**. \n\nLambasted them both - one for waiting 1.5 hours after confirming the order to tell me something wasn\'t available and keeping the charade going through Zomato by telling me it was "on its way" and Zomato for literally straight up lying and giving me placeholder responses under the guise of "handling" me. \n\nThen had to deal with the manager of said store (likely getting fucked by *his* management) calling me up the next morning insisting that he was going to dispatch my order for free to my office, despite never asking for it and genuinely never wanting to order from the place again. '
"Ok this is my recent experience with them and I must say Zomato is quite shitty at the CC game also their policies are very consumer unfriendly.\nThey provide deliveries take their cut but don't hold themselves accountable to any standards, in this instance I ordered Burgers what was delivered to me was unrecognizable mush 1:30 hrs late over specified delivery time, the restaurant is 3.5 km away. Btw its was 11pm and had no other alternative so slept hungry that day. \n[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/BZo2L)"
"That's weird and arbitrary. I have got my order cancelled and refunded by Zomato when they could not contact the restaurant. Sorry about your experience OP. Unlike others here, I don't think you are being unreasonable here at all."
"Why don't people just call their local restaurant. It's like they're adding more points of failure to a process then complain when it fails."
"Had this happen to me. Immediately gave Zomato 1 star on the Play store. They refused to cancel the order by simply not replying to any message over 20 minutes. When they did reply it'd be about some other detail. "
"Sad you've got shitty customer representative. Better send them an email, ask them about the guidelines if order is refund and demand to speak with a senior most representative on this issue. If you gonna keep on using the available chat service option, you will get shitty automated reply."
'What the crap is this even? Now I guess ordering on Zomato is off the cards'
'Only pay cod .. that way you can refuse to pay for the delivery if it goes beyond time.'
'Nice. Time to switch from ICICI I guess.\nI had a similar situation as yours and they basically shrugged their shoulders and said "you verified the transaction with an otp, so it isn\'t our problem" :/'
"Saar if you start uninstalling apps after a single bad experience you won't have any apps left.\n\nEveryone has bad days, can't let one sour experience to make you uninstall the app. At least use that 150 rs credit he added to your account :P \n\n\n"
"I've had a similar bad experience with Zomato so here's the thing. Zomato hands over the order to the restaurant to fulfill and deliver which is usually things get fucked. In my case, a late night order got screwed because the restaurant gladly accepted the order from Zomato, shut his shutter and fucked off. \n\nWhen it comes to ordering prefer swiggy/FP as these guys send their guys to pick up food and deliver so the chances of an order getting screwed are less. Baaki customer service kya hota hai ghanta kisse pata hai yahan."
"Never ever pay these fuckers online... lesson learned the hard way. Even if the confirm that the restaurant didn't deliver, they will still take 3 to 5 working days to refund it. If i can pay instantly, i should also be refunded instantly. Because a lot of people forget to check if it's processed after 5 days or not (KFC did this to me).\n\nIt's better to lose those shitty 50 rs discounts they give to encourage online payments than get duped 500 rs in one go."
'Stop bitching and be patient. The response is reasonable, they are only asking you to wait until they can get in touch with the restaurant. Unless you invested all your savings on this order, give it time. '
'OP is one really big asshole. He clearly says that its a 2 step procedure. 1.Customer contacts Zomato 2.Zomato contacts restaurant. Number 2 is broken, the agent clearly says so and hence is not able to give the refund. \nOP goes on to be rude and emphasise that he has done condition 1 already. He either did not understand what the agent was saying or was just being an rude to someone because he can.'
'No offers applicable on COD though.. :('
'Exactly. I suspect Zomatoes SM team is here trying to firefight this issue - if a customer is unhappy, refund. How hard is that to understand?'
"foodpanda is shittier..I've stopped using it way back."
"People these days applying the Indian tag to everything, which does't make any sense. There are shittier services in US that suck a lot more than Zomato. Yelp.com (the Zomato counterpart in US) is well known for their unethical practices like trying to extract money out of restaurant owners in exchange for removing bad reviews about their business (and those reviews are totally gamed in the first place)."
"This seems to be the restaurant's fault to me, though."
">Note : This happened only once in 5-6 orders placed. Generally Zomato's service is good\n\n\nThat's like a 20% failure rate. Not really good."
'>Live chat my ass.  \n  \nErr..'
"Swiggy is possibly the worst, it's really hard trying to reach their customer support via phone, they always send incomplete orders (has happened to me thrice) and charge the entire amount even for the missing items and don't care delivery the missing items back. If you on and compare prices of the same restaurant on foodpanda, zomato, swiggy you'll see swiggy charges you more. "
"No it isn't acceptable. They shouldn't have to contact the restaurant for a late delivery beyond a certain time.\n\nIf the restaurant hasn't confirmed delivery or updated ETA for the order they should initiate refunds. (say even after 1 hour when the delivery time is 30 mins.)\n\nThe whole payment issue is because of Zomato. Ordering directly from the restaurant doesn't involve your money being taken away."

"Kinda wish I grew up in a buying cd generation, but LP was all download for me. I was severely depressed when I listened to them. I would watch anime music videos of DBZ mixed with Linkin Park songs every night like some form of therapy.\n\nI would think of my situation and feel utterly broken, but listening to these songs made me imagine that someone somewhere else went through the same shit, wrote a song about it and connected with millions. So I pushed through, in a way.\n\nTrue, it was emo-listening. I don't know if the songs made me any stronger, but they fit the mood. \n\n\n\n"
'The only English music I knew when I was a child was lp. Was kind of young and could not understand the lyrics properly so got a hard print of entire lp discography .  Numb and in the end were the first ones that I listened to.  Meteora , hybrid theory and collision course have been the best albums hands down in there career.   Music that they made now was a kind of hit or a miss.\n\nBut there is no Linkin Park without chester.\nRip chester. Rip Linkin park.'

There used to be this inter-school competition hosted by Horlicks, called the wiz-kids. \n\nSo, during one of the competition the host was trying to kill some time and started picking out kids to sing on the stage. \n\nI got picked. I sang, "In The End". It was a big auditorium. I gave my hundred percent, and sang at my highest pitch for the Chester parts of the song. \n\nI am pretty sure all the people wanted to murder me at that moment. \n\nI was massively booed of the stage. Ah! Childhood memories. '
"FUCK. I'll miss him. In the end was the first English song I heard and liked. And I listened to Heavy just today. Everything sucks now. WHY????? :("
"What a sad news to begin my day with..For me he's one of those artists whose death really shaked me from inside;The last time the same happened was with MJ's death in 2009 before he was about to return with his tour & new album..I was awake late in the night to watch his funeral & it was very emotionally wreaking..\n\nBefore even i actively followed any western (or non Indian) artist, just like so many people i knew i 1st got aware of LP's music & at the time only listened to them because the music sounded Cool,without paying much attention to the lyrics & the meaning (just like with other artist's as well)\n\nBut as I've grown up i realise the meaning of these song's & in cases the back stories linked to them,& it made me even more of a fan of their act because i can feel myself connect well with the theme of their music because I've been through many same moment's in my life including depression, feeling of loneliness.. Etc.\n\nRight now on Last.FM ,Linkin Park is the no.1 listened artist worldwide..And i feel like jumping on the bandwagon to scrobble their song's as a tribute to Chester & maybe shed some tears as i recall the moment's of my life with their music from then to now..\n\nBut still sad by the fact that one of my favorite music act Linkin Park is no more..\n\nR.I.P. Chester Bennington\n\n\n\n"

"Linkin Park was one of the first bands I was a fan of, and they really were my gateway drug to music. I remember being in the carpool back from school one day, when a senior played 'Numb' on the music player. I thought it was the coolest song ever, and I went back home and immediately started checking out more of their stuff. I'm still having a hard time believing this extremely tragic news. And having faced chronic depression myself, I am so sad thinking about the pain he was in. RIP Chester. You'll always be loved and remembered. "
'Remember downloading Media player classic + K-Lite Codec + countless fake YouTube video downloaders over a 128 kbps dial-up MTNL connection for downloading one Numb video and giving my PC 976439 infections in the process. \n\n\nTotally worth it. \n'
'From listening Numb through a Dragon Ball video to learn all the lyrics of their songs. LP made my childhood better. So heartbroken right now.'
"Not my first English band but have had some deep connection w their music & lyrics since I was in 10th grade. I remember somebody in my family passed away just a day before my 12th board exams & I couldn't study a thing & it ruined my Physics test & I cried all night listening to em on repeat! That whole year was disastrous for me & their music was what healed me.\n\nhis music was an anti-depressant for people & now the same depression took his own life! ironic! don't think I'll be able to listen to them anymore as it'd always remind me of his tragic end."

"The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France if I'm not wrong; not the point, though.

We have farmers committing suicides, people dying of starvation and thirst and the priority of this government is to ban beef and build structures that will serve absolutely no purpose. The Sardar Patel statue is another example of a waste of money. I mean, would Vallabhaipatelji want us to spend crores building a statue of him? This is infuriating. This is what they're spending a huge proportion of tax revenue on. BC aaram se kitne ghar banjate.

'A key point that is not really discussed is that the argument "Churchill  was just saving the world from the Evil Hitler" is flawed.   \n  \nIn pre 1943 era, the world had no idea or information of the Jew extermination camps since these concentration camps were only discovered in the last stages of the war.  \n  \nhttp://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=136\n    \nSo by that logic, Hitler was not an (or should I say perceived as an) evil during and before the war. Enemy yes, but evil, no. In fact, he was just another leader promoting his nations interest, just like Churchill et al promoting theirs in India and rest of the colonies, since centuries.\n  \nOff-course, when the war was over and the world realized how big of an evil Hitler was, Churchill was labelled a hero who "saved" us.

I mean, I don\'t exactly remember churchill trying to destroy a race of people out of existence.\n\nEDIT: Ok, so he\'s making the comparison because "up to four million Bengalis starved to death when Churchill diverted food to British soldiers and countries such as Greece while a deadly famine swept through Bengal."\n\nSo it\'s not even about the war, it\'s about the policies enacted during war time that severely affected the people in this region.

"Congratulations and many cheers. Although, I have to ask you this question because it is imperative to know the thought process behind the decision. I believe the plot boundary starts at the edge of the drain which is visible on the right. So that is the land you own. Why then have you extended a ramp almost 5 feet outwards? Shouldn't the ramp end at the edge of your plot boundary since that is for your own personal use be restricted to the land you own? I don't mean to rain on your parade but this is a problem and has a cascading effect on the general layout and structure of a colony. Come road construction time, someone's ramp is sitting 3ft into the freshly constructed road and restricts the smooth flow of rainwater, not to mention the movement of cars when they pass each other."

'IMO the intolerance is due to the recent string of incidents after Arab spring and the wave of strife driven immigration from middle east and the resultant clash of culture often having violent ends. As a result of which people have started having a second opinion about accepting migrants in their country.'
'True. And amazingly put. But with one HUGE false perception.\n\nFirstly, you\'re an amazing person to make your immigrant colleagues feel accepted. A little local support in a foreign land goes a long way as a moral booster. Thank you /u/SquatchHugs And yeah, the close family ties are a thing not only in India, but the whole of Asia. And it\'s really nice to have family like that.\n\nBut you\'re so very humongously wrong about empathy. Empathy is an emotion that\'s largely ignored in Indian society. Very few in India are truly capable of having that emotion. I\'ll give a few examples;\n\nA religious mob breaks into a house and beats the father to death and seriously injures the son in front of their own family. All this only because they "suspected" that the family ate beef (cow is sacred for many Hindus). A majority of Indians justified the lynching with many even calling for killing the rest of the family for consuming beef. This was followed by a a dozen more lynchings in the name of cow and religion.\n\nA young student gets hit by a car in broad daylight on a crowded street. He\'s bleeding profusely and asks for help from onlookers. Nobody helps. He dies 4 hours later ON THE STREET.\n\nOrganisations openly responsible for massacre/pogroms/genocides of religious minorities are voted to power (One ruled for 60 years and another is currently ruling the country).\n\nWe wouldn\'t have have had Sati (the ritual of burning alive the widow of a dead man in his funeral pyre banned by the British in 1800s) or caste system (similar to racism and apartheid) if we knew what empathy was.\n\nNow there were a lot of people who protested against killing for cows (they were called anti-national traitors for supporting cow killers), who take the injured to hospitals, who actively support and profess secularism, who abhor the caste system, but these type of people are hugely outnumbered by the un-empathetic.\nAlso, lot of empathy shown by a lot of Indians have an ulterior motive. Like if a person donates alms to the poor, its more likely that he\'s doing it for karma than he actually caring for their well being. If a person is vegetarian it\'s mostly because he believes meat is unholy and not because he feels for the animals.\n\nAnd there\'s this huge group of Indians who actually strongly believe that Indians are genetically and intellectually superior to all other races and civilizations.\n\nPatriotism these days has turned into vitriolic nationalism. To the extent that recently a few physically disabled and elderly people were assaulted for not standing up when the national anthem was being played.\n\nMy point is, generalizing a population is dangerous and can lead to great evil (Remember the holocaust? Yeah, product of generalization). We Indians are as good or bad as anybody else.'

People everywhere are shit, but my point was that people everywhere are good too.\n\nEventually you get so jaded by how shitty the world is that you just learn to enjoy what you can, bud.

'That\'s a terrible ad. Also the reaction to that ad was a little too much. It didn\'t warrant that much attention. I don\'t think the Happydent ad would have received any criticism if it were released today.\n\nWhat I meant was that ads these days are all about the brand and less about the consumer. It\'s all, "buy me, buy me" now. Ads earlier were less in your face. And that\'s because clients want it that way, unfortunately.'
'The leaders who should take a stand, don\'t take a stand because if they do take a stand, then they stand to lose the client and with it the revenue. How are the leaders then gonna pay the employees? If one agency refuses to work with shit client and dish out shit creatives, there are 100 other agencies ready to lap them up. At the end of the day, it\'s also about business and how much money the agency is making. So that\'s the reason why the leaders don\'t argue or fight back as much. Because if you lose a client, you could lose your job as well!\n\nThis is an issue that the whole industry faces, but the industry will never come together to stop under-cutting one another. That\'s a whole different story.\n\nThe reason why advertising has been bland in the last 10 years, or specifically in the last 5 is because we live in an over-branded environment. The earlier times were simpler. TV, Print and radio were the only mediums. With the advent of internet, people\'s attention spans have lowered. So we don\'t see 1-minute ads these days, hell even 45-seconders for that matter. 15 and 20 seconders that are a cut down of 30 seconders rule the roost. So clients don\'t care for storytelling, they don\'t wish to take risks, they want to effectively use that 15 seconder to say as much as they can about their product and try and "convince" people to buy it. \n\nSo the blame can not be entirely put on leaders, a major reason for shit advertising these days is the because clients are looking at numbers, research results more than gut-feel and genuine likeability of scripts.\n\nThis industry is not going to last more than 10 years. It\'s already on its death bed.'

"Until you read this, you actually feel impressed. Then you go, oh crap he just doesn't understand how severe the problem is. The whole point of depression counselling is to not have subjective attachment to the depressed and openly listen to their problems. But he manages to talk about joint families which really many times are the first to hush up and/or cause and perpetrate depression. \n\nYea good job highlighting it at any rate."
"> Suppression of depression is not good. Expression is always good. If depressed, share your feelings with others, it will make you feel better,\n\nExpression is often the toughest for the depressed... and it's not right to even insinuate that depression can be cured just by talking about. Most depressed people have nothing to talk about/share about because it's a silent killer - you don't really know why are you even depressed or what is even going on... and that is where counselling or drug interventions come in \n\nI didn't listen to the Mann ki baat - did he talk about the ways of tackling depression? Psychologist/Psychiatrist/Counselling interventions? Because if not, that's just cursory mention due to the whole 2017 - Year of depression thing. Although I do appreciate the attention it will get - I am just worried about the myths related to depression that are propagated like talking at home solves all problems, etc etc.. depression is lot of times a complex disease that can only be tackled with the help of right amount of therapy, medicines and other strategies which may or may not work but are rarely handy at home.. it needs professional intervention"

But much like how Varanasi would become Kyoto, mental health is just a dog whistle to enrich babji's who are licking their lips.

">What is greatness if we aren't happy!\n\nI moved to India from Europe, and I love living here. I love the food, the music, the kind nature of Indian people. However, looking at how the country is run, how people are treating their environment, and how people are doing their jobs; it’s not that great. And people don’t seem interested in improvement. Sure, they complain, but they don’t do anything about it.\n\nOne example:\n\nIn Europe, if you’re a house painter, you’ve gone to school for 8 years to learn the trade. You’re knowledgable and you’re proud of the work you do. If you make a mistake, you work on it until the result is perfect, and your employer does not bill the client for the extra work. The employer knows that’s the cost of doing business.\n\nHere in India, over the past few years I’ve had dozens of ‘professionals’ work on my house. Painters, carpenters, masons, etc. They have no clue what they’re doing, they make a mess, they don’t clean up, they only work when they know you’re looking, every mistake is someone else’s fault, they don’t measure anything, nothing is level, they don’t do any planning, they damage materials and tools. They show up late, take long lunches, and they leave early. No-one has any pride in their work, they don’t take any responsibility, they only care about getting paid.\n\nAnd this is not just my experience as a Western client, natives are getting the same lousy treatment: in many houses and businesses I visit, window sills and door frames and door handles are partially covered with paint, because the painter didn’t take the doors out of the hinges or remove the hardware before painting the doors. Light switches are attached to plywood panels that are screwed into the wall. Tiles are crudely cut and placed askew. Nothing is straight, nothing is finished. The standard answer is “It’s easily cleaned or filled with putty”. But of course they never do, it’s someone else’s responsibility.\n\nWhen you have no pride in your work, the activity you’re spending >8 hours a day on, 6 days a week, of course you’re vulnerable to depression."
"I think a lot of it is because of life quality.\n\n\nOur cities are crowded, too much traffic, not many parks. For some reason there isn't much fitness culture or outdoor adventure culture like western countries. Our office culture sucks, when did staying 12 hours in office become the standard? \n\n\nFor rural areas, economic stress and lack of opportunities may be the reason."
"I'm sorry but meditation, and everything else you mentioned work for stress and they are preventative at best. I mean for people who develop issues without a particular reason like loss of someone etc. Bipolar disorder can be hereditary, your default setting then is to be depressed and have episodes every now and then. "

'Amazing how you can spin awareness on depression as a negative. Wah!'
'You might have a point, but don\'t knock on Yoga just yet. Yoga does seem to help people cope with depression. Some links:\n\n[Yoga for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23922209). Quote:\n\n> Despite methodological drawbacks of the included studies, yoga could be considered an ancillary treatment option for patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression.\n\n[Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20098228)\n\n> Although results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations. We would argue, however, that there are several reasons to consider constructing careful research on yoga for depression. First, current strategies for treating depression are not sufficient for many individuals, and patients have several concerns about existing treatments. Yoga may be an attractive alternative to or a good way to augment current depression treatment strategies. Second, aspects of yoga-including mindfulness promotion and exercise-are thought to be "active ingredients" of other successful treatments for depression. Third, there are plausible biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression. We provide suggestions for the next steps in the study of yoga as a treatment for depression.\n\n[Yoga for anxiety and depression](http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/yoga-for-anxiety-and-depression)\n\n> Many of the studies evaluating yoga\'s therapeutic benefits have been small and poorly designed. However, a 2004 analysis found that, in recent decades, an increasing number have been randomized controlled trials — the most rigorous standard for proving efficacy.\n\n> Available reviews of a wide range of yoga practices suggest they can reduce the impact of exaggerated stress responses and may be helpful for both anxiety and depression. In this respect, yoga functions like other self-soothing techniques, such as meditation, relaxation, exercise, or even socializing with friends.\n\nSome further reading:\n\n* "Yoga as medicine" by Dr. Timothy McCall for an enthusiastic review of the health benefits of Yoga. \n* The books by Loren Fishman who\'s an American doctor who prescribes Yoga for various conditions.\n* "The Science of Yoga" by William Broad for a highly skeptical but still positive review of Yoga.\n* While you\'re at it, also read up on mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn.\n\nThe books by BKS Iyengar, while it describes the practice of yoga from an Indian perspective, is not very much in alignment with science. Generally, I have found that Indian authors IMO tend to be unscientific in their portrayal of yoga, making absurd and unsubstantiated claims. The books by western medical professionals tend to be much more scientific and critical.'

That asshole promised to uplift the poor state of the nation. He is adding more than one could imagine. You have a wrong sense of economic growth ideas which has nothing to do with India at all. You want to see real development, look at African continent as a whole, China has literally adopted Africa like it's own baby by not putting them on huge debt but actually involving themselves completely to develop Africa on it's own and they have done it better.

If there is a genuine demand between Ahmedabad-Mumbai corridor, then we can just have a regular train.

"I'm increasingly getting convinced tat Hitler's idea that Jews were bad people.. Or rather bad for Germany wasn't wrong. He just went crazy and killed so many that he turned out to be the bad guy. \n\nOh also many scientists.. Even Jewish ones believe (with researched evidence) that the holocaust didn't happen the way it is said to have happened.. That there might have not been gas chambers and that the number of Jews that died was more like 1,1.5 million and not 6. Perhaps the Jews exaggerated everything for sympathy?! "

That would have been enough to fix that Police guy.\n\nI faced similar situation in 2012 with my Mom's passport. After RTI reply, I got a visit from that policeman who asked Rs.2500 bribe for verification, requesting to file for Passport application and he will clear verification as soon as he revive it.

"That was probably the last major conflict India will have for a very long time. The conventional war supremacy that India has now over Pakistan is so extremely high that they won't even try anymore. I'm talking about a conventional conflict like the one in Kargill.\n\n\nPeople often forget that Pakistan was actually considerably more developed than India until about the late 90s when India really started to pull ahead. They also had a legacy of US arms whereas most of India's weapons were from the soviets, so the Pakistanis had a better ecosystem of support(Russians are notoriously bad at servicing the arms they sell afterwards.).\n\nBut all that has changed. India's army today is much more modern, Pakistan is isolated from the US and the Chinese military isn't selling their best stuff to Pakistan anyway. Nuclear war won't happen.\n\nThe recent standoff between India and China is just posturing. This is a good problem to have but a problem nonetheless: how do you ensure your army is ready when nobody is willing to (seriously) fight you because they don't want to sustain the huge losses. "

There was so much patriotic propaganda and actual war footage shown that even the Pakistanis were impressed, especially considering the Pak TV media at the time still hadn\'t opened up like India had in the early-mid 90\'s. \n\nThis war also broke the myth of the "Nuclear shield". Pakistan army had been planning kargil since 1984 when the Indian army had done something similar( take over enemy fortified locations during winter). They only felt emboldened because of the Nuclear weapons and the threat to use them if India escalated the war. India did escalate it even if we suffered more in man power and equipment. Pakistan had to back down because of threats from the US and China about using nukes.  \n\nI personally found out how deeply involved Israel intelligence was in South Asia when they gave the evidence of Pak regulars doing the actual fighting against Pak ( as always ) claims of just "Tribals" fighting in Kargil.\n\nAnd the Bofors  worked pretty well.'

They also usually prefer to train the  country it is selling arms to in maintenance. If you look at the issues that are plaguing the Su 30MKI, it is not a Russian failure, but because HAL that is responsible for maintenance, is failing miserably, prompting India to sign a long term spare parts supply agreement with United Aircraft Corp \n\nHead to head, outside of ofc wars with the US, Russian equipment have performed admirably.\n\nOtoh, America is an extremely unreliable partner if you are not a NATO ally. Pakistan herself faced severe issues with America when  in the 80's it paid iirc $700 million for 28 F16 fighters, and then the U.S.passed the Pressler amendment. For no fault of Pakistan, the U.S. outright cancelled the delivery of these paid for fighters. It then added insult to injury by charging Pakistan for storage, while it lined up alternate buyers. It was only in 1999, that the funds were released back to Pakistan. Interestingly and as a sign of just how treacherous the US can be, from 1985 till 1989 the US did not apply / notify the amendment, as it needed Pakistani help in Op Cyclone. It was only in 1990, after the Soviets were defeated and the US didn't need Pakistan anymore was this done. It gets even murkier as, possibly the Pentagon was telling Pakistan that the planes will be released, so Pakistan kept making payments till 1993. \n\nPakistan never got those planes. They were instead sold to NZ. \n\nIn 2005, the US again announced sale of F16 to Pakistan, but as Pakistan clearly didn't trust the US and it is cash strapped, it went the FMF route. As of 2016, the U.S. Killed that deal also. \n\nI see the F16 dealings as a metaphor for U.S.Pakistan relations. When Reagan and the US needed Pakistan the most (early 80's), $3 bn in funding (must be $ 10-12 bn today) and a deal for 40 F16's was signed with great urgency. \n\nWhen the US need for Pakistan was waning after the success of Op Cyclone, the U.S.ditched Pakistan again. In the mid 90's, there was a thaw again, but that quickly froze up after 9/11, but opened up again when America needed Pakistan again. Now, the U.S is looking at India's vastly bigger arms market and again shunning Pakistan. \n\nThe U.S.is an absolute fair weather friend. The Russians, be it in sales or maintainence, are all weather friends. \n\nRussian kit in India, be they the ancient BMP's, or even more ancient Bisons, or the more advanced MKI's, the maintenance has been outsourced to India and the license to produce spares also given to India. Such a degree of control, the U.S.rarely ever gives to any non NATO ally. \n\n\n\n\n"

'>when you know exactly where they are\n\nThat\'s the problem. The military didn\'t know where the enemy "exactly" was, what concentrations it was deployed in, and the extent of logistical support it had. So the initial assaults were made without much arty or air support. But field commanders learned quickly from their initial mistakes and later assaults were made only after the peaks were plastered by arty and bunkers/logistical nodes destroyed by bombs dropped from the air. \n\nThere\'s also the issue of accuracy. Artillery fire is inherently inaccurate. It isn\'t designed to precisely take out small targets, but to saturate a large-ish area. So one can\'t effect small-scale fires in the mountains and hope to tackle an entrenched enemy. Air-dropped unguided bombs are also inaccurate. And in the Himalayas, a miss by a few feet is as good as a miss by a mile, because the bomb ends up not on the intended peak, but in an adjoining valley. You need precision-guided bombs to accurately take out targets, and the IAF had very few available for use at Kargil. '

The court, therefore, directed that a complaint against her be made through the reader of the court.\n\nDuring the trial, the court found her guilty of deliberately giving false evidence in order to convict her husband and family members, and awarded her a rigorous imprisonment for seven years.\n\nThough the public prosecutor demanded harsher punishment and submitted that she deserved no leniency as such incidents are ever increasing where women use this modus operandi to harass men to extract financial gains, the court took a lenient view considering she was a young woman and a first time offender.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'Fuck yes'
'Nice. This is a much needed step. Misuse of such laws not only affect the innocent, but also cause harm to those who genuinely need it. '
'amazing. as the judge was a woman she must have been even more pissed to see this person contributing to false rape stats and making actual rape victims go through more to get believed. this is equality.'
"> lenient view considering she was a young woman and a first time offender\n\nWould you afford the same leniency to a rapist? A false rape charge can ruin a man's life. "
'i wonder how close the 17 witnesses were to the accused... i can easily imagine a situation where an extended family would cover for, or at least be unaware of a sadistic husbands true nature. this is not a good news story. at best this is true and will discourage other rape victims from reporting '
'7 years is too much unless she got innocent people jailed'
'I have never understood this. Everyone in their right mind, male or female, knows real rape is heinous violent crime. The police will take it seriously and investigate, like they did in this case too. '
'The relation of the witnesses to the accused is taken into account in a Judgement, moreover defence witnesses can be cross examined by the prosecution to reveal inconsistencies in their statements.\n\nPersonal character of the witness is also given weightage. '
"You don't get convicted automatically when the accused has been held not guilty. There is another step where the court determines if you lied or not and it has to be proven in court that you lied before you get convicted. "
'She got 7 innocent people accused for a crime with max punishment of death and it seems the 5 were jailed for 5 years. '
"How's so? Do you mean just because she's a woman she should not be punished for trying to falsely convict 7 people and ruin their lives?\n\nAnd where did cow come into the picture? I'm pretty sure all the accused are human. Even accusing a cow of committing rape is too much of a stretch of imagination."
'5 of the victims were in jail for 5 years.That bitch must be hanged. She destroyed their career ,life.'
'If her accusation meant death sentence to the accused?'
'Brutality of non vegetarians is worse'
'Others were first time offenders too'
'> The police will take it seriously and investigate, like they did in this case too.\n\nThis is India that we\'re talking about. The police outside of the big cities are not sensitized to rape and never trained to treat rape victims properly. In a conservative society as ours, the police are known to ask uncomfortable "details" out of the woman. And let\'s not forget about what happens when the rapist is somebody influential in the village or town. \n\n> Everyone in their right mind, male or female, knows real rape is heinous violent crime.\n\nThis is debatable in the case of India too. Uneducated women actually end up thinking that it\'s their *fate*, and would never dare to complain for fear of bringing dishonor to the family name and other bullshit. '
'>The police will take it seriously and investigate\n\nIIRC, the two finger test for rape victims is still used in some places. It is exactly what it sounds like.'
'Fucking hell 7 years is too less. They obviously lost all their jobs etc. '
"But this will discourage other women from coming out and calling rape for dangerous things like a guy looking at her wrongly or whistling at her.\n\nDid you know that man and women are same? Just like women never rapes a man similarly it is possible for a man to never rape a women. Men rape only because **they're taught by their teachers and parents that it's OK to rape a women**. It is good that our feminist Agents like Madhui Dickshit is spreading this message.\n\nThe end game of feminism will be tested in multi-sex prisons where a hot young women who is awarded life imprisonment is kept in same cell as 5-6 men and those men will respect her not rape her. Then we will have true feminism."
'You shouldn\'t use only at the end of a sentence, as far as I know.\n\nSome examples of correct usage are:\n\n"I only wanted to use the car for two more kilometres!"\n\n"You can only use this library card for six months. After six months, you\'ll have to renew your library card."\n\nMy English is terrible so I may have made some mistakes.'
"No quite, for example accusing someone of genocide is not the same crime as killing and torturing 1million people. \n\nTotally different from psychology to severity. \n\nIt's not an eye for an eye, it's an analysis of the crime committed. And yes of course if the accusation would have made for harsh punishment for the accused then that is certainly factored in. It's a difficult thing to assess altogether. "
"But it didn't. Not every rape case leads to death sentence; it is very less. "
"The nirbhaya rapists got the death sentence because of their brutality and her resultant death, in this ase they wouldn't have even gotten a life sentence let alone death penalty, the death penalty is handed out to very very few people."
"You're pretty much mentally retarted if you even compare these two, one is a brutal rape and mutilation that led to the victim dying a painful death, the other is a case of ruined reputations. Are you saying both these cases require the same punishment?  "
'Yes, that combined with mental trauma to 7 people. Judge herself said she was lenient because the accused is a young woman and first time offender'

'Bullet Train is legit though.So is data mining for tax evaders,if done properly.Why do you club those two with a vanity project?'
"Bullet train is a vanity project. Mudiji admitted long ago that no one wil take the train, but he wants it as a symbol. Symbol of our misplaced priorities, maybe.\n\nThe economics just doesn't work out when the oroject requires 1 lakh passengers to travel between ahmedabad and bombay every day at rs4k/passenger. Its often cheaper to fly."
'That way any spending by this government is unnecessary. It is the use of Social Media for tax evasion which is stupid, and not the fact that this government is plainly incompetent, which it clearly is.'

How manipulated shit is that. They expect the people to do what they are told, without giving them the full picture. Because they assume Indians in India are stupid. That's the biggest myth they abuse on people. And expects farmers to stop farming and go industrial because they are easy peasy way for cheap labourers. That's what their attitude becomes sitting far away from ground reality."

I just don't get how such a small minority can elicit so much hate in this sub. It's ridiculous. "
"No, it's just the circlejerk that is randia. People on here bitch about anything and everything. All the problems in the world are BJP/Modi's fault and happened in the last 3 years only. Only randia know how to fix what ails India."
"It's almost as if that depends upon the things you are complimenting or criticizing for. If you compliment India for something stupid, all the realist will come down on you hard.

They don\'t really have a whole lot of friends and their english skills make them feel constantly embarrassed.\n\nSo they withdraw into a bubble of Hindu chauvinism, bigotry towards pretty much everyone and a weird nostalgia/pride about India.'
"That's actually not the case in /r/China. Most of the posters on /r/China are not even of Chinese ancestry, but are white sex tourists and labor migrants from the west who live and work in China. Its why the tone is usually extremely whiny/spoiled, and often racially aggressive, in many of the posts."
'> It really wouldn\'t affect them if they\'re integrated into whatever society they\'re in.\n\nOh, it does affect them. I am not talking about blatant racism, but people are going to have pre-conceived notions everytime you meet a new person in their country.\n\n> Finally choose to be optimistic or pessimistic, it\'s your choice but personally looking long term the pessimistic views are actually closer to ground realities and I would rather have these pessimists because they at least seem to accept that there are overwhelming number of issues over pointless chest thumping.\n\nSure, pointless chest thumping and being proud in something we had no hand in is bad. Denying reality helps no one. Nothing beneficial comes out of it. However criticizing just for the sake of cribbing and making blanket statements "India is never going to progress" helps no one either.\n\nI would rather be with an optimist (who is in touch with reality) than a pessimist.

'Somebody needs to come up with clean portable cheap "housing" for temporary construction workers.

'Only in r/india are people blaming the woman for having the kid. How about we confront a larger issue of access to birth control? I am going to go out on a limb to say this woman likely cannot read. So how is she supposed to know about ways to prevent pregnancy? Condoms cost money every time you use them. Also, like it or not, when you get married, the expectation is to yield children. Please tell me otherwise.\n\nOr we can just keep shitting on this person for not closing her legs.

">Maybe the kid will have a sad life, maybe he won't, but that's none of anyone's business. Human existence doesn't have purpose. People try to find a reason to live, to wake up every morning to work their asses off. For most people, family IS their purpose. It's always been this way and always will be because, from a biological standpoint, reproducing is the sole purpose of human existence.\n\nYou talk as if it's a 50/50 when the chances of him/her suffering are much higher than living a happy life.\n\nNo one is forcing them to stop having kids but for fucks sake think about their future.\n\nI mean I hear people in Reddit constantly wonder if they should have kids in their current economic condition and those people are far better off than the average poor in India.

Just imagine your parents lifting those bricks and starving for a day to feed you. It has an impact on most of them. \n\nAnd even if the kid fought his way and gets educated who will provide him a job? We are already seeing huge unemployment which will never be solved due to automation. The kid cant even fight his way out of poverty by educating himself anymore.\n\n>from a biological standpoint, reproducing is the sole purpose of human existence\n\nFrom a human standpoint, he wants to live at least a half decent life where he could meet his basic needs and have a reason to live. If the world cannot create jobs for these many people to come out of poverty than we must not reproduce.\n\nAnd I follow what I preach. I will never reproduce."

'Yes, good judgement. But how much will it help? Women will still cry rape.

She gets her revenge and goes home happy to find another bakra.'
"I'm guessing the logic is that uneducated girl's consent can be obtained by fraud but an educated girl's consent can't be obtained by fraud. "
"We have several businessmen, actors, political leaders and other achievers who have little or no education. How does uneducated equal stupid? If that's the case, uneducated women should not be allowed to vote or enter into a legal contract, because the law already believes that their judgement is impaired. If their consent in sex is not legally credible, how can their consent in other things be considered legally credible?\n\nThe whole point is that law is unfair and illogical. If the woman is an adult, she knows the consequences of sleeping with someone without getting married.\n"
'The rationale given was that there is a difference in the social norms among educated (modern/liberal/westernized) parts of our society, and the uneducated (traditional/conservative) parts. This seems to actually make some degree of sense, although I anticipate difficulties in establishing which sector a person belongs to. \n\nStill, the logic is not wrong. If two completely different societies exist, then the same act may mean two entirely different things to them. In the case of an uneducated girl, it could ruin her life and future, while in the case of a liberal westernized girl, it would be "a breakup", a possibility of which she would have been aware of, before entering an intimate relationship, given the cultural context. Basically, one side treats it like a serious commitment from the start, while the other is more wary. Backing out of a "deal" with the naive person would be considered cheating, while backing out of it with an informed and aware one would just be a fact of life.'
"I also believe women who lie with false rape accusation's should be prosecuted for doing so - otherwise It'll go on."
'I just feel the women who usually go to court after  such instances are the uneducated ones, not sure how much will this help.'
"Yeah, this is something I'm worried about too. The ruling makes logical sense overall, but categorizing someone into the educated camp is going to be problematic. It's not like there aren't any educated women who aren't traditional, conservative, and/or naive. "
"If it's anything like the west, not nearly as common as men actually raping women by a long way. And if it's anything like the west, they receive disproportionate media coverage."
"Uncommon with disproportionate media coverage + MRA so feels like 90% of cases of rape cases are fake (can't count the number of times I've seen this statistic in online comments, head hurts)"
'The burden of proof is always upon the prosecution (woman making the accusation). The reason for the near-ubiquitous charges of "he mixed something in my drink" or "he promised me marriage" is that lawyers advise those when drafting the initial complaint, because that implies violation of consent. More often than not, these are bogus charges, and impossible to prove in a court of law. The only evidence which withstands judicial scrutiny is medical evidence - which invariably isn\'t produced. \n\nThis is why there is an epidemic of false rape complaints in India, and a resulting low conviction rate. It doesn\'t, however, spare the man years of wasted life with countless court appearances. \n\nSource: I\'m a victim of a false rape charge myself, and my trial will end soon after 4.5 years of delays.

"Your comment makes 0 sense. 'Rape' is a legal term defined under Section 375 of IPC and various penal provisions in other sections of IPC. Court is deciding here whether the scenario in which the adult relationship occurred, comes under provision of Section 375 of IPC, that is rape. How is that interfering in relationship itself?"
"It will help because now women (including the educated ones) just need to prove themselves uneducated after filing a rape case and that's it. /s"
'Iirc this is not the first time courts have made this observation but abuse of law still continues'
"I don't think the problem in India at the moment is that men face too harsh a punishment for rape. Or that they are pursued too aggressively."
"Okay so I've seen this stupid retort countless times now, so let. E ask you this, how is it different from a male student falsely accusing a female for rape? Wouldn't that create all of these problems?  So should the said male student be barred from reporting rapes?  \n  \nHell this argument would be applicable in every single felony including me falsely accusing you of physically assaulting me. Everything will go through the same process.   \n  \nSo what's your solution then?"
"yes, but there's a basic principle in law, _ignorantia juris non excusat_.\n\nignorance of the law is not an excuse. i agree with the parent commenter that this ruling should apply to all people, and not just those taxed with the burden of an education."
'Am yet to see a politician raped. '
'I just feel the women who usually go to court after  such instances are the uneducated ones, not sure how much will this help.'
'This is a great idea, but every rape victim can be targetted when nobody supports her and 10 other men (and their already suppressed women folk) give witness that she was not even touched. Then she is both raped and punished by law for complaining.'
'Actually half of reported rape cases in Delhi are the parents filing a case in the event of intimate relationship gone wrong or a couple eloping.\n'
"First of all, my sympathies with you. I can't imagine what you just went through but hey it's almost over so thats good!\n\nSo it's less about getting the guy punished and more about destroying reputation and time. Gotcha!"
"Court shouldn't even entertain if the relationship was consent and should dismiss it saying the case is frivolous. If it's forced, it's a whole different story. "
'Yeah wtf is with "educated" why not any woman?'
"You don't think it is a problem when innocent men are aggressively pursued? Holy shit..."
"Prevent the accused in such cases from being named until the verdict is passed, and if they're found innocent make it required to provide that context. Make it a crime, so if the accuser names them publicly, they get punished for that.\n\nThere is no advantage to spreading around the image of someone being a rapist when they're found not guilty. We'd have a lot less problems with people thinking they can get away with it if they didn't see another story every week of someone accused of rape being found not guilty after the media shit on their reputation and provide interviews with old classmates who say 'eeeeh, he was always a weird one. Knew he would end up bad. Where's my money?'"
'*Rape is sex without free consent'
"Rape is not sex. It's sexual assault. Carried out against the will of the victim. By force or by threat."
'Lets keep discussion on educated girls for now. For a minute, imagine there are no uneducated girls in world. Will such a rule now makes sense to you?'
'Was She exposing navel?'
'This is why bjp-rss has no future in kerala'
'The aunty from mallu aunty porn feels betrayed'
'It has more to do with our sex starved male population rather than Sunny. In my home town hyderabad, whenever movie actresses are called for any shop ribbon cutting, we always see such crazy crowd. The numbers may change a little depending upon the popularity of actress. Many try to come too close, or grope the actress. No shortage of frustrated men in the country.'
'wtf man! how many died?'
'fuck right there on the spot bear ,so she forgot how she got there.'

"I'm sure most people would prefer that too, but just because you prefer it doesn't mean you should be ashamed of going home in an Activa. "
'You can take my said comment in a negative manner if you want. What I actually meant is - If your job gives you bread and butter, why feel ashamed ? Don\'t hide the fact that you work in McD. It\'s what you do. Ofcourse switch if you get a better opportunity, but don\'t feel ashamed. Coz you WORK. You are trying to provide yourself or your family. Feel proud.\n\nedit : "switch" not "switch off".'
"no no no no..she *has* to. This isn't negotiable. can't do it. You see, she should be embarrassed because she chose a man who was a better suit for her needs.\n\n\n\n/s "
'I mean how to physically get food in your hands if you are not willing to go out ever?\n\nAnd also, they gib no monies anymore. :('
'What the fuck is this sub?'
"Again, I only disagreed with the phrasing because of the negative connotations of worship.\n\nAlso it's never a binary choice between being ashamed of your job and being proud of it. There's a huge spectrum you're missing in the middle. It's totally normal to not be ashamed of your job and still realize that you could be doing better, or not liking what you're doing right now because you're stuck in a job below your potential. You don't really need to be proud of your job. Depending on your psychological makeup it might actually inhibit growth if you begin becoming to comfortable with where you are.\n\nSo to summarize, I agree you should not be ashamed of your job. But I disagree with the dogma that you should be proud of your job no matter what."
'You can call it bullshit but this is what the majority follows. There are always exceptions. And most importantly, it is all relative. Your 5/10 may be 10/10 to me. A guy I might consider too poor for my daughter may be a catch by another father\'s standard. \n\nThere are several examples of girls in my extended family who chose to marry guys from poorer backgrounds (all these girls were pampered, super-sheltered, NEVER faced any financial hardship i.e. idealists). After the honeymoon period is over, the idealism fades away and it becomes an unnecessary struggle when there is no easy way out of managing work/life balance, being not able to spend time with your child because you must continue working. The sweet guy they fell in love with has now transformed into a grumpy, bitter, unromantic, potbellied uncle (like 90% of all desi men do) but he is still broke as shit and still can\'t provide a comfy life for them. Now that is what I consider bullshit in the name of love. Love is a temporary emotion, sooner than later the reality kicks in  and then you are forced to start your day by looking at her ugly face that matches her true personality. \n\nI have fucked my share of fugly chicks, am good friends with girls who have "great/fun personalities". Just don\'t get carried away by emotions and marry someone who you do not find physically attractive. '

"Few days ago, I was watching the BJP campaign on a news channel when they accused the SP of hiring goons that blatantly perform crime against women in UP. He was asking why do families in Ghaziabad, Meerut, Saharanpur, etc. send their young girls to colleges so far in Delhi, are there no colleges in these cities? The answer he says is that SP goons are trolling over the colleges in these cities who blatantly assault girl students there. Don't know how much truth was there in that speech, but after looking at this news, it doesn't seem too far fetched."

'Yes. Large crime rate, poor administration etc. But by pretending to go against his father Akhilesh is trying to pretend that his dad was responsible for the all the bad shit that happened when he was the CM. '
"> Isn't it plausible the party with the biggest warchests would have bought out the very Yadavs that were once promoted by SP? \n\n\n\nWow, that's some conspiracy to somehow blame BJP for SP's actions. Your conspiracy could literally apply to just about anything."

"They cant. Thats why we people always find someone to blame, its the British,without them we would be world superpower, it was the Muslim Invaders, without them we would be superpowers. we make excuses for our position instead of working to better it. There's always someone to blame. Also we never learn in history that thorughout colonial history of India, Britain never held it without a large support from Indians."

">LOST THE WAR\n\nNo we wouldn't. At its peak, the USSR alone had more army divisions than all the Axis powers put together. Even at their weakest, the Allies had 3:1 air superiority over the Axis air forces.  \n\n>fucking killed EVERYONE IN INDIA, AFRICA, ASIA\n\nLol, seriously? After early gains against a weak opposition, Axis forces could barely hold their North African territories. And if Bengal wasn't in a famine, Indian forces could have fought back the Japanese army more effectively in Burma and SE Asia. \n\nIt's cute how so many people think Hitler was a supervillain who was *this close* to destroying the world. "
"There should be a thorough enquiry about Bengal Famine by Indian govt, to see if it was intentional. If it is then monetary compensation can be demanded from UK in the International Criminal Court.\n\nBut Tharoor's main intention is to save Congress party from the blame for current level of poverty in India."
'Lala Lajpat Rai would disagree with you.'
'Doubt most people in UK know who the fuck Tharoor is. It went viral in India only. '
"every commie is evil as per RSS, don't you know? evidently people know more about RSS than RSS itself."
'very true! it was only after the russians went to poland that such camps were reported. And, when the news went out and how brutal it was, no one believed it for a while.'
"Agreed. As I said, not defending him. My point is, after decades of Churchill being treated like hero there are people in UK who are ready to listen to Tharoor's point but I can't imagine where someone Indian or from SA can give a speech in India where they call Gandhi racist. "

'Tharoor is being evasive. Look at his next tweet:\n\n"I am angered that someone would exploit a human tragedy for personal gain&TRPs. I challenge him to prove his false claims in a court of law."\n\nNote what Tharoor didn\'t say. He said, "exasperating farrago". He could have just said a straightforward sentence "These are lies" instead. He could have just said, "I will sue you for defamation" instead of his weird challenge to the channel to prove its case.\n\nFor me, this raises more questions than answers. He is not being straightforward. Like I said, Tharoor is being evasive.'

In comparison British empire lasted from 1757 starting with the Battle of Plassey, to 1947 which is a span of 190 years.\n\n>  Maharashtra whose capital Mumbai is has a heavy influence of Maratha empire of past.\n\nYou are wrong. Bombay was handed over to the Portuguese in 1534 by the Gujarat Sultanate. It was the Portuguese that joined Bombay's 7 islands together. The city was given to the British as dowry by the Portuguese in 1661. There is no Maratha influence in Bombay as you claim. Shivaji never laid his foot in Bombay as it was either defended by either the British and Portuguese during his reign.\n\n>  So yes the renaming to CST makes sense.\n\nNo it does not.

You might believe that you belong to the majority but don't be so sure, this moment you might be one but the next you might find yourself in the minority on one basis or the other.  If even one kind of minority is at risk of being suppressed and mistreated by the majority, you can be sure that no matter who you are, no matter how conformist your views are, you're not safe either. Your day might come as easily as theirs did. Hate doesn't see reason or discriminate. \n\n It is this the duty of everyone, no matter their views to be very concerned with incidents like these and whichever kind of extremism that cause them.

'One should also remember how Russia helped us and the US gave pakistan all the support it could muster without looking like a villain.\n\n\nThe Blood Telegram\nThe Soviet Union sympathised with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war, recognizing that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in August 1971.[94]\n\nThe United States supported Pakistan both politically and materially. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger refused to use rhetoric in a hopeless attempt to intervene in a large civil war. They needed Pakistan to help stop Soviet expansion into South Asia in informal alliance with India. Pakistan was a close formal ally of the United States and was also on good terms with the People\'s Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a rapprochement and where he intended to visit in February 1972.[95] Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America\'s new tacit ally, China. Nixon encouraged countries like Jordan and Iran to send military supplies to Pakistan[96] while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the "genocidal" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by the United States Congress and in the international press.[52][97][98]\n\nThen-US ambassador to the United Nations George H.W. Bush—later 41st President of the United States—introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The following days witnessed a great pressure on the Soviets from the Nixon-Kissinger duo to get India to withdraw, but to no avail.[99]\n\nIt has been documented that President Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan.[100]\n\nWhen Pakistan\'s defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed Task Force 74 led by the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal. Enterprise and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle to the Bay,[94][101][better source needed] on her final deployment. Eagle was paid off by January 1972 at Portsmouth and was stripped of reusable equipment (radars and missile systems primarily).\n\nOn 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok;[94] they trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by the USS Enterprise task force in the Indian Ocean.[102][103]'

'I think a large part of the problem is that everyone seems to have their own notions of what the road rules are.\n\nOne of my favourite personal anecdotes is from Chennai. Was visiting family, and a cousin and I went out for dinner. On the way back home, we stopped at a red light. At the light, there was a car in front of us which had its hazard lights on. Thinking that the car was stalled or something, my cousin tried to drive around it when the light turned green.\n\nSurprisingly, the car in front also started moving once the light turned green (he turned his hazards off). We shrugged our shoulders and thought it weird, but hey! We\'ve seen weirder shit on Indian roads.\n\nThen the same thing happens at the next stop light. Now we\'re curious, and wait behind him. Sure enough, light turns green, hazards go off, and the car moves ahead.\n\nAt this point, we were dying to know wtf was going on. So at the next red light, we pull up alongside the car and wave to the driver. He was an elderly man, probably mid to late 50s. He lowers his windows and asks what we want.\n\nSo my cousin says its nothing really, just that we wanted to know why he keeps turning on his hazard lights at every signal.\n\nLooking very surprised and confused, he asks us what the hell are we talking about, and what the hell are hazard lights. We\'re both a little surprised by his answer, but anyway, my cousin clarifies by asking why the old man keeps switching on both his indicators at every stop light.\n\nThe old man gets pissed at us and starts shouting/lecturing, "Look at the state of the country today! They\'re giving licenses to young fools like you! Didn\'t you learn how to drive? If you want to turn left, you switch on the left indicator, if you want to go right, you signal right, and if you want to go straight, you use both!"\n\nWe were trying so hard not to laugh at this point, especially with the old dude going on and on about how we are spoiled brats whose fathers probably bribed officials to get a license and how he had to take the tests the old fashioned way and had to actually learn how to drive...you know the drill.\n\nHe drove off in a huff, presumably to go home and tell his wife and kids about these two dumb kids he met on the road who don\'t know how to drive. We, however, spent the ride laughing our asses off.'

'^From ^the ^article\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe economy under Modi\n\n### **India’s prime minister is not as much of a reformer as he seems**\n\n*But he is more of a nationalist firebrand*\n\nWHEN Narendra Modi became prime minister of India in 2014, opinion was divided as to whether he was a Hindu zealot disguised as an economic reformer, or the other way round. The past three years appear to have settled the matter. Yes, Mr Modi has pandered to religious sentiment at times, most notably by appointing a rabble-rousing Hindu prelate as chief minister of India’s most-populous state, Uttar Pradesh. But he has also presided over an acceleration in economic growth, from 6.4% in 2013 to a high of 7.9% in 2015—which made India the fastest-growing big economy in the world. He has pushed through reforms that had stalled for years, including an overhaul of bankruptcy law and the adoption of a nationwide sales tax (GST) to replace a confusing array of local and national levies. Foreign investment has soared, albeit from a low base. India, cabinet ministers insist, is at last becoming the tiger Mr Modi promised.\n\nAlas, these appearances are deceiving (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21723815-tax-reform-does-not-go-far-enough-land-and-labour-reforms-have-barely-been-tried-narendra-modi)). The GST, although welcome, is unnecessarily complicated and bureaucratic, greatly reducing its efficiency. The new bankruptcy law is a step in the right direction, but it will take much more to revive the financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks weighed down by dud loans. The central government’s response to a host of pressing economic problems, from the difficulty of buying land to the reform of rigid labour laws, has been to pass them to the states. And at least one of the big reforms it has undertaken—the overnight cancellation of most of India’s banknotes in an effort to curb the black economy—was counterproductive, hamstringing legitimate businesses without doing much harm to illicit ones. No wonder the economy is starting to drag. In the first three months of the year it grew at an annualised rate of 6.1%, more slowly than when Mr Modi came to power.\n\n**More an administrator than a reformer**\n\nIndia’s prime minister, in short, is not the radical reformer he is cracked up to be. He is more energetic than his predecessor, the stately Manmohan Singh, launching glitzy initiatives on everything from manufacturing to toilet-construction. But he has not come up with many big new ideas of his own (the GST and the bankruptcy reforms date back long before his time). His reputation as a friend to business rests on his vigorous efforts to help firms out of fixes—finding land for a particular factory, say, or expediting the construction of a power station. But he is not so good at working systematically to sort out the underlying problems holding the economy back.\n\nIndia does not just need power stations and parcels of land for development. It needs functioning markets for electricity and land—and capital and labour, for that matter. Lending to industry is contracting, for the first time in 20 years; Mr Modi should recapitalise state-owned banks and sell them off, to get loans flowing again. He should be working to simplify the over-exacting labour law, which perversely harms workers by deterring companies from hiring them formally. Property purchases are a forbidding quagmire; the government, at a minimum, should try to improve the quality of registers to reduce the scope for disputes.\n\nPolitical conditions are about as propitious for reform as they are ever likely to be. Mr Modi’s government is the strongest in decades. It has a big majority in the lower house of parliament and is edging closer to control of the upper house, as well. It runs most big states. The opposition is hopeless.\n\nThere are economic tailwinds, too. India is a big importer of oil; the low price of late has been boosting growth by perhaps two percentage points a year. Ageing has long weighed on Western economies and is starting to sap China’s. India, by contrast, is still young. Over a quarter of the people joining the world’s workforce between now and 2025 will be Indian. And there is enormous scope for catch-up growth: India is the poorest of the world’s 20 biggest economies. By rights, it should be surpassing others’ growth rates for years.\n\nMr Modi, in short, is squandering a golden opportunity. Some apologists claim that he is waiting until he wins a majority in the upper house before taking on bigger reforms. If so, he has given no inkling of what he is planning. In fact, he has not even made clear that economic reform is his priority.\n\n**More a chauvinist than an economist**\n\nAs prime minister, Mr Modi has been just as careful to court militant Hindus as jet-setting businessmen. His government recently created havoc in the booming beef-export business with onerous new rules on purchases of cattle, in deference to Hindus’ reverence for cows (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21723859-countrys-slaughterhouses-are-envy-rich-world-indias-huge-buffalo-meat-industry)). Yogi Adityanath, the man he selected to run Uttar Pradesh, is under investigation for inciting religious hatred and rioting, among other offences.\n\nThe fear is that, if the economy falters, Mr Modi will try to maintain his popularity by stirring up communal tensions. That, after all, is how his Bharatiya Janata Party first propelled itself to government in the 1990s. Mr Modi himself was chief minister of Gujarat in 2002 when rioting there killed at least 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. To this day, he has never categorically condemned the massacre or apologised for failing to prevent it.\n\nUnder Mr Modi, debate about public policy, and especially about communal relations, has atrophied (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21723888-narendra-modis-government-extremely-sensitive-criticism-indias-raucous-democracy-becoming)). Hindu nationalist thugs intimidate those who chide the government for straying from India’s secular tradition, or who advocate a less repressive approach to protests in Kashmir, India’s only state with a Muslim majority. One of the few media companies that dares to criticise the government has been raided by police on grounds that would not normally attract such heavy-handedness. Mr Modi himself has become the object of a sycophantic personality cult. The prime minister may intend all this as a way to keep winning elections. But it is not hard to imagine it going disastrously wrong.\n\nMr Modi’s admirers paint him as the man who at last unleashed India’s potential. In fact, he may go down in history for fluffing India’s best shot at rapid, sustained development. And the worries about a still darker outcome are growing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGuys, I am not a bot. :P'

"Can be two things.\n\n1. Water reached maximum capacity and overflowed. Maybe they called it breaking like how pregnant women break their water.\n\n2.

Our designers were building award-winning storylines and our lead programmer was dreaming of writing books.\n\nIt all went down the gutter when one moron on our team decided he wanted more than just porn vids and brought a hooker to the office, proceeded to get caught with his pants down, and almost had the entire team laid off. Night access to the studio was never restored after that and we just couldn't get our creativity running during the daylight hours.

What comes to us in the shape of mere bloodless policy may pierce into the very core of our life, may threaten the whole future of our people with a perpetual helplessness of emasculation, and yet may never touch the chord of humanity on the other side, or touch it in the most inadequetely feedle manner. Such whole wholesale and universal acts of fearful responsibility man can never perform, with such a degree of systematic unawerness where he is an individual human being."\n-------Nationalism : Rabindranath Tagore '

"> While Tagore was, without a doubt, patriotic, his notion of “freedom” was not simply political release from the British. He was wary of violent public movements, clearly understanding how these marginalised smaller players in the colonial state. Of these, Tagore was particularly critical of two: the Swadeshi Movement, and the rise of revolutionary nationalism.\n\n> The Swadeshi Movement, beginning with the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and continuing till 1908, targeted the economic stronghold of the British in India. Reacting to monopolies of production through which the British were able to sell Indians goods at highly inflated prices, a large group of people in Bengal chose to boycott foreign goods, instead preferring to buy domestically produced ones (swadeshi means of one’s own country, and here, by extension, refers to self-sufficiency). While this seemed an effective strategy of resistance, the movement failed to take into account the enormous losses that small traders, mainly Muslims, incurred as a result of this. Tagore’s novel, Ghare Baire (The Home and the World, 1916) is particularly poignant in its depiction of Muslim traders, harassed into giving into the demands of the public to burn their stocks of British goods in a highly spectacularised, ritualistic manner. When Nikhil, the well-meaning zamindar or landlord, widely considered Tagore’s mouth-piece in the novel, protests against the treatment of the traders living on his estate, he is branded unpatriotic and regressive.\n\n> The boycott of foreign goods was but a small part of a more disturbing turn in anti- colonial politics, the rise of revolutionary nationalism. Tagore withdrew from the forefront of the nationalist movement after an eighteen year old, Khudiram Bose, killed a woman and child by accident, in a botched attempt to assassinate the magistrate of Muzzafarpur, a town in the Indian state of Bihar. His horror of violence and the blinding irrationality that comes with it is portrayed through Nikhil’s antithesis in The Home and the World, Sandip. \n\n[Source](https://writersinspire.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/rabindranath-tagore-and-the-nationalist-movement-in-india/)\n\n\nSeems like he didn't approve of Swadeshi and violent freedom fighters."

'>  breeding non-stop\n\nI don\'t know man. The "Indians are breeding non-stop" is a meme which hasn\'t been relevant for years. India will reach replacement rate by 2020. There will still be population growth due to so-called "[demographic momemtum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_momentum)", but the die has already been cast and there is no turning back.\n\n>overstaying tourist visas illegally and expecting others to provide jobs\n\nThe amount of Indian immigrants who are illegal is a small share of their overall population. The vast bulk are skilled migrants who have done extraordinarily well. \n> You\'ll eventually get serious blow-backs like Trump and Brexit.\n\nBrexit was really a reaction towards Eastern European cheap labour displacing white-working class communities, not Indian immigration, which tends to be highly educated work migrants and/or students.\n\nTrump is a confluence of events, including loss of manufacturing jobs(which China, not India, is responsible for), rise of automation, illegal Mexican immigration and so on. The only Indian angle I can find there is possibly H1B visas, but that is only affecting a small amount of the workforce. It\'s a live issue, to be sure, but far less important than the 5+ million manufacturing jobs lost in the last 10 years alone, or the 12 million illegal immigrants from Mexico(and some other countries). \n\n> Better get yourselves strong\n\nIt\'s been happening for years now.

'How is it not pro-equality? If it brings birth-rates to par with that of the male birthrate, then is it not equalizing the playing field? It is both pro-female and as an eventual outcome pro-equality. fail to understand the outrage and semantics here.'
'We can start at individual level by refusing to take any dowry at all, and we can hope that it would be seen as an example. There will always be people who would want dowry and people who would pay it. Even if one person refuses it it breaks the cycle. Maybe many years later it would stop dowry altogether. We cannot control everyone, we can only control our lives. Let us start refusing dowry at our own homes first.'
"You're a negative phenotype aren't you?"
">If it brings birth-rates to par with that of the male birthrate, then is it not equalizing the playing field?\n\nAlthough it might equalize the playing field I don't agree with the solution, because it doesn't address the root cause and instead treats the symptoms. It is like trying to solve a leak in a tank by constantly filling it with water instead of fixing the leak.\n\n1. It is wrong on moral grounds. Either sexism is wrong, or it isn't. If sexism is wrong, you can't propose a solution which involves sexism. If someone murdered someone you love, and you murdered the murderer, our justice system doesn't consider you innocent because murder is wrong, regardless of who you murder.\n1. Your solution aggravates the problem rather than solving it. It far from removing sexism, it enforces ideas of sexism.\n1. The biggest problem with your solution, it doesn't address any of the actual issues. If anything, it diverts attention from the root cause and it gives the false satisfaction of solving the problem. It also gives men justification to carry on being sexist: Look at women getting special privileges. They must be inferior to us.\n\n>fail to understand the outrage\n\nBecause there was no outrage?"
"It won't. A child being born already affects the gender ratio. And it's not easy to get rid of a baby by then in urban areas. But it'll certainly give one less reason for people to be resentful towards their daughters."
"Countering your points:\n\n1. Education doesn't seem to be helping. If anything, the data trends show the better educated are richer (and vice-versa) and have access to procedures and information to selectively abort girl fetuses. Of course, some states have improved regardless, but this development is worrying indeed: http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/in-india-as-income-rises-fewer-girls-are-born-20106\n\n2. There are a myriad of laws. Let's take Dowry. It has been illegal literally as long as I can remember. Still persists. In fact, in some circles, it's become a way to show off your wealth that you can afford dowry :/ Ridiculous."
"\n>Learn to understand context man. I don't have a problem with people being pro-female, as long as those same people don't have a problem with people being pro-male.\n\nWho gives a fuck about your context when people have been burying newborn babies alive and aborting them left, right and centre? Your education, religion and even mudikakas scheme failed to get rid of this evil. So no, we do not care about your philosophical context, thank you very much.\n\n>The problem is that these people acknowledge that being pro-male is sexist (and they are right), however, the same people fail to acknowledge that being pro-female is also sexist.\n\nDoes it even fucking matter man? Are you the guy who worries how much you've polluted the world after you've flushed your shit? Being the pro-this and that guy you are, you better not flush and think long and hard (no pun intended) to dispose that stuff in a pro-green manner than just flushing and forgetting it."
'\nSo you\'re saying "it might equalize the playing field." So you do concede that it might help the birth ratio and bring it back to normalcy. So what is the harm there? Because baby boys aren\'t delivered for free? Here\'s some news for you: they\'re wanted and so people wouldn\'t feel that bad paying for them. Source: check out he birth ratios in many states. \n\nSo basically, it might help normalize the birth ratio but you\'re against it on principle then? Great! that means we can have open-and-shut cases then and court cases will be a breeze. Every case with the same crime will have the same punishment. No need to look at the circumstances etc! I\'m not sure if that\'s good or bad news for lawyers but that\'s basically what you\'re saying.  \n\nAnd you\'re arguing against your own argument here. You\'re against it based on the principle that it is a sexist thing and the root cause should be eradicated. Do you think it would have made more or less difference is babies regardless of sex were delivered for free? less, because the bias and preference is there. you need to tip the scales in favor of the marginalized so you need to add value to the marginalized part (in this case girls).'

We have this entire farce around gauraksha and gaurakshaks. Why don’t you send these rakshaks to take on the terrorists,” Thackeray said, while addressing a gathering of Ganesh mandals in the city.\n\nThese mandals are up in arms against various restrictions imposed by the state administration over how the annual Ganesh festivities in the state should be conducted, including sound limits to be ensured. In the wake of the terror strike against Amarnath yatris, Thackeray claimed that Hindus were being targeted in the country. “We are heading towards darkness. Festivals are small moments where we forget our troubles. But if you start imposing such restrictions trust me the Sena will not allow you to be in peace,” Thackeray said taking a swipe at the BJP government.\n\nHe also took a swipe at those who he claimed had been asking the Sena not to mix politics with culture and sports when it had opposed Pakistani actors and sportspersons. “We were told not to mix politics with culture and sport. But yesterday religion and politics were mixed and terrorists attacked innocent pilgrims. Do you have the guts to say the same things that you told us to these terrorists,” Thackeray asked.\n\nThe Sena has stated that the government needs to do more than plain lip service to rein in terror in Jammu & Kashmir. It has also stated the Sena founder, Bal Thackeray, had ensured a smooth yatra by threatening to disrupt Haj flights from taking off from Mumbai if Amarnath pilgrims were attacked. “The attack was not only on pilgrims going for the Amarnath yatra but on the entire country and the Central government. Merely condemning the incident will not suffice. It is time that this government does something concrete to give terrorists a befitting reply,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters in Mumbai.\n\nRaut claimed that the attack was on the entire nation and stated that Hindus of the country were felling targeted. Taking a swipe at the BJP, Raut said that the attack was proof that the surgical strike against the neighbouring country and the demonetisation move had yielded no results. “A permanent cure has to be found against Pakistan and its terrorist activities,” the Rajya Sabha member said.\n\nHe claimed that the Sena had tackled a similar threat to the yatra in 1996 with the party supremo Bal Thackeray threatening to disrupt Haj pilgrims from flying out of Mumbai. He claimed this threat had ensured there was not a single casualty. “Balasaheb had then publicly announced that if there was a single casualty by a terrorist attack during the Amarnath yatra, the Shiv Sena will ensure that not a single plane from anywhere across the country takes off with Haj pilgrims. The situation today is such that a similar stand needs to be taken now,” Raut said. Later in the day, party chief Thackeray said his party was still capable of carrying out Bal Thackeray’s threat.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

The Indian friends I have here and abroad are some of the best people I know. I am deeply saddened by this incident. It troubles me that these men were attacked needlessly by a hateful, ignorant man. His hate was intended for "Middle Easterners" - which is an atrocity of its own, and deserves an entirely separate post - but sadly, was directed at these two Indian men.  \n  \nAnd that is, in my opinion, the root of a lot of the intolerance in this country. People have absolutely no knowledge of anything outside of their small communities or lives. I am originally from the South (Mississippi and Louisiana).

"> I don't think that I'd ever been more scared in my entire life as I was inside the police station. There was something about the air that made it so. Robbers armed with sophisticated weapons would perhaps not appear as intimidating.\n\nIts nothing but psychology, based on the tons of bollywood movies we've watched that portray a typical Indian police cop as nothing but a goon in disguise.\n\nLast month, I came to Pune after a very long vacation and found an unknown unicorn bike lying in my compound. I inquired with neighbors and found that it was lying there since a whole week without anyone bothering to pick it up. Fearing the worst (maybe it was a stolen bike), I straightaway went to the nearby police station to file a complaint about the unknown bike. It was my first time, and like you, I was also very terrified before visiting there. What if the cops started asking me questions instead, what if they ask for money, etc.? But after giving some thought to the fact that I've done nothing wrong, I made up my mind and went there. Contrary to my expectation, they were extremely friendly folks! They asked me to go to my home and wait, and within minutes they dispatched two inspectors to my place who had a look at the bike, and asked me whether I had inquired the neighbors about anyone parking the bike there. The moment I replied yes, they unlocked the bike with a master key and took it away. All in all, it was a usual and mundane process, but this is Pune. I don't know how the cops are in other places. From what I've heard on reddit, etc., they seem to be very corrupt in north India."

'When your mom asks you why your room is not clean.\nme: I choose to be on a path of creativity, productivity and constructive work. Anything that isn\'t in alignment with that, I tend to ignore, sidestep and treat as a distraction. I believe that ignorance, non reaction and staying on the path of dignity is the best way to discourage any persistent unwanted intrusions. But Just like a nagging health issue sometimes ignored can turn malignant, this situation for me has unfortunately turned malignant. In case of the matter at hand, it seems the media has no intention of letting go. I don\'t see any grace in adding to this circus by testifying in defence of my character in a situation that I have no involvement in whatsoever. I have been dragged into a dirty perverse mess without a choice in the matter. This is something that is not of my making. The truth is, I have never met the lady in question one on one in my entire life. Yes, we have worked together, but there has been no meeting in private. Thats the truth Please understand, I am not fighting against an allegation of an affair. Or being childish trying to uphold a ‘good guy” image. I am very aware of my faults, I am human. I am in fact protecting myself from something far more serious, sensitive and destructive than that. Sadly, very few from the media or the public seem to be interested in the truth. This has been a hard-learnt fact for me. If the people are comfortable with a lie because it doesn\'t threaten their model of the world where a girl is the victim and the man the aggressor then so be it. I am ok with that too. Women have suffered centuries of abuse at the hands of men and it infuriates me how some men can be so brutal and they deserve the harshest punishment. But by that logic if it ordains that one man can\'t be vulnerable and one woman can\'t be a liar, so be it. I\'m ok with that too. An alleged 7-year long, passionate affair between two high profile celebrities with no trail left behind. No evidence, no paparazzi pictures, no witnesses, not even a memento in possession like a selfie taken at the alleged engagement which is claimed to have happened in Paris in Jan 2014. Nothing that constitutes an exchange or any sort of proof of a romantic relationship. Yet we want to believe the other party because the rhetoric is -why would a girl lie. My passport details show no travel outside the country in Jan 2014, which is the date that this alleged engagement supposedly took place. In Paris. The only so-called proof presented of this alleged "relationship", was a photoshopped picture in the media. This was immediately exposed, the very next day by friends including my ex-wife. These questions are not even asked, because we are taught to protect the woman, as we should. I myself have been brought up to think the same way, by my parents and the wonderful women in my life who have been my rock and support system. I\'m deeply grateful to them. I will do my best to teach my children the same values of family and dignity. And yes, I will teach them to stand up for women. Always. There are 3000 one sided mails which either I have sent to myself or the woman in question has sent to me. The Cyber-Crime Dept. can prove or disprove either story, in just a few days. Towards that purpose, I have surrendered all my devices including laptops / phones etc which are still lying with the cyber cell , but the other party has refused to do so. The investigation hasn\'t been closed. This is not, and I repeat, not a lovers spat. I humbly request people to stop labelling it as one and, for a second, try and see it for what it really is. I have been harassed by this for 4 years and the well meaning and probably necessary social bias toward women has deemed me helpless in defending myself. I am not angry, I have seldom allowed anger into my life. I have not had a single fight in my life, with a man or a woman. Even in my divorce, there was no fight. I, and those around me, have always chosen peace. I am not here to accuse or judge anyone, but it\'s time I defend the truth because when truth suffers the collective consciousness of society suffers. Civilization suffers. Closer to home, families suffer. Children suffer.\n'

In 2012, we had a similar situation: Maoists (367), followed by the North East (326), followed by Kashmir (117). The total number of victims of Islamist terrorism outside these three areas, across India, was 1.\n> \n> As is obvious, most terrorists in India are Hindus, the ones whom we have conveniently labelled "Maoist" instead of "Hindu". The second largest group of terrorists are the tribals, Hindus, animists and perhaps some Christians of the North East. Muslims are third. If one looks outside the separatism of Kashmir, their violence and terrorism levels are among the lowest in the world and they appear to be less susceptible to terrorism not just by the standards of the world’s Muslims but also India’s Hindus.'

The accused, son of a visiting IIT-Delhi professor, reportedly rammed his car in their motorcycle after the altercation.\n\nThe incident took place on Sunday in south Delhi when Gurpreet Singh (21) and his friend Maninder Singh (22), both students of photography, went out at night to shoot a documentary on pavement dwellers.\n\nAt around 1 pm, they stopped at a food joint near Safdarjung hospital\'s casualty ward. While they were eating, one man, later identified as Rohit Krishna Mahanta, stood next to them and started smoking. The accused was reportedly in an inebriated state.\n\n"The duo objected to the man blowing smoke on their faces and asked him not to smoke in public. The objection made Mahanta furious and he began to abuse the duo. The verbal altercation later turned violent. When locals intervened, Gurpreet and Maninder were asked to leave the place," an eyewitness told police.\n\nBut when the duo left the spot on their motorcycle, they were reportedly followed by Mahanta in his Ford Figo. The duo had hardly covered a distance of 400 metres when the accused rammed the bike from behind, also hitting an autorickshaw and a private cab in the process. Mahanta managed to flee the spot.\n\nBoth Gurpreet and Maninder fell. Passersby called the police control room and rushed them to the AIIMS trauma centre. Gurpreet succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. "Based on the complaint, Mahanta, a resident of Defence Colony, was booked. He was arrested and later released on bail," a police officer said.\n\nGurpreet\'s family has launched a social media campaign, alleging that it was not an accident but attempt to murder.

Laws don\'t apply to politicians or anyone connected to them.\n\nIn fact very soon the police will "find" old charges related to the victim despite the lack of any records, and he\'ll be vilified despite being innocent.\n\n3. This country has fucked itself up beyond sanity. And so has the justice system today.'
"Apparently he was released on bail because the victim hadn't died yet. After he died now police charged him with murder instead of assault. The murderer is himself in hospital so a constable has been posted there to arrest him when he is discharged."

There was a shortage of jobs, the currency had become worthless, and the government had to pay WWI reparations. Basically, WWI and the Treaty of Versailes, along with an inefficient democratic government fucked them badly.\n\nWhat Hitler did was introduce public work schemes to tackle unemployment, and encouraged productivity by offering cheap holidays so that workers were not overworked. He increased government spending in various industries to help reduce imports and make Germany self sufficient.\n\nIt is no wonder, then, that while many European countries and the US were badly affected by the Great Depression, there was no effect on Germany. In fact, unemployment fell at a rapid rate in the 1930s.'

"Very sensibly written post. One of the very few such posts i have seen on this sub, showing different perspective, instead of mindless bashing that takes place here daily.\n\nThere is one more such thread on twitter but its more from the religious point of view & by a non verified account so can't post it here, unfortunately."
'Ok 2 questions.\n\n1."gives them jobs"\n\nWhat kind of jobs ? If his followers are really employed, then why have they turned into goons in the last few days ?\n\n2.In your 4th paragraph, I think you are referring to crony capitalism fucking up the middle class and lower class of the society.\nWhen the south with all its crazy & corrupt identity politics and religious fanaticism (almost all the same problems as Haryana except the drugs) can still develop economically by embracing capitalism, what exactly is stopping Punjab and Haryana ? I have been to both these states as a tourist and the states had a feeling of carelessness / lack of enthusiasm for productive jobs that is so common in this part of the country (Bangalore). \n\nI appriciate this post, but I am yet to fully understand the core of the problem. Like who or what exactly is stopping the people from getting employed or getting out of poverty or oppression. There is only so much blame that you can throw on the politicians and religious gurus. I have seen similar dispair, poverty and laziness in states like UP and Orissa. If people are unemployed, they should either move to a place where they can get a job or start up their own companies in their places. I really fail to understand what or who exactly is to be blamed for the never ending poverty and unemployment of so many people in these states. Yes, gov is responsible, but its not their responsibility to get any individual jobs if that individual is not skilled or motivated enough. '
'People turn to drugs because of caste discrimination? Not sure I follow your logic.'
"These cults feed on the insecurities of the people, be it the downtrodden or the well-off doctors and engineers. These insecurities could range from not getting a square meal to not being able to birth a boy. The godlike figure provides 'benevolence' and the cult makes them feel like they are a part of something grand. \n\nI fail to understand how are we, the non-followers, responsible for the violence caused by these followers. If you say the societal problems forced them to become easy preys to such cults, then to some extent every individual shares a blame, for we all are a part of this society. But saying we are 'massively' culpable is stretching it too far. "
"Nicely put. May be we all really are culpable, some to more extent than others but that doesn't excuse or even justify the crime of rapes by Ram Raheem or killing by his followers in the name of dissent. "
'Forget the rapist, this is a real big social issue which needs to be resolved. these are the pockets where the Indian state is least visible. shows how much we need to work on social indicators and the need to frame policies which give real social dividends. '
'This is what I said of the matter in another thread (If you have read it, there is my opinion on this article at the end in italics):      \n\nThe problem is that Godmen are easily able to win over people which have the following characteristics:\nThey are economically just broke or not well to do.\nUneducated and deeply religious.\nHave genuine problems that are being neglected completely by the government.\nNow, if you look at the Dera Terrorists. Who were they? As reported, they were largely Dalits (oppressed), with little money, I don\'t know about their literacy level but they were definitely uneducated, deeply religious. Now, this area has a rampant drug problem. The Dera Human Rights Violation Camp runs a rehabilitation program and has helped many people get off of drugs, All these Godmen have some random philanthropist projects that starts the feeding system of their followers which makes some people deeply devoted. if he rehabilitates one guy from drugs, the entire family would be grateful to him forever. (They won\'t be if a doctor does it probably for lesser fees, but they will even sell everything for him). They will then tell others and the dhandha starts. Slowly they build a nexus. Now obviously, all this money is coming from somewhere. I am 100% sure you will find other activities in the Dera HRV Camp - drug smuggling, human trafficking, Arms smuggling and so on. Now they keep growing the empire and trust of people. The religious trust is so much that people will blindly do whatever the Pakhandi says, even vote the way he wants them to. So, the political nexus grows. WHen people see big politicians going to him, more of the people flock there and the cycle continues.\nLook at Ramdev. He started out as a yoga guru, then started talking about "pure" ayurvedic products which he fused with Modi\'s Make in India. Supported Modi, got huge land grants for free to build the Patanjali empire and now is taking out a music show or some such. Now, none of his products are made in India. They are all toxic products manufactured in China and are only packaged in India. Many of them are unfit for human consumption. Yet, people blindly buy them and worship this nauseus creature. When someone raises doubts about his products, he is called an MNC shill and shouted down with chants of "you are a traitor because you only hate Ramdev because he is making stuff in India and it endangers you somehow" without knowing a modicum of truth. Because of Bhagwa govt. no one will take action against him and the game continues.\nAnd its not just one political party, all of them do this. Remember Indira Gandhi and Bhindranwale? Now after 40 years, we are back a full circle. Unless Indian people educate themselves, this will continue. Now I am not saying that education will stop this because our dear country is full of padhe-likhe bewakoofs as well, but it is the first step.\n\n\n*Now, I don\'t care whether they take guidance from a rapist or food from a murderer, however, nothing in the world gives them the right to burn property or fire shots, hurl stones or fling lathis. Even a 10-year-old child knows that and that is wrong irrespective of how you feel, how oppressed you are or how angry you are. Even a person under threat for his life is not spared by law for killing his attacker.* \n\n*Also, this is not the only time these guys got violent. They became violent in Jat Andolan also. This was not a show of anger, that can be expressed by peaceful protests as well. This was a pure vengeance to cause loss to people who had more than them under an excuse of "faith". I understand their oppression and the drug problem and the pseudo-philanthropist work the Dera Human Rights Violations Camp does. However, none of that warrants this behaviour and none of that should soften anyone\'s opinions about these people.    \nThey are adults capable of thinking and it doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to know that this kind of terrorism is wrong. All of these are also the problems seen in terrorists radicalised by Islam but should they be the basis to show them any leniency when they carry out violence? No.*\n\n*I agree that the government should reach out to the underprivileged people more, they should be more invested to help solve social problems and not let Deras do it. But colouring this violence in any colour other than home-bred terrorism and sedition is just wrong and emboldens more riots in the future. These were the people who said "Bharat ko kat denge tukdo mein." on television. That behaviour from anyone irrespective of caste, creed, colour or religion should not be tolerated. We are Humans first, Indians next and only then a hundred other things and every single person should remember that.*'

"> You literally can't talk about dera sachha sauda violence without discussing why deras were created in punjab and how their role and warped and changed over time. There's no point to being 'horrified'.\n\nGenetic fallacy. \n\nIt doesn't take alot to condemn a convicted rapist. If these people were oppressed then they should have been better able to understand the oppression that the victim went through. They should have been able to understand the agony the families would go through, whose property they burnt. If gaining sympathy was their aim, then by engaging in orgy of violence they have lost mine. "
'I was waiting for how this moral ambivalence of Lower Caste people spreading mayhem will be solved. Great job Ms. Kaur. They can do no harm ladies and gentleman, the class guilt always points in the same direction.'
"The premise of the article is that the Dalit Sikhs are joining these deras due to isolation.  Even Dera Sacha Sauda's actual Sikh followers are a minority.\n\nSecondly, are the deras converting the people to Sikhism?  I don't think so either, they're just building their base.\n\nDrugs? oh come on, that's just a weak point. It's not just the Dalits that use drugs.  Why is the central government blocking the drugs at the Pakistan border?  Everyone knows they make their way from Pakistan to Punjab.\n\nOther thing, are these offshoot deras by themselves the problem?  Or are we all mad that the Ram Rahim, who was the leader of the dera,  was convicted of rape? If the government bans these deras, then there would be talks of fringing upon religious freedom."

'>  we forgot that development, as understood by very rudimentary economics, is unfair, unjust, unequal, and problematic. If nothing else, this should serve as a lesson. If we try to climb up by stepping on someone else\'s broken back, those people will rise.\n\nDon\'t try to blame "development" for what is happening right now. The problem isn\'t development, the problem is Hinduism as it is practiced by many in India. There have been many countries that have undergone "development", and while there have been some people who have been treated unfairly or unjustly in the name of development, the problem today is because of the notion of caste is so ingrained in Indian minds. There are too many Indians who justify stepping over someone because of their caste, and this has nothing to do with development, or how it is carried out, but have everything to do with religion. \n'

Without fixing our bureaucracy and the perverse incentive structures, calling for universal healthcare is just an empty slogan which will only empower the corrupt doctors.

"'these lower caste people yaar they do such things' narrative has started off. How easily we disentangle and disengage from violence that doesn't benefit us. How conveniently we absolve responsibility.\n\nPeople don't realise how deeply entrenched caste is in Punjabi society. I visited a Jatt Sikh village and a Mazhabi Sikh village last month on the same day. And the contrast was stunning. It's a lesson for anybody who doesn't think poverty and inequality in this country are aligned along caste lines.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThe riots that we have witnessed today weren't in support of a rapist, but for provision of basic needs. \nThis difference is really important and needs to be recognised. Yet again, poverty, poorly implemented government programmes, corruption, a capitalist government and illiteracy have failed the nation."

"Okay, here we go with corrupt doctors again.\n\nPoliticians, bureaucrats, police, media, lawyers and defence officers rank much higher in corruption than doctors. Doctors in India are the 7th out of 9 professions studied for corruption  (the 8th and 9th being project managers and artists) and the rate of corruption in doctors in India as actually marginally less than the corruption in society in general.\n\nThey are working 120 hours a week for pay per hour less than a factory worker, without sleeping for 36-72 hours straight, having proper food or water, under constant stress, seeing 100-150 patients a day and under depression or anxiety disorders, being beaten by patients, pushed around by politicians and without any safety. Don't fall for the Amir Khan inspired media TRP bashing of doctors. Most of them are in hell.

Stayzilla might fold and the founders might move on. But the dues to the landlord and the vendro can't simply be written off by them. They have full legal right to pursue Stayzilla. However the lax system acts against the landlord and the vendor as well.

Bangalore has slightly better law enforcement than other states(better than Mumbai, I have stayed in both cities).\n\nInstitutional inefficiency is also another reason.

'Not newsworthyNagaland Post\n\n---\n\n>* While Nagaland was plunged in turmoil since January 28,2017 and resulting in the tragic deaths of two youths on February 1, the entire Indian mainstream media did not find it news worthy enough to even give a one-line mention the terrible tragedy.\n\n>* Nagaland has been under shutdown for four days and it was only  on February 2, that the deepening crisis that spilled over to breakdown of law and order, found some mention in one electronic media.\n\n>* It may be reminded that when the then Naga hills was burning and people herded together and various inhuman atrocities were perpetrated by armed forces; the national media turned a blind and deaf ear to the crimes and the cries.\n\n>* On the other hand, the national media gave more importance to a road accident somewhere in a metropolitan city than to the incidents that had been taking place in Nagaland for four days.\n\n>* It is unthinkable that in an age where technology and connectivity rules, the national medias unresponsive attitude to the happenings in Nagaland for four days makes it appear as if the state was somewhere beyond the blue.\n\n\n\n---\n\n^I\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^"delete" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme'
"Indian media is not reliable, they mostly cover places where they can access. Most media houses ignore non-Hindi speaking locations.  They don't even cover news with keeping their personal biases out of the profession.\n\nWe don't really have a lot of money to invest in North East. There will be very less return on investment. It's landlocked and sparsely populated. Most private companies won't open the offices there.\n\nModi once talked about the 2nd agricultural revolution in North East and Odisha. I don't know if anyone has time and money for that, but it will bring a lot of benefits if money is spent in agriculture in places where industries can not be setup and there is surplus water.\n\nIf money is unevenly invested, it will create huge immigration crisis and build massively populated cities.  Poorer states will become source of insurgency and bring instability to the entire country. "

That's a problem in itself too. But the complaint that this is being ignored is absolutely unfounded."

'"Chink" was a derogatory word used by White Americans for centuries to refer to Chinese immigrants living in the US. Despite the fact that Chinese labour was essential to the building of key American infrastructure (like the Transcontinental Railroad) and to industries like gold mining and fisheries, many Whites felt that the Chinese were a threat to their way of life - the "Yellow Peril", as they put it. Like today, many politicians blamed the Chinese for depressed wages and lost jobs for Whites, and anti-Chinese sentiment reached incredible levels - despite the Chinese themselves generally being good workers and residents.\n\nAs a result of this, the Chinese were treated atrociously, including mob violence, destruction of Chinese suburbs and businesses, massacres, media propaganda, legal discrimination (like the Chinese Exclusion Act), lack of citizenship, inability to own property, unfair imprisonment, deportation, and more. This was the period when the term "chink" became popular, and it was every bit as bad as the term "nigger" from the same time period.\n\nThe term survived and because popular again later during the Cold War. The rise of the Communist Party in China led to the Chinese being marginalised again in the US. Chinese became the objects of suspicion, especially during the McCarthy era, and were often discriminated against and victimised socially and officially for this reason. In addition to this, American soldiers often used the term to denigrate their enemies during the Vietnam and Korean wars.\n\nThe Indian term "Chinki" comes directly from this, via the British. The term was used in Britain for some time as well, in a similar manner. Indians picked it up from their racist British rulers during the colonial period. So yeah, there is quite an awful history behind the word, and it should not be used.'

'Pointing out the obvious makes no difference to some people still whining about a private business organization taking commercial decisions. News channels are only a mirror to the society in which they function. Blaming the symptom instead of the cause is just pointless.\n\nBeing part of a union does not justify getting shafted. The way things work, underperforming states get rewarded while the Southern states get punished for their competence. That is a very legitimate complaint.'

I asked where in the RTO, he said go find out. You are the offender, go figure for yourself.\n\nEdit: Mind you, I was alone there was no pillion, and I was wearing my helmet when pulled over.

'A summary of what happened as mentioned in the article:\n\n– The video starts when ROG_AK hands over the car to service advisor and tells him not to polish the car from inside. He also reminds about the petrol smell issue. After this, owner leaves.\n\n– The car is taken inside the service center\n\n@57 seconds, just as the service advisor is reversing the car into the service bay, you can here one person shouting ‘washing washing’. To this, the service advisor shouts back ‘the customer is still in the service station. let him leave.’ After this, the two start talking which is not relevant to ROG_AK’s car.\n\n@1.45 the service advisor as made sure that ROG_AK has left the place. They now move the car to washing area. The person on the phone you see, is the service manager. All is happening in front of him.\n\n@ 3:53 the car is waiting in line at the washing area. There is a person in the car, who says he is feeling hot and turns the AC to the lowest temp and max fan. ROG_AK says, “I myself have never used the AC at full blast! The car is sitting idle for several minutes with the AC at max speed. When I first watched the video I though they might have been vacuuming the car but I realized later that this was the sound of the AC because the sound is there almost throughout the entire washing process.”\n\n@ 11:17 they notice the dashcam. But are not sure if it is recording or note.\n\n@ 14:11 this is the first time the bonnet is opened, to clean the engine bay.\n\n@ 15:23 Lunch time. Mechanics use the car to eat their lunch. (WTF!)\n\n@ 18:32 Mechanics and cleaners are doing time pass inside the car. Service advisor tells them to get out of the car as camera is recording.\n\n@ 18:45 Car leaves washing area to be parked in the delivery area. The driver of the car asks service advisor, ‘is this car not serviced?’ There is no reply.\n\n@ 21:34 Car is getting its final clean done\n\n@ 25:49 Formalities done. Driver told to deliver car to owner.\n\nSo as you can see the car never went inside the workshop again for any kind of fluid checking or inspection whatsoever! They didn’t even pull out the dipstick and check the oil level! To make matters worse they blatantly lied and ticked all the boxes in the manual. – ROG_AK\n\n\n'
"As an owner of 2 automobile dealerships i feel so bad this has happened. But sadly it is the truth with Maruti dealerships from what i hear being in my line of business.\nI personally inspect my workshops at least twice a day, have CCTVs installed which i can monitor anytime and specifically have employed a service manager whose sole job is to make sure shit like this doesn't take place in the workshop."
"hyundai did the same to me. My father insisted to have it serviced at the Hyundai agency. The alignment was completely off.

"Good is too subjective a word to be used in this circumstance, because, although we must condemn her brutal demise, we cannot readily assume that she had been candor in her ways, for she had been convicted once I believe.\n\nFurthermore, there are tens of hundreds of journalists being murdered in the same way every year in this country who, also deserve such coverage in the media, but donot because they weren't communists like her.\n\nHence I believe the celebrities like Prakash Raj are fighting a justifiable fight, that maybe good for people who support her, but may not be good for those who don't.

Unfortunately, Prakash doesn't realise that the PM was brought up in an organisation which distributed sweets when a defenceless old man was shot by a terrorist.

"Radcliff was given only a month to draw the borders for east and west Pakistan. Other than chatting with Nehru and Jinnah, he knew jackshit about India, specifically which side had what or where there's a majority for this and that.

In the end, after playing ludo with borders and realizing the shitty work he had done, he destroyed all his papers before leaving India, exactly the same way British did.\n\n"
"The partition was a vile act, a crime against humanity. \n\nI've grown up with stories from my grandparents about what they went through, chased out of their homes by militias, having to trudge through the monsoon muck, surviving raids, living in putrid camps before being herded onto trains, on which were just as likely to be killed by mobs on every station as reach safety. \n\nI cannot understand why the partition was kept such a secret. Why wasn't it announced in time, population transfers arranged systematically in advance. \n\nThe only reason that I can think of is that the British wanted the partition to be as devastating as it was. Both, to have their parting revenge on the Indian nationalists who had humiliated them - especially Gandhi and his assaults on British Civilisation. Perhaps they also wanted India to collapse under the combined pressures of partition, the challenge of integrating princely states, and the communist insurgencies going on in many places. \n\nThis would have given them an opportunity to 'return' to India, and maintain some proxy states. \n\nIndians nowadays just do not understand the enormity of the multiple crises during that first decade. Most of it has to do with ignorance, but a lot of it is due to the hypocrisy and thanklessness of the ruling classes today. But for our founding fathers, they wouldn't have had a nation they're so fond of criticising on every opportunity today. \n\nBut perhaps some Indians wanted the Republic to fail, with it the Congress. Perhaps they could thought that was the only way they could grab power, in smaller 'Hindu' states - becoming new Brahmans for new kings. \n\nThere are so many questions about that era, so many doubts. And so much ignorance. But some agendas need to be revealed. "
'Never forget to acknowledge the determination Congress leaders showed to unify India. Else we would have been still in war with fellow Indians of other states for petty reasons'
"It doesn't get spoken much, but the partition of India was disgustingly mishandled. The drawing of borders was a farce, with no real time given by the British authorities to the likes of Radcliffe. Indian politicians are themselves to blame, with Congress' attitude of being all and end all of all political parties and sheer opportunism on the part of the likes of secularists like Jinnah who played with people's appeal with religion and made Direct Action Day possible., with the sole purpose of destablising India in the face of chaos everywhere.  And partition and violence wasn't simply restricted to Western India and Bengal, even till date the scars of partition live on in the North East of India too, which got deprived of its entire economic connectivity via Chittagong etc. \n\nIn fact, when the Indian politicians are directly responsible for the chaos in the late 30s and 40s, what little can the white fools do? Our own leaders are largely responsible for the shit and misery that people on the peripheries and borders have had to suffer since Independence. \n\nThat said, it's a surprise to me, how the North Indian hold over Central level politics hasn't spurred off major rebellions in the South yet. There are genuine grievances that people have across the region, that and a resurgent China and rise of thumping in certain belts might ensure that in a few years, when droughts and climate change and falling yields in the face of little availability of water become a reality, when chaos reign again like it did 75 or so years ago, then these White rulers and their apologists get the chance to cheer the downfall of India as we know it since 1947.

'In a first, south Delhi colony gets drinking water from taps – The Indian Express\n\n---\n\n>* On Sunday afternoon, a residential colony in south Delhis Malviya Nagar became the first area in the capital to get 247 access to potable water from taps.\n\n>* Done under a public-private partnership with French company Suez, the scheme was implemented by isolating Navjeevan Vihar hydraulically and following the calculation of losses, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials said.\n\n>* As part of the project, a leak detection mechanism has also been put in place, and losses at household levels, checked, said DJB chairperson Kapil Mishra.\n\n>* No water pumps will also be required and hence power consumption will be reduced. The inauguration of the scheme saw Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti and Mishra underline the initiatives importance in bringing Delhi closer to developed countries.\n\n>* Stating that while the pilot project might look like a small step, Mishra said the scheme will be replicated in other parts of the capital, which has already been divided into 1,010 units.\n\n\n\n---\n\n^I\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^"delete" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme'
'People in this thread are confused about what "drinking water straight from the taps" actually means. So let me shed some light.\n\nMost people in Delhi already get treated tap water. If you are living in a legal colony in Delhi then the water you are being supplied is fit for drinking (or it\'s supposed to be!) This is not what the article is about.\n\nWhat they have done here is different. If you only get water for few hours a day, then you must store that water in overhead tanks, so you can use it for the rest of the day. Since most overhead tanks are made of cheap plastic, and they only get cleaned only after a few months, the water stored in such tanks is not safe for drinking. What people do is either they store the drinking water in separate containers (pots) and use tap water for other purpose, or they simply install a water filter which then treats the water coming from the overhead tanks.\nBut now the Jal Board is providing constant water supply for 24 hours a day (in the colony mentioned). This has two benefits.\n\n* First, you no longer need tanks and since the water coming is already treated, you also don\'t need a water filter. Just drink straight from the tap.\n\n\n* Second, constant water pressure is good for pipes. When water is supplied at the scheduled time, there is sudden change in pressure inside the pipe. If there are any leaks in the pipes (which there almost always are), water is leaked through them. But what\'s worse is that when the supply is stopped, the sudden decrease in pressure causes external dirty water to enter the pipes, hence contaminating the entire line. This change of pressure also reduces the life span of pipes and they start rusting and the rust then mixes in the supplied water. Constant supply of water solves that problem.\n\nThis is pretty much the standard in most of the developed world. And hopefully, it will be implemented in India as well and won\'t just remain a "pilot project".'

'Hey, thanks for the question. I wish I could dig some journals for you, but I lost my university time bookmarks and the zotero file, so here comes some memory dump.\n\nElevated water towers are beneficial as they help decrease load on the pumping systems, stabilize pressure in the distribution network, increase network\'s reliability (e.g. surges), and also tides over any emergency needs i.e. electricity outages, pump breakdowns, fire fighting etc. They are also cost efficient.\n\nNow the problems with Indian system is that, the elevated water tanks nearly always operate at breakdown levels i.e. ~25% of total storage capacity, because either we can supply it to consumers or we can pump it to the tank. Believe me, when you use incompetent construction companies engineering/planning takes a backseat. Their storage capacity is also extremely inadequate to the connected distribution system. Due to electricity supply issues, the pumps to the tanks more infrequently, which reduces their life expectancy too, adding to unnecessary costs, totally negating benefits of the elevated storage where one of the benefits is reduced pump costs. Timely maintenance is never done on these tanks, and the depth of these tanks just keeps reducing over passing time due to silt. This means that they are nearly useless as they cannot maintain pressure, and ground contaminants enter the pipes. Underground water supplies are notorious and there will always be leakages, and leakages are a two way street. Second thing is these elevated water tanks do not have any engineering brain put in designing them, and they have dead mixing zones where "old" water never mixes with fresh water. Moreover, the chlorinated water from the treatment plant just sits in the tanks, wasting the efficacy of the chlorine treatment. Considering the density Indian cities and towns have, these overhead water tanks are just a blight on the water planners. Canadians have tried perfecting the tanks over last 20-30 years, but we are still stuck in RCC era. Elevated water tanks are not bad systems, but in Indian context they have been rendered extremely useless. In west, you can shower on the second floor easily, but in India good luck using a shower. One tank is serving water several times over its hydraulic limit, as babus keep extending the distribution network. They never add tanks, but fucking pipes because supplying water is important, it does not matter if it is for even half and hour per day. Intermittent water supply is a health hazard, and hence this 24/7 supply is welcome. \n\nIn a nutshell, lots of western municiplaties use elevated storages, but with strict limits on pressure and connections per storage etc. But as you in India, we don\'t engineer things. So it is better to use water boosters with ground level pumped reservoirs in India. \n\nVery disjointed post, but hope you can grab something from it.'

This was immediately exposed, the very next day by friends including my ex-wife.\n\nThese questions are not even asked, because we are taught to protect the woman, as we should. I myself have been brought up to think the same way, by my parents and the wonderful women in my life who have been my rock and support system. I\'m deeply grateful to them. I will do my best to teach my children the same values of family and dignity. And yes, I will teach them to stand up for women. Always.\n\nThere are 3000 one sided mails which either I have sent to myself or the woman in question has sent to me. The Cyber-Crime Dept. can prove or disprove either story, in just a few days. Towards that purpose, I have surrendered all my devices including laptops / phones etc which are still lying with the cyber cell , but the other party has refused to do so. The investigation hasn\'t been closed.\n\nThis is not, and I repeat, not a lovers spat. I humbly request people to stop labelling it as one and, for a second, try and see it for what it really is.\n\nI have been harassed by this for 4 years and the well meaning and probably necessary social bias toward women has deemed me helpless in defending myself.\n\nI am not angry, I have seldom allowed anger into my life. I have not had a single fight in my life, with a man or a woman. Even in my divorce, there was no fight. I, and those around me, have always chosen peace.\n\nI am not here to accuse or judge anyone, but it\'s time I defend the truth because when truth suffers the collective consciousness of society suffers. Civilization suffers. Closer to home, families suffer. Children suffer.'
'So BC he didnt even get to stick his dick in crazy?\n\nBte ye Kangana is making a chutiya out of all of India and we\'re lapping it up\n\nCaught parts of a recent interview. She was whining about how bad she had it and how she had to "sleep on the streets"\n\nLike literally\n\nYeah bc. A pretty girl from a decent background was so broke that she had to sleep on the street. '
'Someone give me a tldr of what this mess is all about?'

"Wow! I had no idea he was so well spoken. Somehow I concocted an image of him as a douchebag in real life over the years. Seems like he is a genuine person. But anyways that's just one side of the story. "
'The biggest problem of India is why would a girl lie. \n\nThousands of such fake claims of affair, molestation, dowry & even Rape come up every year just because some greedy girl want to make easy money or get attention and the laws of this nation support it.\n\nThe worst thing is, even after the fake claims are exposed in court no action is taken on such women.'
'What exactly are they fighting about?'
'Both are retarded as fuck. Nobody gives a damn about these bollywood actors and their nauseating drama. Hrithik is no saint and Kangana is no innocent victim either. '
'Guys, please stop fanning these mediocre actors. \n\nRetake Roshan is arrogant enough to assume "collective consciousness of society suffers" and "civilization suffers" only because he\'s feeling it now. No, civilization suffers when it mistakenly decides to elevate massive egos like yourself and her on a pedestal; our collective consciousness suffers when your narrow problems become everybody\'s business. '
'The lawyers have also asked a few valid points:-\n\n1. Hrithik was never outside the country in Jan 2014. Kangana claimed he married her in Paris. Forget Visa or passport log which says he was in India... does she even have a selfie with him. By god... she got married the first time... she couldve atleast taken a selfie right?\n\n2. She claims Hrithik or his nerd tech team hacked her account and the mails were fraud. But in the mail her daily routine is mentioned, plus the friends she meets. How come Hrithik or his tech team know about her daily whereabouts?\n\n3. Hrithik submitted his phone, ipad, laptop etc last year. Kangana didnt. She said her phone fell in the pool. And laptop has gone for repair.'
"This whole thing is getting stupider day by day and all this is getting traction because of 'feminist'-centric world we live in right now. I get it, woman have been harassed and ill treated for long but not every woman has. \n\nI seriously don't understand why people get on anyone's side in this case, if there has been an issue / affair / fight between them there is absolutely no reason to harass him publicly and try to gain public sympathy without proper reasoning or proofs about this. If she really is a victim and wants everyone to help her she needs to do more than just talk and expect people to believe. \n\nSadly woman claiming to be illtreated gets an instant 'I believe her' thing especially when the opposing party comes from a good / wealthy family. There is that instant hate trigger against rich. \n\nP.S. : I am not on team H or team K, I care less to be on anyone's side. I am the side of 'stop being sorry of either', if they have a problem let them settle their own shit it has nothing to do with you me or anyone un related to them."

That was the principle the world worked on. Indian warring states throughout history have done the same. Most of this present angst is because we can't come to terms with the fact that the Brits were better than us in empire building despite  no lack of effort from our own Indian rulers.\n\nTharoor's answers are plagued with half truths (we contributed 27% of world GDP) and  essentially works out to 'We wuz kangs and shit' spoken in a posh accent."

'This is in a way, coming to terms with our past and looking towards the future by not making the same mistakes.\n\nIn reality the old white masters have been replaced by brown masters and nothing really has changed as far as the system is concerned but at least this also shows Tharoor as an Indian the common population can look up to and aspire to be, at least for some of his qualities, compared to the barely educated, cunning assholes that come on the telly, voted into power by the people, claiming to be national leaders. I see two major uptakes from this.'

'On a per capita basis Europe already had the highest in the world. This was important for war making as a nation can only spend at most the difference between there income and what is needed for survival on war. Hence if your gdp per capita is 1000 usd per person and you need 500usd to survive at most you can only use 500usd per person whilst if your gdp is 550usd per person you only have 50usd per person to use for war so even though the difference is only a factor of 1.9 or thereabouts it translates to a difference of a factor of 10 per person.'

"Well, it's not so simple is it? One must ask what the Gurkhas, pathans, baluchis and sindhis doing there? Indian troops from far and wide fought for two hundred years in Afghanistan for the British. Each province was captured by using men from another. It was a proven tactict. In British India, anyone not holding a gun was a legitimate target. There were rebellions by troops from time to time, eg the mutiny of 1857 which was a very important event. 100000 Indians died in that war fighting each other. It came to be known as divide and rule. And then people say they united us."

The idea as to not let another rebellion occur -- where Hindus, Muslims and people of all walks joined in. \n\nBy studying the social psychology, culture, norms and flash points, the caste system was institutionalized (which previously was more fluid than today)\n\nBtw, most conquerors legitimize their loot as such: But the natives were fighting anyway.

'Most riots start because of small things. Even recent saharanpur violence started like that. It started because a guy from Rajput community got killed.\n\n>The tensions between Hindus and Muslims had been running high since the kidnap of a Dalit girl by some Muslims in March 1980. The Dalits and Muslims used to live in separate bastis (colonies) near an Idgah. The girl was later rescued, and her kidnapper was arrested. In July, on the day of her marriage to a Dalit boy, some Muslims obstructed the marriage procession complaining about loud music near the mosque. The argument soon escalated into a violent clash between the two communities, followed by looting of several houses.[4]\n\n>On 13 August 1980, a domesticated pig from the Dalit colony strayed into the Idgah during the Id prayer. Around 50,000 Muslims were attending Eid Miladun Nabi prayers at the location. The Muslims, who considered the pigs as haraam, believed that the pig had been deliberately released by the Hindu Dalits.[5] They asked an on-duty policeman to chase the pig away, but he refused to do so, leading to a heated argument. *The violence broke out when some Muslims pelted stones at the policemen.[4] The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) collapsed when a stone hit his forehead, and the Additional District Magistrate (ADM) DP Singh was dragged away by some people; he was found dead later. The policemen then started firing indiscriminately into the crowd. The police force was reinforced by the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) troops that arrived in trucks along with the District Magistrate.[6] Several Muslims were killed in the firing; about 50 more lost their lives in a stampede that followed the firing.* **The Muslim leader Syed Shahabuddin later compared the firing to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.**\n\nComparison to Jallianwala Bagh , did this guy even know anything about those brave hearts. It was an insult to those innocent people sacrifice. Even in article it is mentioned how muslim leader used his post to help people from his community with a clear inter of malice.\n\nEveryone blamed RSS  for it as always but results from investigation went in RSS favour. Blaming RSS for every riot is like calling every muslim a terrorist. \n\nMumbai bomb blast , Congress tried to cover that terrorist were from minority communities.\n\n'
'ban RSS? when the present incumbent is its proud member?'
'It is already banned in r/india '
'> Are people actually being killed for transporting cows?\n\nYes. Not even transporting, even being "suspected" of transporting them. Even if you\'re doing it completely legally. '
'There have been cow slaughter bans in many states for varying number of years, even decades.\n\nWhile the bans themselves are religiously motivated and were put in place as way of appeasing high caste Hindu votebanks for political gains,  such a ban would be unconstitutional if put in place for that reason, so  politicians figured out round about ways to implement the ban.(Not very different from Trump\'s way of implementing his Muslim travel ban.)\n\n Initially they claimed it was put in place to help boost the dairy and farming industry.. which relied on these animals and faced shortages. (This argument no longer holds water  sincefarming has become modernised/mechanised and we have a surplus of milk production now.)\n\nBut even in states which had instituted such bans, they only targetted young cows. Oxen and buffaloes and even older cows were not covered by such ban. And the implementation of the ban too was quite lax.\n\nBut since 2014, when the BJP (A right-wing Hindu nationalist politcal party) swept to power with an independent majority at the centre.(A first for them and only the third party in Indian history to achieve it.) they have been toughening up these laws in all the states where they control the govt.... making the existing  bans more comprehensive, extending it to oxen and imposing stiff criminal penalties for even the possession of beef for personal consumption. And they have also encouraged the formation of vigilante "gau rakshaks" (cow protectors) who are sometimes even funded by the state government to take care of cows but they mainly thugs with political aspirations using this as an excuse to harass and settle scores with  non-Hindus and lower caste Hindus.\n\nSo there have been many incidents across the country of these vigilantes beating up people and in some cases even killing them. And the police instead of arresting them, tend to focus their investigations on the victims. In one prominently covered case, where a Muslim man was murdered by a mob, the cops sent the meat found in his fridge for DNA testing.\n\nAnd this month the central government notified a nationwide ban on trade of cattle for purposes other than farming. The reason is supposedly to prevent animals from being sent for ritualistic torture in neighboring Nepal, but the language ensures that no one can trade in cows/buffalos/camels for meat. (This is again a twisted way of imposing their religious agenda on the country.. .since the central government cannot impose such bans since under the separation of powers this is a state subject, but they are using the excuse of cross-border trade to issue this notification.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'

">The left sees Trump’s executive orders on immigration as pure Hitler behavior. That gives him plenty of room to negotiate to the middle. The initial orders are too broad, and clearly target too many of the wrong people. As he fixes those special cases he will be moving away from the Hitler model toward the middle. And people are more influenced by the DIRECTION of things than the absolute position of things. As long as he is moving away from the Hitler analogy, people will chill out, even if they think he was too close to that position before. Direction matters.\n\nJust read [this post](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/156532225711/the-persuasion-filter-and-immigration) \n\nThis doesn't sound very biased to me. You might think he is explaining Trump's actions with a bias but I see it more as analytical. He could be wrong about his analysis, but he's been saying this all along and he's being proven right. The speculations he puts forward are working out as he is predicting them. In that I see an observer and ***not*** a supporter *or a* critic.\n\n>Are Trump’s temporary immigration plans chaotic? Yes. Do they hurt innocent people who were minding their own business? Yes, temporarily at least. Did he scare the pants off of half the country? Yes. Will there be lots of unintended damage from Trump’s immigration orders? Yes. No honest person should deny the cost component of the equation. It’s ugly. But don’t stop with a half-pinion. If you want a full opinion on immigration you have to compare those costs to the potential benefits that include fewer terrorist acts and avoiding Europe’s refugee problems. Are people making that comparison? \n\n>No.\n\nI again find this part purely analytical. Perhaps even academic. \n\nSometimes it might be hard to weigh the positives vs the negatives of actions and results, because the negative is just too inhumane and immediate to ignore (the 'flip the switch and kill the people on the other track instead?' problem). But anybody could tell you that we *need* to weigh the positives vs the negatives in most existential situations.\n\nI'll read more of course but I suggest you watch the podcast where he can explain his view and we don't have to draw opinions just from his posts and tweets.\n\nedit: https://youtu.be/NJCJpmUAy0s?t=572"
'The whole thing reeks of bias.\n\nThat sounds totally like a white supremacist justifying their racism.\n\n"So what if there are costs. Look at all these benefits"\n\nSee the same arguments made for demonetization too.\n\nAlso Europe doesn\'t have a refugee problem. Syria does. Calling it Europe\'s problem gives away the whole \'white man\'s burden\' vibe. '
"> He conveniently doesnt address Trumps business conflicts, the nepotism, or just how dangerous it is to have Bannon etc around him.\n\nThis is again because he is not commenting on that. He is talking of his strategy more than the reason. \n\nScott Adams after reading 'God's Debris' became one person I follow from time to time. \n\nWe could try and detach ourselves from implications of Trump and perhaps sometimes think of ***ways*** of Trump. That's what Scott Adams is commenting on. That gives us ample room to talk about a personality and cult more than it does of its immediate implications which might be (in some lens) agreeably gloomy. \n\nSpeaking of that aspect, which I mention, gives us insight into why people like Scott Adams (and Joe Rogan) can be perceived and in some sense are defending a buffoon's antics."
'>"So what if there are costs. Look at all these benefits"\n\nRefugees migrating in *big* numbers to societies and cultures in a short period of time have far reaching impacts over a long time. Proper procedures *to scale* should be set-up to transition them into the culture where the majority is *very* different. Cultures migrate and merge but that takes time. Decades. This is (combination of numbers and cultures involved) unprecedented in modern times and we really don\'t know the costs, as you say.\n\nAlso. There are \'racist\' people on this earth. That\'s a FACT. You can\'t just wish it away. You can\'t just assume they will adjust to an influx of an alien culture. You can\'t wish their \'racism\' away. It is also an animal instinct. A tribal instinct. It is deeply rooted. And we should advance  towards a better more accommodating nature, but we can\'t do it by sweeping generosity sadly.\n\nAs far as demonetization goes, same arguments were made. And once we saw that the hoarders seem to be getting away we should realign our arguments and say that such a scheme was bound to fail. It needed top-notch efficiency and enormous planning. Which was not possible. That doesn\'t outright make the scheme bad (ignoring the academically economic implications which could be bad, but is not relevant to this point). Similarly, with proper checks and balances put into place first, the immigration could be handled in a better way. And Scott Adams\'s point is only that Trump is looking for wiggle room - not that he is right or wrong; people are not talking of the other side with each other. Just one.\n\nI fear that with quick judgement people pass these days, you\'ll label this comment as racist, apologetic or some sort. And so.\nDisclaimer: it is purely arm-chair analytical.'
'The visa policy in place did not foresee an en masse migration. Also Trump is over reacting to come at a middle ground which makes the immigration policy more stringent than it is. He is a shrewd businessman playing to the audience. He promised jobs with sights on immigration. He is trying to achieve campaign, business and perhaps even some (arguably) misguided nationalist role. \n\nWe will be ignoring his other motives if we were to concentrate only on his racist angle to it.

"IKR. I don't understand the rationale of people arguing that it should be made legal for both sexes, in order to quickly dissolve marriage. That is what legal process is for. We need to speed up process of divorce, instead of letting such practices sustain."
'Opposing Triple Talaq is not in interest of society.\n\nCourts have time and again repeated that a person should not be forced to live in abusive relation. Goverment too was ready to bring IrBM law for making divorce easy for incompatible couples. In fact many times Supreme court has decreased the 6 months waiting period for granting divorce when it found that the marriage was already dead.  So making divorce difficult will go against the modern thought of lowering barrier to divorce in dead marriage. Rather it would have been better if rights similar to triple talaq are given to every married woman and man of the country. If necessary the name may be changed to Triple Divorce or something that does not make it sound religious. But no one should be forced to live with abusive spouse.

"The Woody Allen scandal was a farce brought on by a crazy Mia Farrow. Daughter was clearly coerced by her and the medical investigators agreed. The marriage to his long term GF's stepdaughter is weird but not all that creepy once you find out they had no real interaction until Farrow asked Allen to start hanging out with her when she was in her low 20's."

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**BJP sees cow in people’s fridges, plates but not on streets eating poly bags: Sisodia** \n\n ______ \nThe recent lynching incidents in the country, especially the Ballabhgarh case in which 16-year-old Junaid Khan was killed and three others injured, dominated the Thursday discussion at the Delhi Legislative Assembly.\n\nDelhi Assembly passed a resolution urging people to “uphold the Constitution in letter and spirit” and condemn incidents of lynching in the name of “Gau Raksha.” The BJP insisted that the House pass a resolution stating that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The AAP leaders accused the saffron party of trying to divert attention from the real issue.\n\nDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The BJP can only see cow in people’s fridge and their plates. Why can’t they see cow’s roaming in the streets of Delhi, eating poly bags and meeting with accidents? Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes abroad and hugs several people who eat beef but in India those who eat beef will be killed?” Sisodia said.\n\nHitting out at cow vigilantes, AAP leader Alka Lamba said, “There have been reports of the so-called Gau Rakshaks eating beef and even BJP minister Kiren Rijiju does so. BJP leaders have said that they will not ban beef in poll bound north-eastern states like Nagaland for vote bank. This is greatest form of hypocrisy”\n\n“When we ask from PM to take action all he says this is country of Mahatma Gandhi. Why can’t he assure safety of minorities,” she added.\n\nAround two-hours of the second-half of Delhi assembly session dominated around this issue with AAP leaders targeting PM Narendra Modi of inaction and double standards and condemned “the mindless violence being unleashed across the country in the name of religion.”\n\nSuspended AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan said, “Why is the loyalty of one community being questioned? Did they commit any mistake by not going to Pakistan after partition?”\n\nDuring Sisodia’s speech, tempers ran high and there were dramatic exchanges between AAP MLAs and BJP legislator Manjinder Singh Sirsa over Kashmir.\n\nSirsa asked AAP MLAs to pass a resolution stating that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, even as AAP leaders accused him of trying to divert attention from the issue.\n\nSeeing this, speaker Ram Niwas Goel intervened and said, “Why no one talks about the part of Kashmir that is still with Pakistan? The government allows 42% of import from China but spends time with talks of Swadeshi. I have also served the RSS for 40 years. But today I am pained. Hedgewar or Guru Golwalker would not have thought of what is happening today. Mansarovar yatra has been stopped, China is staring down at us and we talk of patriotism.”\n\n“I pass this resolution that Kashmir is integral part of India,” he added.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
"What I have observed is that even the opposition leaders are shit scared of directly confronting the issue of lynchings. Why can't you just say that people should have the right to eat beef regardless of their faith and nobody should get lynched for it?

"As I've said many times - the secular, tolerant image of Hinduism is a very, very modern thing mainly due to the reforms of people such as Raja Rammohan Roy.

Alongside the status, the user shared a photo of a trader\'s cash receipt which had the same words \'kamal ka phool hamari bhool\' written at the bottom.\n\nAll the user did was highlight the fact that the receipt in question had these words printed and what they could possibly mean in context to the current government. The Facebook status read as follows - "Kamal ka phool hamari bhool. Vyapari apne cash memo par print karva kar janta se bata rahe hain ki BJP ko vote dekar galti ho gayi".\n\nFacebook\'s act of banning the user for 30 days has sparked outrage on social media as there does not seem to be anything violent, abusive, racist or sexually explicit in the status in question. Many people are taking to Twitter to express their shock and disbelief at this move on the social networks part.\n\nIt does not contain a rape threat, no abuses, no death threat, no racist stuff - of course it is agnst FB community standards. Post those. - Purva Agarwala (@ppurva) September 27, 2017\n\nMany are also questioning whether the post was banned because it presented a negative image of the government in power. The irony being here that the user only pointed out something written in a trader\'s receipt and did not even express any personal opinion.\n\n@facebook hosting it\'s servers in the gallary of the establishment.

This behavior is difficult to explain and what if Google too was made to follow? is it Facebook or is there something even uglier behind the scene? Does this rhyme with its mission of "Giving people the power to build community and bringing the world closer together."? This is dilution of freedom.

I can't simply claim that it was due to the politics rather than breaking site rules (a la The_Donald).\n\nOR, he might have been reported too many times by triggered bhakts.

'My 2 cents on people who think that people back then had it easy\n\n*  Education was a privilege back then. People were not aware with acutely limited access to information. There was NO Internet!\n*  Society was still socialist with no consumerist mindset, which meant lesser jobs.\n* No local production equated to low local consumption. Barring a few industrialized cities ( Kanpur, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai .. etc) no small or medium scale industries, meant very low motivation/opportunity to start a business\n*  Financial Illiteracy - People still hoarded cash\n*  No credit cards and easy accessibility to loans - EMI EMI EMI - that is how you bought your latest iPhone.\n*  Grave degrees of Nepotism and favouritism preferred over excellence - you got a job only when you knew someone which meant that 90 out of hundred had a harder time.\n\n\nThe above being said, about the post from OP gives just 1 fact and makes a lot of assumptions about 1980.'

He kept insisting for about 5 minutes that I have the apple and I kept refusing, my refusal getting more vehement as time passed. \n\nFinally, he realized that I did not take the apple because I was skeptical of taking food from strangers. He made a face and started eating that apple in front of me in an exaggerated manner just to show that the apple was fine. \n\nAs for the groping bit, a female friend of mine faced harassment when she was sleeping on the upper berth.

"Extremely one-sided. I'm a feminist girl myself, but the amount of sexism against men is confounding. \n\n-In cases of adultery ([Sec 497 of the IPC](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1833006/)), the woman under *no* conditions, whatsoever, is punished. In fact the un-married/ married man she has an extramarital affair with is criminalized. It is a non-cognizable, non-bailable criminal offence which can get you in prison for upto five ears. A married man who has extramarital affairs will undergo similar conditions. \n\n-Alimony. Alimony is almost impossible to deny to a housewife who has never worked, and to one who has left her job on getting married or when she had children. It is possible to not have Alimony paid to a working ex-wife, but it isn't impossible to [get alimony in these cases either, for the wife](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Earning-wife-cant-be-denied-alimony-Court/articleshow/48258551.cms). The cases in which the ex-husband gets alimony isn't a foreign concept either, but is comparatively [rarer](https://blog.ipleaders.in/divorce-maintenance-alimony/). They only happen in cases of mental/physical or financial instability in the man. \n\n-I'm not completely sure about this, but I know that harassment laws against men in a marital relationship aren't great, or are completely non-existent, and rape laws against men in general in our country are a load of horse shit, so Marital rape is probably a laughable concept to the legislative and judiciary. \n\n "

The question is what does this mean and how is it measured ? The way that this is measured is that they take a convenient location in the city and measure particulates - SPM for example. \n\nIn Bangalore one famous spot to measure SPM is Majestic Junction. It's SPM levels routinely reach hazardous levels. The thing is that Majestic is a bus station - it has no green cover and round the clock jams. \n\nI stay in Bangalore - around 5 kms away from Majestic. My place is full of trees and a lot lesser traffic. The SPM levels in my area are one of the safest in the world. Even though I stay in Bangalore, which is reportedly one of the most polluted cities, I almost never face this pollution. \n\nThe current methodology to measure pollution is ridiculous, simply because spot measurements have no bearing on the pollution levels in a metropolitan area. In a distance as short as 5 kms you will find two different spots having the safest and worst pollution levels. Unless its a smog like that covering Delhi or Shanghai - it doesnt mean that the majority of the areas are affected.\n\n\n"

I reflected on this comment and realised that injustice is not communal in nature, it is idiotic. Labelling it as such goes against the ethos of equality as I understand it as it reinforces divisions within society based on the superfluous elements of a person's human identity.

This propaganda that the Sanghi idiots are trying spread via SM & Whatsapp is BS. The question that needs to be asked is why, though CPI (M) & DYFI are strong across the state, duh, they run the govt, are killings limited to Kannur. Could it be because of the strong presence of RSS there, unlike rest of Kerala? So, could it be that RSS is the original killers and are now playing the classic victim card?\n\nBJP & the Sangh, as we know, are flush with cash, the Adanis & the Ambanis have been generous to their Gujju bhai we know, and can fund any kind of smear & publicitiy campaigns to peddle lies.

"Think about it from the owner's perspective. The cafe owner is running the cafe primarily as a business enterprise, not to appease fellow Indians.

How did a judge grant this serial molester a bail? \n\nWhat was the basis of allowing bail for one who had such influence over the families that they did not report serial sexual abuse of their children?\n\nI think the judge needs to be in jail too. Poor children."
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Most attractive boy was picked after every session of forced group sex: Survivors speak up against Kashmir maulvi** \n\n ______ \nPeer Aijaz Sheikh has indeed left indelible scars on his alleged victims. Speaking to Mail Today, the rape survivors recall chilling tales of abuse, fear and pain inflicted upon by Sheikh, who has been accused of raping minor boys in Kashmir on the pretext of warding off evil by summoning jinns .\n\nThe alleged victims of Sheikh, known as Maulvi Sahab among locals, were so naive that some of them even thought that they would get pregnant and for years lived in the fear of having contracted sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Some of the rape survivors have reportedly developed medical complications after being sodomised.\n\nThe victims alleged that they had no choice but to quietly follow the Peer\'s directions as their families had blind faith in him. Sheikh is currently out on bail and the next hearing of the case in scheduled for September 27.\n\nRAPE SURVIVORS SPEAK UP\n\n"I was 11-year-old when my uncle took me to Aijaz Sheikh. I was sexually abused several times. One night, there were around 10-11 children in the age group of 11 to 14 at his house. He forced us to perform sexual acts from evening until next morning. He used to watch us and would then decide to rape the most attractive boys present there," alleged a victim. Similarly, another victim said Sheikh was a sadist and he was so obsessed with sexual exploitation that he would actually rape kids in front of each other in different positions.\n\n"Once, he sexually abused me to the extent that I fell down on the ground and was badly hurt. I was so innocent that I asked myself what if I get pregnant? What am I going to tell my parents if that happens? For years to come, I feared that I might have also contracted some STDs. Having come out against the accused makes me feel scared for my life." The alleged victims, some of whom are in their teenage now, still can\'t forget the nightmares. One of the teen rape survivors, who claim to have been abused for four years, told Mail Today, "I was forced to drop out from school as I had to oblige the Peer\'s demands. I miss school. Wish I had never gone there. I want to go back to school and finish my studies."\n\nInterestingly, the Peer\'s alleged abuse dates back to the time when he used to teach Quran and Arabic in a school. "I was in Class 4 when I met the Peer. One day he took me to his leisure house in Dangerpora. He would tell his followers to bring a child aged 12 or below, and let the child to spend the night with him. When I was there he told me that I had to sleep in his room, for which I would get money. Soon I found his dark side. He would rape me while pretending to be possessed by jinn. But one day, he mistakenly exposed himself to me and then I realised that I was being abused. I got angry on hearing this and gathered courage to threaten him," said an alleged victim, who was also his student.\n\nSURVIVORS SHOWING SIGNS OF DEPRESSION\n\nMail Today also spoke to the psychologist who is counseling some of the rape survivors in this case. She said these victims have shown symptoms of depression, anxiety, guilt and fear.\n\n"It is not just their physical health, but even their emotional and mental wellbeing have been deeply impacted. The incident has affected their desire to live." While the matter is in the court, the absence of a child protection Act like POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) has devoid the victims of the sensitive approach to deal with such cases. According to child rights\' activist and advocate Anant Asthana, a special law like POCSO is the need of the hour in Jammu and Kashmir to help child victims of sexual offences in availing support from authorities, immediate compensation and a stringent criminal justice system for speedy trial.\n\n"Good thing in POCSO Act is that it not only takes in account the vulnerabilities of victims but also takes cognisance if criminals are the persons who hold authority, influence or dominance over the child in any manner. May be not the entire POCSO Act but a substantial part of it, which strengthens a child victim of sexual offence, must be legislated in J&K. It brings in focus that victims of sexual offences can also be a male child and it is as horrendous as rape of a female child." Asthana said not only a special law but also an independent and strong state commission for protection of child rights in J&K is very essential. "In fact, we need to think of bringing a law better than POCSO because circumstances of children in J&K are much more difficult and complicated. We need to pay more attention on aspects of maintaining absolute privacy of children, more effective measures for protection of victims and witnesses and increased financial allocations for rehabilitation of victims of sexual offences."\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"Anecdotal evidence is not proof of anything.

There's a very high amount of Muslim population in bengal and as a result any kind of communal tension is going to wreak havoc across the state.

Though I\'m definitely not an expert on this, and could be completely wrong.\n\n\n\n> Also, this hindi word is linguistically too cheap word to be used in poems in this way.\n\n\n\nYeah, Nehruji jailed the poet. His government was hypersensitive towards "negative" and "controversial" sentiments. Here is an example from the book - ["Anthems of Resistance: A Celebration of Progressive Urdu Poetry":](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KYbGBgAAQBAJ)\n\n\n\n> This mode of film-making soon ran into problems. The censor board, now under the control of the Indian government, kicked into gear, reflecting the government’s hypersensitivity towards any reference to people’s struggles, particularly in the cause of socialism. Director Ramesh Saigal was asked to delete a line from his movie Kafila/Caravan which went: The caravan of the people of Asia is on the move. Sahir’s line Paise ka raj mita dena (End the rule of the wealthy) was axed from another film. Pradeep’s song from the film Amar Rahe Ye Pyaar/May This Love Be Forever (1961) was deleted in its entirety, presumably because of the lines:\n\n\n> Hai! Siyaasat kitni gandi\n\n\n\n> Buri hai kitni firqa bandi\n\n\n\n> Aaj ye sab ke sab nar-naari\n\n\n> Ho gaye raste ke ye bhikaari\n\n\n\n> (Alas! How dirty are the politics of the time. How despicable this sectarianism. Today, all these men and women. Have been turned into beggars)\n\n\n\n> The lyrics of Phir Subha Hogi were considered so radical that two songs from the film were banned in India. One was:\n\n\n\n> Aasmaañ pe hai khuda aur zameeñ pe hum\n\n\n\n> Aaj kal voh is taraf dekhta hai kam\n\n\n\n> Kis ko bheje voh yahaañ khaak chaan-ne\n\n\n\n> Is tamaam bheed ka haal jaan-ne\n\n\n\n> Aadmi haiñ anginat, devata haiñ kam\n\n\n\n> (God is in the heavens while we are here on earth. These days, He does not pay us much attention. Who can He send here to sift through these sands, To figure out the condition of these teeming masses? For there are too many people, not enough deities)\n\n\n\n> And the other was a parody of the famous Iqbal poem, Saare jahaan se achcha Hindostaañ hamaara (Our India is better than the rest of the world):\n\n\n\n> Cheen-o Arab hamaara, Hindostaañ hamaara\n\n\n\n> Rahne ko ghar nahiñ hai, saara jahaañ hamaara\n\n\n\n\n> (China and Arabia are ours, so is India. Yet we have no home to live in; the whole world is ours)\n\n\n\n> Jitni bhi buildingeñ thiñ, sethoñ ne baant li haiñ\n\n\n\n\n> Footpaath Bambayi ke, haiñ aashiyaañ hamaara\n\n\n\n\n> (The wealthy have distributed all the buildings among themselves.

"I have met the man who identified the mortal remains of the former prime minister - [Dr. Lalji Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalji_Singh) - India's top notch molecular biologist and the father of DNA fingerprinting in India. Back in 2014, I was doing my BSc from BHU and was the vice president of an interdisciplinary discussion group, we had invited him (Dr. Lalji Singh, he was the BHU Vice Chancellor then) for a lecture on the technique he has worked on for years DNA fingerprinting - in his talk he narrated what happened and how he pieced together the remains. He has worked on a number of other high profile cases as well.\n\nHere's an excerpt from his [webpage](http://www.ccmb.res.in/staff/lalji/research.html) at Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology web server,\n\n>Development of a universal probe for DNA fingerprinting\nDr Singh and his colleagues in the CCMB, at Hyderabad, developed a probe called Bkm-derived probe for DNA fingerprinting, as a fall out of their earlier internationally well known work on the mechanisms of determination of sex. Their probe is being extensively used for forensic investigation, paternity determination and seed stock verification. DNA fingerprinting evidence was presented in the court and for the first time in the annals of Indian history this result was accepted as an infallible evidence in the court of law. This verdict was upheld by the Kerala High Court. Since then, they have used this indigenous technique in 500 cases such as paternity disputes, identification of missing children, identification of mutilated bodies, exchange of babies in maternity wards and cases of rape and murder, etc. These include sensational cases of assassination of the late Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi, assassination of Punjab Chief Minister and the famous tandoor case of Naina Sahni.

'Remember that day well. We were glued to television screens as there was fear that it could escalate things further.

He said that in trying to talk about sexual harassment, the girl students "have put their modesty in the market".\n\nWhen Yogi Adityanath was asked whether the girls\' safety inside the campus had been compromised, the chief minister said strict action should have been taken when the matter was first reported, while going on to add that the entry of outsiders in any university must be strictly prohibited.\n\n"The BHU administration should have ensured the safety and security of girls on priority. We have sent a report to the Centre. I assure that the administration will do its utmost to see to it that the aggrieved girls get justice. I have asked the BHU to strictly bar the entry of outsiders or unknown elements inside the premises", Adityanath said.\n\nHOW THE BHU VIOLENCE STARTED\n\nA number of students, including women, and two journalists were injured in a baton-charge by the police in the BHU where a protest on Saturday night against an alleged eve-teasing incident turned violent .

'It would be a huge mistake on their part if they killed him.

"By your logic, there's no reason to believe that the Chinese public like Dalai Lama either since it would be an unverifiable claim.\n\nBut I have to disagree with you here, most of the chinese people who emigrated and settled in other countries were not even aware of the atrocities that had taken place during the tiananmen square protests. Why? Simply because the state-owned media vilified the protestors and painted them as the anti-national elements. And there has been a much more significant and systematic propaganda by the chinese government to vilify the Dalai Lama. And in the absence of any objective source of information people are bound to believe what is fed to them. \n\nI mentioned the student protests in UC San Diego because these are students living in a democratic country and have access to objective sources of information and yet they chose to protest against him. Sure, you could argue that there might have been repercussions for their parents/family members back in China had they vocally supported him, especially for the businessmen and bureaucrats, but there wasn't any good reason to actively protest unless they genuinely believed in him being 'oppressive' which is probably the result of the propaganda."

And the whole debacle in 1962 was [almost entirely India's fault](http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2923/stories/20121130292300400.htm). I doubt even you knew it before this point.

We need to remove the stupid, ridiculous parts from our religion, before they take down the wonderful parts too.\n\nAny ideas if this is even possible?

Another is to provide free or low-cost Internet access to the poor, so that they can learn more about the world, and are exposed to alternate points of view.

'404 is not necessarily a mainstream CS topic. There are many things CS engineering offers and 404 is just a very very small percentage of it. 404 is an error code dedicated to resource unavailability in the web world (internet). So, it\'s pathetic if a web programmer does not know what a 404 is. But, it\'s not surprising of a person who did engineering without having interest in computer engineering related stuff at all to not know 404. I saw that episode and she did not seem like a person who was keen on technical learning and she also said it herself. She somehow did btech to get a degree and a job, probably with low passing marks. The very fact that she did not get a technical job even after doing mtech proves that she does not know her stuff well. She later went into some clerical govt job which is not at all related to CS.\n\nAlso, if someone, even a non-CS person, does a lot of internet browsing it\'s possible they might have seen a 404 page not found sometime. But not sure how many people read error code on the page. And most websites have customized 404 pages which are nicer and do not show the number 404 anyway and instead show a user friendly message.\n\nWhat\'s wrong with gaav ka aadmi knowing answers to difficult questions?

Moreover the demonetization of the banknotes did nothing. The rich were hardly affected and the burden was borne by the lower and middle class people. Lynching of people in the name of national integrity cannot be accepted. They put ban on the internal consumption of beef products only to benefit from it\'s export. There are so many things that we need to see, research and gauge out ourselves but that cannot happen while we blindly accept what the government asks us to do. Why are we paying taxes on transacting from our own account? Granted that using ATMs other than our own banks should incur charges but it\'s simply extortion by the government that I have to pay them even when I\'m taking out MY OWN MONEY.

All the while claiming in their final piece of legislation(Communal Violence Bill, 2013) that they wanted to push that only Hindus are culpable of communal violence.

That was my immediate thought. But after some time, when I came to know that govt will be introducing Rs. 2000 note, "Chutia" just blurted out of mouth. \n\nAll he did was a change of notes, from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2000, fucker could have have allowed that simple in a span of 1 year or so instead of banning the existing notes in 4 hours.

"Wrong analysis. Despite Nitish Kumar being named the CM candidate, it was Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD that got more votes and seats. That clearly shows Nitish Kumar's falling reputation in Bihar.\n\nAnd within his party, many are already unhappy with Nitish Kumar for jumping party-to-party according to his whims (read: [Bihar political crisis: After resignation, Nitish Kumar's biggest challenge is to keep JD(U) united](http://www.firstpost.com/politics/bihar-political-crisis-after-resignation-nitish-kumars-biggest-challenge-is-to-keep-jdu-united-3859665.html)). Many of his own party members have highlighted how this presents them a big problem in their contituency - as one day they are asking for vote in the name of secularism (when they are allied with the RJD / Congress) and the next day they have to defend the BJP when they are with them. Naturally, the voters lose confidence and that is why the JD(U) base has been shrinking."
">He didn't see this coming or thought Nitish was bluffing on breaking alliance. \n\nThis is entirely wrong, Lalu in a interview in the afternoon clearly said Nitish new what was coming and joined the alliance, he can't handle it he should resign, and in the evening Nitish resigned.  \n\nEdit,: Spelling.\n   "

"I'm not accusing you OP but I really don't understand some things. When people talk about law and order problems and jungle raj, why don't they ever mention the MASSIVE rape of law and order by BJP in the entire fucking country during the Ram Janmabhoomi conflict?? Or why isn't Gujarat in 2002 under Modi considered jungle raj?? People related to Vyapam scam are drying unnatural deaths every other month. Why no crusade against corruption in MP?

"Totally agree. I think early on, they tried to play it safe because it's a 'touchy' issue of a woman slapping a man. The laws are completely biased against a man if a woman even just accuses him of assaulting her. Then they were hit with the police complaint against them by the guy who shot the video. It was probably then that it evolved from just a PR disaster to a full blown legal+PR disaster.

The airline staff would be suspended, arrested, beaten by police and jailed for few years.  \nAnd for that girl, there would be candle marches, all major newspapers would carry the news on how women are being molested and harassed. The guy would end up in jail, get beaten, have his carrier ruined, shamed by the entire country and feminazis would be having an intense orgasms.  \nSo assault and battery are not taken lightly in this country, it's depends on who the attacker is. \nIts sad to see that you and I as law abiding citizens can literally do nothing if we are against someone privileged or powerful.

'Rahul Pandita, the Kashmiri journalist has tweeted that such attack was bound to happen as Jihadis are hoping a reaction elsewhere. There has been several attacks before it too however they were passed off as cylinder blasts to avoid communal flares. '
"they don't care who they're killing. shooting themselves on foot.  Only if they realize that there will be a massive crackdown after this"
"These people targeted a school and killed a bunch in Pakistan a few years back. Whatever we have to say about them, there's nothing stopping them. You cannot win against a guy who's ready to put down his life for some godforsaken cause, which he truly believes in. What are you going to do, kill him? I'm afraid there really is no short term solution for Islamic terrorism. We truly live at the behest of these monsters. "
"These terrorists anyways don't care about Muslims.\n\nTheir fight is against India, not against Hindus. They'll even screw over Muslims if they're Indians."
'More kashmiri Muslims are killed by terrorists than the police and army combined.'
"They don't have to. They have delegated their surrogates who will appear across all TV news networks and claim the terrorist attack was conducted by someone who's a economically troubled youth for Independent Kashmir.\n\nRinse, repeat. "

Because they got butt hurt when people protested against their dear leader and now they have to use every opportunity to attack the award wapsi gang. \n\nIn case you didn\'t understand, let me explain it to you. Award wapsi was done in order to protest against the government which gave the awards. Because the BJP government was supporting gau rakshaks etc. \n\nIn this case, do you mean the current kashmir BJP government is supporting these terrorists?  \n\nAlso, notinmyname rallies were taken out because the government and a lot of people who elected them supported the lynchings. It was becoming normal. Modis ministers had called for death penalty for eating beef. Their union minister had visited one of the lynchers in akhlaq case and draped national flag over it. \n\nIn this case do you see Muslims all over India supporting it and calling for more terror attacks against amaranth pilgrims like a lot of sanghis and BJP ministers do in case of beef lynchings? \n\nMuslims did protest against terrorism some time back. \n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/70000-indian-muslim-clerics-issue-fatwa-against-isis-the-taliban-al-qaida-and-other-terror-groups-a6768191.html\n\n>Nearly 15 lakh (1.5m) Muslims have recorded their protest.

"I don't get why it's so easy for people to forget that the main reason for AFSPA and other restrictive shit in Kashmir, is that the residents of the state were simply unable to control terrorism and maintain the peace! Want AFSPA out? Drive out every last militant and terrorist hiding among you, in your houses and communities, turn them over to the police, and have your entire local police force held accountable if they don't secure them appropriately. I'd any day prefer that every last one of those militants gets tried and jailed, rather than killed. But when civilians are complicit in shielding them, you're not leaving the armed forces much of a choice. "
"The attack was carried out by LeT (apparently), LeT was always a terror outfit. Wani and co belonged to the HuM, they are an insurgency group that as a policy don't target civilians. \n"

'1. Install bins.\n2. Appoint people to fine those who are littering. There is no other way. This will also collect hell lot of money in the first few months. But when it hurts financially, they will stop doing it.'
"Its because there are no proper dust bins. Coming from Goa, where most places, there's like a government public dustbin every 200-400 meters or something (atleast in residential areas), here's its just ridiculous.\n\nAt my current residence here in marathahalli, I have no clue where there is a dustbin nearby that will be picked up regularly.  \nAll I know is that, in about 3-4 days, one guy comes on a tractor that picks up trash (early in the day, mostly I don't get up). Compare that to the government employees from the garbage department in Goa, giving everyone separate dustbins, and then coming to pick it up nearly every single day (in addition to having the public dustbins). Its a really bad feeling."
"I wonder if a firm (cruel) leadership is the solution to these basic problems? \n\nI'd tighten the laws, severely punish the lazy law enforcers, and make curriculum changes if I had PM's authority. (Something like the gulf countries, but a bit more humane?) "
"wow!! that's nasty! "
'One would assume that the sand is still nasty and polluted. Am I correct in this.'

"That's even more wrong. The central government introduced new laws last year. The fines are much higher now"
'Notice the use of the word "biggest"? Ceterus paribus better law enforcement investigations would lead to faster disposal of cases and swift judgment. A lot of those pending cases are not the disease but a symptom of erroneous and incompetent investigations.'

"> The maligning of Gandhi is sadly rather popular in this country. \n\nTrue. I said this earlier. Once he is maligned, his killers can be rehabilitated by the Sangh. \n\nI am also against the constant belittling of his contribution to the freedom struggle.  I find it funny when people claim that UK would have given up India after the war anyway, because the war had weakened them. For such people, here is a list of countries that gained independence from Britain. Sort on year, and see how many countries continued as colonies till 50s and 60s. They gave up India because of the resistance. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom\n\nWhat exactly was his contribution? I don't know what is being taught in schools and colleges, but before Mahatma Gandhi arrived on the scene, the freedom movement was only of the educated elite, and not a mass movement. He turned it into a movement of the people. If he had no contribution, why did Nehru and Patel defer to him and his wishes? Why did they make him the undisputed leader? Why did the British talk to him and not to other leaders? People try to equate Netaji Subhash Bose to him, but in 1945, Bose was already gone, so where was the need for the British to be scared of Bose? Unfortunately, it is easier to believe the Sangh narrative rather than to ask such questions. "

They thought different colored people were not meant to be in level with them.Dogs and Indians are not allowed.In India!? Tell me if your blood won\'t boil today, if you see the same signboard in some Pizzeria outlet of NYC.The way you cry racism for everything.\n\nThat was when Gandhi decided "Enough of this bullshit."He taught us Indians what is wrong and what are your rights first.You see,we plebeians were stuck in the middle of Maharajahs orders and British colonials.Between the Rock and a hard place.\n\n'

"I don't understand why can they not teach how Gandhi evolved from a normal person to extra ordinary.\nFirst he is portrayed as 'Mahatma' and then students get exposed to his shortcomings. It makes difficult for people. \nPeople must know what and how of being a 'Mahatma'. \n\n"
"This.\n\nI have never met anyone who didn't have a polarized view of Gandhi. He is either a saint or a partitioning devil. Kids are taught that he was non-violent and his murderers were wrong, without explaining the ideology behind the conspiracy.\n\nHe was just a human with human flaws, and so was Godse. Everyone needs to taught both points of view so they can come to their own judgement, instead of brainwashing 6 year olds who will later think its cool to hate on Gandhi."

I hate to see an animals life used as a pawn of tribalistic politics. \n  \nThe ethics of eating meat **concerning the animal itself** is completely lost in this discussion.  \n  \nI mean if we were talking about BJP bans on eating wheat or lentil or something innocent, yes this would totally be a political issue about our rights to eat things. But cattle aren't a commodity. It's a fucking animal that can think, feel, and suffer.  \n \nI guess no one even gives a shit about that huh? Country full of vegetarians and no one has even thought *why* that is."
"I'm against the beef ban in India, because I'm respectful of the traditions of the people who may eat it (Nagas, for example) but I'm equally against people mocking or chastising Hindus for refusing to eat beef. Do not conflate the two. The latter is never acceptable. Being against a beef ban is understandable, mocking Hindus for it makes you agenda-driven and anti-Indian.\n\nAs a meat-eating Hindu, I love bacon. Cue the outrage if I were to tell Muslims to enjoy some nice ham. "

All of us enjoy our beef fry and tapioca when in Kerala. Nobody to get offended there. Here, just saying, "I\'ve tasted beef," gets people to low-key offense mode. '
"Iam an atheist vegetarian aswell and I have no problem with people eating meat. No matter what you do you will end up hurting one animal or the other in your day to day life. Human beings did not evolve as vegetarians so it's stupid to say it's the best lifestyle. Bottomline is don't dictate Wat people put in their mouths. Wat if someone Tommorow starts a religion claming plants as their gods, would you agree with a nation wide plant eating ban? "
"No one is mocking? It's Non beef eating Hindus forcing their eating habits on the rest of us. I am a vegetarian Hindu and I am strongly against the beef ban. "

"Anti-Indian my ass. I'd die for my country while eating beef."
"Nobody is mocking anyone. I'm Muslim and I've been told several times tot try bacon or pork. My friends frequently order dishes for themselves when we go out to eat together, and I don't bat an eyelid. I just tell them politely I'd much rather not, and nobody drops dead. \n\nHell, I don't even like beef all that much, but when the Govt decides to direct what people can eat or not, even as people are getting lynched and killed for the same, it's just revolting. What about the thousands of cattle traders/butchers, etc. Where do they expect a lot of people from lower socioeconomic statuses to get their required protein from? Unnecessary and intrusive. "

'How drunk were you when you established a connection between the thread and your comment?'
"Yeah I know, I'm from the MH-Guj mallu community as well. My family in particular can barely even be called mallu, we can just about speak the language and most of us haven't tasted beef, half aren't even non-veg. None of that will matter though if shit does hit the fan. The people who died in 2002 weren't the ones that set the train on fire either. Guilt by association and all that, having a last name like Nair, Kutty, etc., will be enough. "
"It's not surprising really that a country would blindly follow its traditions without really thinking about where those traditions come from. Every country does this, that is in fact what most people around the world do. They just do things because that's what they've always done. \n  \n \n----- \n  \nI'm not going to pretend to be a Hindu scholar but I will go out on a limb and suggest the basis for vegetarianism in Hinduism is out of a welfare concern for the animals.  \n  \nThat would actually be a good question for /r/AskHistorians and I wouldn't mind being proved wrong about that. \n  \nRegardless of how it started, I am sure that most Hindus today don't eat beef just because.. that's what they've been told. That 'cows are sacred or something'. \n  \nMy point is, a country with more vegetarians than most, is oddly inconsiderate about the welfare of animals. That is pretty ironic.  \nMeanwhile, Israel (with no traditional tendency towards vegetarianism beyond pork) has the largest per-capita vegan population. It seems like there are two types of vegetarians: those who are born into the tradition and don't know why they are.. and those who come to understand the moral implications of eating meat.   \n  \nHence it is ironic that a country with a much higher percentage of vegetarians would be so unconcerned about the welfare of animals.

"Why do those people need to be asked to be considerate of others? Why doesn't it come from within? Is the only reason they aren't pissing down my throat because of social compulsion?

"This this is what I don't get about fellow desis, it just doesn't come from within, not sure why."

'But if the gunshot leads to death, was it non-fatal?'

Their emphasis on tolerance, peace and equality made them living deities for some.

They were revolutionaries and both of them worked for liberation.\n\n**The biggest point was that Buddha and Mahavira were not banned.** They were allowed to present their views without any known violence from those they opposed. Even those that did not agree with them, allowed them to speak freely, and often found their lot as the right thing.\n\nThis time, you won't get Buddhas or Mahaviras.

"What's the solution though? It's a conundrum. It's the protestors' right under FOE to protest on Social Media, and the businesses' right to sate them to avoid bad publicity. It's also the comedian's right under FOE to mock the Prime Minister. Similar issues are happening in the US with vehemently pro-Trump or anti-Trump businesses too."
"Different issue though. Social Media campaigns against brands due to their political stance can't just be shown the door, as they have a tendency to magnify and spread falsehoods. This can lead to a significant loss of revenue and traction. This is not just theoretical, but the business faces tangible losses which they can't just ignore. So, they end up being very cautious and politically risk-averse. Taking a stance publicly is just not worth it for the brand or senior management."

After that, all the ad runs or bill boards are not remunerated separately. So, if Pepsi did an ad shoot for 2 days and did an event promotion for half a day and a mall visit for another half day, he would get a total of 15 crores and all the creatives generated can be used for a stipulated period of time (usually a year or 2 or 3).'

"It's the same what previous LG did. It's our fucked up oldest Law that has given rights to the the Centre. Centre wants full control of the country.

It exposed how crowd is bought from other states like cattle to attend the rallies. "
'They do this so that during the next Delhi Elections they can portray all the decisions blocked by the L-G as the "unfulfilled" promises of the AAP government. Even the BJP had fullstatehood for Delhi in their portfolio yet neither do they do anything about it nor let anyone else do something.\n\nAnd then the people are fucked up. I can still not comprehend why one would fucking vote for the BJP in the MCD Elections. The only thing BJP and Bhakts find wrong in AAP is Kejriwal\'s jacket, Kejriwal\'s muffler, Kejriwal\'s sandals. They don\'t talk about their policies because they know that AAP is doing some serious work and people fall for this fucking tactic.\n\nI have heard many people say things like "Humne bhi Kejriwal par bharosa kia tha, dekho kitna ghatiya aadmi nikla" and "Behenchod kehta hai mujhe pradhanmantri banna hai". They have deep-rooted hatred for him and it\'s all because they think he keeps making excuses. They don\'t give a flying fuck about the reality of the matter and it really disgusts me.\n\nHowever, I have observed an anti-BJP phenomenon on social media these days and it has helped in generating more pro-AAP sentiment. Let\'s hope for the best.\n\nEdit: Just watched Kejriwal\'s speech in Delhi Assembly. He fucking nailed it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHZAmoLnl3E'
"I've actually changed my house once, and am seriously thinking of moving out of Delhi because of fucking street dogs\n\nThe MCD is just not doing its job of keeping street dog populations in check. Last winter, I had to sleep with earphones on and white noise playing because the dogs would keep barking all through the night.\n\nWhy? Because there are too many dogs and too little space for them. The MCD is supposed to neuter dogs but that just isnt happening\n\nI moved to a new locality and its the same thing. There are 3-4 groups of dogs all fighting for the same turf. Each mating season their population swells even more. I was up all through last night because of barking dogs\n\nFucking hell man. Just had to rant"
'Because BJP takes Delhites for a bunch of stupid people who don\'t know which work comes under whose purview so they keep stalling and terminating Delhi gov\'s projects through LG in the hope that people think Kejriwal is the one incompetent! and when he speaks about LGs dictatorship, they brand him as "whiny,dharna,drama party".  \n\nThat\'s how Modi creates a narrative against AAP. Modi is dangerously obsessed with taking revenge against Kejriwal as he was ruthlessly beaten in Delhi especially when Modi wave was sweeping the entire country ! I believe Delhites have shown him the mirror before and they\'ll do it again. Sooner or later, the cancer that is,Modi will die down.\n\nedit: Full statehood to Delhi is the only way out.'

'Delhi is being punished for rejecting the 56 inch chest and giving the Lotus 3/70. \nThe sheeple then voted in the BJP in the municipal elections.\nFat chance, we have collapsing landfills overflowing sewers and broken roads. Except in the NDMC zone, obviously.'
"Let me try to be a devil's advocate (I swear I am not a bhakth and hardly care abt Delhi politics or BJP).\nPlease read it with a neutral mind and dont bring your AAP support mindset and kill me. \n\nAAP did some funny mistakes, it always blamed Congress for being inactive on items which were typically under LG. \nAnd went ahead and promised people of items in its manifesto things which they should have in first place that is not under the State govts gambit. \nIt was an issue of precommit but not checking facts that they made promises.\nThis could have been three reason for this:\n- First AAP could have thought they will anyway gain control of these things after winning elections \nor - Second they would have deliberately tried to blame BJP saying it is not allowing by choosing items which were typically under LG\nor - Third, they did very poor study to commit for something that they should have known in first place doesnt come under State govt..\nGood example is blaming Shiela dixit for crime rate when they knew that Police is a Central govt subject. It realized this once they won election and simply used this a tact of putting blame on BJP. \n\nSecond point:\nGo for any country the capital only have a dummy govt and police and many points of that is under Central govt. \nEven in US it is like this. Washington DC state has very little power on how the state is run. \nThere is a reason for this, else it will enable a CM (of just 20 million population city state) to arrest PM of a 1 Billion country by putting wrong blame on him. Same thing with administrative office etc. \nA PM or Railway minister should not be waiting for a CM of 20mln city state to allot him bungalow.  \nThis is the reason there are few items of Capital region which will only come under Central subject. \n\nJust bragging 24 hours saying I am democratically elected will do no good to everyone. These are things someone who is running for CM should have studied before becoming a CM and know his limit. \nHe should not not cried fowl when he was squarely blaming the previous CM. \n\nJust my two cents"
"You should have seen the coverage of the alleged scandal where one of the AAP minister's sex tape got leaked. AAP immediately fired the minister although I think (correct me if I'm wrong) it was an act of consensual sex. Times Now, Zee News, Aaj Tak and all other govt's 'lap dog' channels were building a narrative of power getting into AK's and AAP's head and of his AAP partymen losing faith in AK. I mean some of these channels have become a laughing stock. But they command viewers who don't really scrutinise the news.\nPoliticians in the BJP, Congress and other parties have been caught red handed and charged in all and sundry cases, yet firing a minister for misconduct is extremely rare in these big national parties. When an AAP minister was caught faking a degree he was also immediately fired. Smriti Irani's degree are a subject of great controversy. But she has recieved promotions after promotion. Our own PM's degree was also called into question but the media does not talk about it. It's a sad situation"
'AAP has (had?) a real chance of becoming a national level contender to BJP/Congress.\n\nPeople mock them for contesting and losing elections all around the country - but they need this. They need to keep portraying that they are driven by an ideology anyone in the country can get behind, rather than shaky alliances built on language or regional identity. If BJP slips up (PR-wise, economy-wise, or corruption-wise) he needs to be there to occupy the lost ground.\n\nThe biggest issue with AAP is to break out of Delhi and get a real state in hand. They came close with Punjab, but unfortunately they peaked at the wrong time and had (legitimate?) criticism to face by the time elections drew near. Having a state will provide them constitutionally clear sovereignty and autonomy to work freely.\n\nA lot of things Kejriwal used to say (and I personally dismissed as him whining) have come out to be true. One particular example would be him accusing the discoms of unfair electricity pricing and claims that prices will fall to half if an audit was done. Recently, there was a report that Adani has inflated the price of construction of power plants by routing the equipment through shell corporations and inflating prices by 400% by doing so, and we pay for this corruption at ₹1-₹2 on every unit. (By us I mean the consumers served by those particular power plants).\n\nThis EVM thing again sounds like a guy off his rockers, but he does have a track record. But even if half his claims are true, he is attacking interests which are deeply entrenched and intertwined with the political class. Reports by that Australian news agency on how they were harassed by the police when they tried shooting their video report just add credence to this claim.'
"The real culprit is not LG, it's fascist Modi. LG is just a chamcha appointed to carry out Modi's political agenda.\n\nWhen I look at the situation in Delhi, I immediately get irritated by people who criticize AK and ask him to be silent and do his work. He is attacking Modi BECAUSE he is not allowed to work. Why is that so difficult to understand?"
'AAP has not been able to fulfill its promises. All the initiatives in their manifestos remain unfilled or significantly behind schedule. \n\n1) DTC still in shambles. No new buses bought when there is a significant shortage of buses.\n\n2) Odd-Even Scheme was a total flop. So much time and money wasted on it.    \n\n3) Mohalla clinics targets are far from being met. Proper land also not provided. Most of these clinics are constructed on footpaths!\n\n4) Sheer wastage of hundreds of crores in advertisements for self promotion.\n\n5) CCTVs not installed. They had promised 10-15 lakhs.\n\nAAP is back to its old habits of blaming others for their own failures. LG is just an easy target for them. \n  '

So LG has more power than other state governors.'
"So that centre can control states. See the fuck-up being done by governors countrywide, Kiran Bedi has sworn in three BJP people as MLAs, and barred press from covering the event. In Tamil Nadu, governor was camping in Mumbai to make sure that MLA cattle trading got finished and then didn't hold a floor test. Governors are supposed to be like generators in case the mains fail, but in India they are over-riding the democratically elected governments. Congress was this pathetic too, and paved way for BJP to do this damage. "

"I am just putting my thoughts here. Just to further this discussion.  \n\nYour argument is accurate. 1 molecule of Methane is equivalent to 26 molecules of CO2 in GHG potential. But that scientific argument also needs to be weighed against the reality of our country.   \n\nIndia has more cattle than China, US and EU put together (Telling from the top of my mind. Read it somewhere.). We are rearing them for several purposes which probably does not include meat in my opinion. Also India has a huge nutritional requirement for its population. Lives of milch and draft animals were not as prolonged where a 'fit-for-slaughter' certificate was issued once they needed to be discarded. Prolonged life means higher contribution to GHG. Methane is further added to atmosphere by rotting carcasses when these animals are not buried or cremated. (I am only talking about cattle reared for milk and draught once their utility is finished. This argument obviously completely IGNORES how humane we should be to other species, also to each other. Maybe cattle can be fed to captive or wild carnivores which may have its own environmental concerns. )\n\nFor obvious reasons, making the population dependent on meat for their protein requirements is not the right way to go ahead. It is a terrible burden on the environment. But is that burden reduced or increased by Indian population consuming cattle meat? I am not so sure of that.  In an ideal word,  we should not be dependent on animals at all. \n\n  \nI am just blabbering but may be I added some value to the discussion.\n\nedit:- Some words may seem callous here. I am just of the opinion that using soft words for harsh human actions are not justified."

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Marijuana should be legalised for medical purposes, says Maneka Gandhi** \n\n ______ \nWomen and child development minister Maneka Gandhi. File photo: Hindustan Times\n\nNew Delhi: Women and child development minister Maneka Gandhi has suggested legalising marijuana, a psychoactive drug, in India for medical purposes on the lines of the practice adopted by some developed countries like the US to curb drug abuse.\n\nThe suggestion was made by Gandhi at a meeting of a group of ministers (GoM), which examined the draft cabinet note National Drug Demand Reduction Policy, according to the minutes of the second meeting, a copy of which is with PTI.\n\nThe GoM approved the draft national policy with minor modifications suggested in the meeting. Gandhi informed that in “some of the developed countries like the US, marijuana has been legalised which ultimately results in less drug abuse”.\n\nShe said that “the possibility of the same maybe explored in India”, as per the document.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Gandhi told PTI that “marijuana should be legalised for medical purposes, especially as it serves a purpose in cancer”.\n\nDuring the meeting of the GoM, which was chaired by home minister Rajnath Singh, Gandhi also stressed on the need for regulating the sale and availability of pharmaceutical drugs such as codeine cough syrups and inhalants among others which are being abused. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has directed the GoM to examine the draft policy for drug demand reduction which seeks to address the problem of drug and substance abuse in the country.\n\nReferring to the national survey on drug abuse, conducted by the ministry of social justice in collaboration with AIIMS, which covers students, transgenders and sex workers among others, Gandhi said children especially those living in and around major railway stations should also be covered. She also suggested exploring the possibility of setting up de-addiction centres near these railway stations.\n\nOn the issue of legalising drugs in the country, the social justice and empowerment secretary G. Latha Krishna Rao said “it may not be appropriate to legalise such drugs” in view of the large population and low level of literacy in the country and added that the possibility could be explored in future.\n\nAs per the document, minister for chemicals and fertilisers Ananth Kumar observed that drugs were easily available outside schools and colleges and said that an action plan needs to be drawn to create awareness and sensitise students against drug abuse in schools, colleges and universities.\n\nSingh, who is also the minister of parliamentary affairs, said that the role of home ministry should also be well defined in the proposed policy. The GoM also recommended the projected budget estimate of Rs125 crore annually for implementation of the policy.\n\nIn an earlier meeting, the GoM had proposed preparing an action plan for controlling over the counter sale of sedatives, pain killers, muscle relaxants among others and preparing treatment modules for different age groups, including the subject of treatment of drug addicts as part of MBBS curriculum. It also sought setting up of de-addiction centres in all prisons, juvenile homes, factories and industries.

If someone draped an actual flag on the doormat then there would be fights among neighbors. But the image of our flag on a doormat is still just a doormat.

"Amazon employee here.\n\nThe issue of Indian Flag doormat was already being discussed internally and was escalated atleast a day before the tweet by Sushma Swaraj. This had happened 1-2 times in the past and was dealt with very soon. Its impossible for Amazon to be aware of these kind of products before anyone reports them, since the seller might say he is selling doormat's and upload and indian flag doormat. That is why these systems are in place.\n\nI as an Indian too was offended by these products. Nationality is not something to be ashamed of. However Shushma Swaraj should have tried to bring this to Amazon's attention instead of tweeting out a threat. This is not the way anyone should abuse their powers.\n\nHowever, comparing this to the content censoring in prime video is not right. When the government has already clarified that they do not want to censor content online, Amazon does not need to do that on its own. I am unsure what kind of standards are being followed here: sex scenes are completely fine as long as nipples are censored?? What the Actual FUCK is this? If you are actually following the indian standards, why even show ass or entire sex scenes at all? Looks like the decision was made by someone who is a huge fan of ass but not boobs.\n\nGet your shit together Amazon!!!"

Though the item is being sold outside the country, Indian officials can always request/ put pressure on amazon to take them off .

"Looked around a bit, the link seems removed in Amazon Canada. Searched the seller and he only sells Indian flag doormats, I presume its popular given the demographics of canada lol. And our own nationalists have abused random companies selling other doormats because they couldn't find the removed link. They are asking to take down UK flag doormats now.\n\nAdditionally it seems the guy who showed it to Sushma Swaraj is now being threatened by liberals because his name appears on all news articles now. This seems a clusterfuck of retarded people from all walks of life. "

If other countries want their flag getting insulted on doormat,  then let it be,  but that doesn't mean we should tolerate such gross insult of our national flag.    \n \nAnd whether Amazon is producing or not is irrelevant here.  It is their responsibility to look after stuffs which are put up on their website.  Let's say a seller starts selling meth or some other drug on Amazon,  will you still argue the same?      \n \nAnd your point about investment is absurd.  These foreign companies don't come here to do charity.  If they can earn good money in India,  they won't stop coming,  even if they have to do ass licking of anyone. "
"I don't know what content on amazon prime has to do with selling door mats with the national flag or how that is a justifiable reason for censoring content. But as far as having a flag doormat goes, I'm with swaraj on that one. It's utterly stupid and insulting. Being called a doormat is an insult in itself and to have the national flag on that is ridiculous. I mean I'm not patriotic in the least but even I would cringe if I see flag doormats. not to mention that it's shitty commercialism. She is a politician and they are supposed to do things to set things like this right. Swaraj is holding Amazon accountable because they are the only ones who can do anything about it. And personally I don't care if Americans are ok with having their flags on doormats, I wouldn't want to clean my feet on their flag either. "

With the upcoming presedential elections where Advani is posturing for a role but which Modi is denying Advani his due, Swaraj is placating ultra nationalists with this shenanigans. Now Modi cannot openly or quitely tell Swaraj to shut up about this non issue and affect the investment climate in a volatile economy after demonitization. His only next step would be to offer some incentive to Gadkari or Swaraj of the Advani camp. But I agree, MNCs do have to put up with terrible shit like this everywhere."
'> The message this sends to investors is crystal-clear: the government is erratic and irrational.\n\nOr this might actually be a more sinister calculated move. Remember, one of Right-Wing\'s larger goals is to isolate India from the external world and create a Juche-like state with no "Western Influences". We have Flipkart and Ola cozying up to government to get rid of Amazon and Uber respectively. Wallmart will also not be allowed as it will threaten domestic Reliance.\n\nBasically, Right-Wing is lobbied by an elite circle of Indian businessmen who see India\'s recent global opening-up as a threat. The more India becomes integrated and visible globally, the more our domestic elite feel threatened. So, this might just be a larger part of manufacturing an image that global companies like Amazon are Anti-National and thus cannot be trusted.\n\nIn fact, this might set off a chain of events where people will now search other companies selling "Anti-National" products and bring it to her attention, to get their share of 15 minutes of fame, and this will snowball into a giant Pseudo-Patriotism fest, thereby creating public opinion towards nationalism and pro-domestic-business-elites.'

I've also had some days where I had to visit the police station for over a week just to get permissions to shoot a short film, and days where it took hardly 20 minutes. So it always depends on what kind of personal experience you've had with the police - and sadly negative emotions register easily."
"If that were the case, then the mafia would have no fear and they would openly operate (like in the 1990s), but I don't see that happening in Mumbai anymore. That leaves only one logical explanation: either the mafia have been wiped out of Mumbai, or they fear the Mumbai Police."

The Jeeyar brought the van to the Palani taluk police station and lodged a complaint stating that the cattle was transported in a van without following guidelines and that they were dumped in the van without any feed and water. Preliminary inquiries suggested that Udayakumar of Thevanur Pudhur near Pollachi was transporting the cattle.\n\n>As the police took a long time to decide on filing a case against the cattle owner, the information about seizure of cattle spread in the town.\n\n>Members of various Muslim organisations assembled before the police station condemning the seizure of cattle.\n\n>At the same time, members of a few Hindu outfits too came to the taluk police station. When the Jeeyar came out of the police station, an unruly mob threw stones on his vehicle and people waiting outside the station. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob. Later, members of Hindu outfit picketed the road. Four injured persons were admitted to Palani Government Hospital for treatment.\n'

"> It's not as if the police resorted to force willy nilly.\n\nNo, but watching the segment in the video it is clear that the police violence lasted longer than it needed to, and in their zeal for beating up a few, they allowed a much larger number to flee. The police do need better training, and the violent mobs deserve to tot in jail after conviction, not an eye for an eye treatment from cops."

"> culture of the state.\n\nTrue. Both Kerala and Tamil Nadu rejected conservative hindu movements since the late 19th century because of the **severity of the caste system** in both the states. The very low percentage of UC hindus in the states (*Kerala hinduism is 70% OBC+Dalit while in TN its almost 85-90%*) also contributed to the lack of support for Hindu revivalist movements which were after all pioneered by Brahmin thinkers. \n\nWhile in TN, the movement took the form of Dravidanism under periyar which rejected Brahmin power and put Tamil-dravidian identity at the forefront, Kerala's social awakening was divided into reformist hindu movements under OBC/Dalit leaders like Narayana guru and Ayyankali and the communist movement . The BJP is enjoying a revival in Kerala since late 2000's due to the neglect of Hindu interests for minority votebank politics.  "

"**‘We often sleep empty stomach’: BSF jawan’s video exposes the mess caused by corruption**\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/army-thumb.jpg?w=480)\n\n___\n\nArmy jawan alleges corruption by officers. Army jawan alleges corruption by officers.\n\nAt a time when those complaining about standing in bank queues due to demonetisation are being asked by the ‘so called nationalists’ to compare their pain to that of the soldiers standing at border, a BSF jawan has shared three videos which describe how our national heroes are badly treated, while doing their duty, by none other than the administration. The videos expose the dismal state of affairs in the Armed forces and the hardships our soldiers face everyday due to the “corrupt practices” of their own officers. And there is nothing nationalist about it. In fact, the videos, that have gone viral, may deter young aspirants from joining the armed force.\n\nThe video suggests that our jawans are not just exposed to the security threat from across the border and the elements, but are also subjected to humiliation and insult when it comes to their daily meals which are both substandard and insufficient. In fact, they even sleep empty stomach at times, the video reveals.\n\nArmy or paramilitary jawans usually don’t speak against seniors fearing strict punishment. However, Jawan Tej Bahadur of 29 battalion showed courage, may be because of his desperation, to talk about that humiliation without caring about the consequences. While we are told that Army provides best of food items to its jawans, the video of Bahadur presents a different picture. Half-baked chapatis and inedible daal are what the jawans get in their lunch, as shown in the video.\n\n“It must be looking very beautiful in the picture. But I want to tell you that our condition here is very pathetic. In these difficult conditions, we are honestly doing our duty. But what we are not getting sufficient food to eat. How can we do our duty then?” Bahadur questions in the video. One can imagine what must be going through the minds of jawans while being served such a distasteful meal.\n\nRead Also: BSF jawan in LoC alleges bad quality food; inquiry ordered\n\nInterestingly, Bahadur says that he doesn’t blame the government for all this. “Mai sarkar ko dosh nahi deta. Sarkar humey sab kuch deti hai. Ye adhikari hain jo sab kuch bahar bech detey hain. Iski jaanch honi chahiye,” says the jawan, blaming the officers and not the government, adding that his voice be heard by the media. Well, thanks to the power of the internet, his appeal has been widely circulated wihtin a few hours.\n\nFrom Bofors to Tatra truck, the list of corruption in the Army is not short. And if what Tej Bahadur is alleging is true, then it seems even the basic necessities are subject to graft in the forces. It is sad to note that while we have money to spend on new arms and equipment, there is no mechanism to ensure that our men on the border, our first line of defence, at least get a good meal at the end of the day for their efforts.

"He will be fired for sure, and may be ostracized by his peers and community. I will be surprised if the risk he's taken does not go in vain."
"Haven't seen the video. But curious as I used to believe that armed forces unit cook their own food. So if he is getting half baked chapatis and inedible dal, it could be a bad cook"
"They probably take out their frustrations on the local populace. That's why the kashmiris are up in arms!"
'We are all into this and contributing to it.The logic people give - " The farmers/veg & fruit sellers who mix chemicals in food should be hanged, its the utmost crime". But last month when I told him  to burn his stash of 500/1000 or donate it to some needy atleast, he just couldnt let it go. Huh !!!!

'So you want to ban that as well?'
"You are right, that is a possibility. However if you notice, in the first video, he reiterates that there is no issue at the Govt's side, and that only his senior officers are to be blamed. But he's famous now, could definitely get a ticket from party, and thereby laying to waste the point of his videos."

'Well, technically BSF are one guarding border and along with CRPF they are killed  lot by terrorist in J&K, so you are right.'
':-( fuck this shit '
"Some people don't like it but onions, tomatoes,  garlic are some things you can expect. The dal in the video was all watery which is okay once a week but if you have to eat that everyday I can imagine someone going mad over it. Plus I'm no cook so I really don't know what kind of spices you can add to it. He mentions cumin seeds which I think are standard ingredient."
'You dont get the point. There is no or very little Dal in the dal. Most of it just water haldi and salt.'
"The Dal has no 'dal' in it."
"So I was right. That is indeed one dumb assassin. \n\nOr...*puts on conspiracy theorist cap*...this was intentional and that murder weapon is now going to be suddenly 'discovered' in the house of someone the govt wants to get rid of.\n "
'Mind used to kill Gauri Lankesh is the same one that killed M M Kalburgi'
"Since there's now ample evidence that there's a clear link between the murders, we should take measures to ban the outfit that coused it and let law take its own course. \n\nI am in full support of banning any right wing org that is involved in terrorism. If we can ban ULFA, Maoist orgs and other Christian groups, why not Hindu ones? \n\nI know it's a pipe dream, but the police forces should be made independent of legislature and executive, and should be directly brought under judiciary. Then again the question arises of who will guard the guards. We have to find checks and balances there too. \n\nI lean to the right and I have no problem with above. Terrorists should be dealt like terrorists. "
'So it can\'t be debated anymore. The killers are right wingers\n\nAs a centre right winger,i am ashamed of what my ideological bed fellows are doing.

(REUTERS/File) People hold placards and candles during a vigil for Gauri Lankesh. (REUTERS/File)\n\nA preliminary forensic analysis of bullets and cartridges found at the site of the September 5 shooting of journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh and those recovered from the killing of Kannada research scholar M M Kalburgi two years ago has revealed that the same 7.65-mm countrymade pistol was used for the two killings.\n\nThis finding has been communicated to the Special Investigation Team that is probing the murder of the 55-year-old journalist and activist, sources involved with the two separate investigations have told The Indian Express.\n\nOn September 12, The Indian Express had reported that investigations had found clues that suggested a link between the two murders.\n\nLankesh was shot dead at her residence in west Bengaluru by an unidentified assailant with a 7.65-mm countrymade pistol around 8 pm while she was opening the gates to her home to park her car after returning from work. Kalburgi was killed at his home in the north Karnataka town of Dharwad at around 8.40 am on August 30, 2015 by an unidentified gunman who rang his doorbell.\n\nPolice recovered the three bullets that pierced Lankesh’s heart and lungs before exiting her body and a bullet that missed her along with the four empty cartridges. While the four cartridges were found at the murder site shortly after the killing, the fatal bullets were found by a search of the crime scene with metal detectors.\n\nInvestigators decided to compare the “ballistic signature” on the bullets and cartridges in the Lankesh case with that of bullets and cartridges in the Kalburgi case. The analysis has reported a match suggesting that one common gun was used in the two killings, sources said. This also suggests that one common outfit or group is behind the two killings, an official said.\n\nGuns are believed to leave unique markings on cartridges and bullets — when the cartridge is struck by the firing pin and the bullet travels through the barrel — on the lines of fingerprints although there are sceptics who caution against using this matching test for crude countrymade weapons.\n\nThe forensic finding from the comparison of the ballistic evidence from the Lankesh and Kalburgi cases when juxtaposed with the forensic analysis of the shooting down of Maharashtra rationalist Govind Pansare, 81, on February 16, 2015 in Kolhapur, suggests that the same gun has been used in three different killings over the last 30 months.\n\nFollowing the murder of Kalburgi and Pansare in 2015, the Karnataka CID had attempted to analyse the evidence in the two cases by comparing striations on the bullets and cartridges used in the two murders and had found a match.\n\nRead | Probe finds clues that point to link between Gauri Lankesh, M M Kalburgi killing\n\nGovind Pansare and his wife Uma Pansare were shot with five bullets from two 7.65-mm countrymade guns. Uma Pansare survived the shooting. The forensic analysis in the Pansare and Kalburgi case revealed that one of the two guns used in the Pansare case in Maharashtra was the same gun used to shoot down Kalburgi in Karnataka.\n\nA further comparison of the ballistic evidence found in the Pansare case with that of evidence in the shooting of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, 69, on August 20, 2013 in Pune revealed that the second gun used to shoot Pansare was the same gun that was used to kill Dabholkar.\n\nIn the 2013 killing of Dabholkar, the motorcycle borne assailant fired four bullets.\n\nThough the investigation of the Kalburgi killing in Karnataka by the CID has not resulted in any headway in finding the killers, the CID has been co-ordinating with the CBI which is probing the Dabholkar murder and a Maharashtra SIT probing the Pansare murder.\n\nThe investigations in the Dabholkar and Pansare cases by the CBI and the Maharashtra SIT suggested the involvement of the radical right-wing outfit, Sanatan Sanstha, in the two killings.\n\nOn the basis of directions issued by the Bombay High Court on January 7, 2016, the Karnataka police shared information from its forensic findings in the Kalburgi case with the CBI and the Maharashtra SIT.\n\nA co-ordination meeting was held by officers of the CBI, the SIT, Maharashtra and the CID, Karnataka on February 17, 2016, to discuss the investigation of the three seemingly linked murder cases. The CBI suggested verification of the ballistic findings of the Karnataka forensic lab through the Directorate of Forensic Services, at Scotland Yard, London.\n\nSources said Scotland Yard confirmed the forensic findings in the Dabholkar, Pansare and Kalburgi cases but did not issue a report for lack of an agreement. The CBI then approached the Gujarat Forensic Science Lab to verify the findings of the Karnataka lab. The Gujarat FSL confirmed the ballistic findings linking the three cases, according to sources.\n\nOn January 20 this year, the Bombay High Court noted that CBI had not been provided a report by the Scotland Yard forensic lab on the findings made by the Karnataka lab in the murders of the rationalists but had accepted a report of the Gujarat FSL and allowed it to be used as evidence by the CBI in the Dabholkar murder case.\n\n“The Scotland Yard Police have informed the CBI in writing that unless and until a Mutual Agreement is arrived at, and in the absence of the clearance from the UK Home Department, it would not be possible to examine the materials and render any definite and conclusive opinion,’’ the court noted. “At this stage, we must also note the fact that the report, now being available for the CBI (the report of the Director of Forensic Sciences, Gujarat), is likely to be placed on the record of the criminal case, and particularly, the Sessions case arising out of the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar.’’\n\nAlthough activists of the Sanatan Sanstha have emerged as the primary suspects in the case, the Karnataka SIT is also pursuing investigations on other lines and on Wednesday questioned family members of Lankesh and some associates whom she had helped move out of the Naxal movement into the mainstream.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

And therefore,the Left too has the same amount of blood on it's hands just as i do.\n\nI am not shy to take on atleast some responsibility as a supporter of the Right for the Assassinations and for the Hindu Terror attacks by the Right.

"Here's a RSS newspaper saying migrants led to increased crime in Mumbai city:\n\n> 1995 नंतर मुंबईत परप्रांतीयांचे लोंढे वाढत गेले. या लोंढय़ांमुळे मुंबईतील गुन्हेगारीचा आलेख चढा राहिला. \n\n\nTranslation: \n\nSince 1995, migrants have increasingly flooded into Mumbai.

'They should divide the number of rapists of a category by total number of people in the category to get the propensity to rape. If (hypothetically), the amount of migrants in Delhi is 1%, then, 20% of rapists is still quite high, if it is 50%, 20% of rapists is lower than average.\n\nMoreover, their definition of "migrant rapists" based on amount of people caught in Delhi is ridiculous. Even migrants committing a crime in a particular place have some probability of getting caught in the same place. This understates the proportion of migrants and overstates the proportion of Delhiites.'
'>**the analysis shows most rapists are school dropouts or illiterate. Only 2% of rapists were those with a college education or a postgraduate degree.**'

'What does this mean\n\n> Profiles of 3,973 rape victims show 1,715 girls were raped in two years: 2015 and till October 15, 2016. \n\nAlso, how is migrant defined in Delhi? 555 out of 3,737 were migrants - what % of population of Delhi would be migrant as per classification?'
"most rape cases are fake anyway, what with 'false promise of marriage' or elopement or revenge forming the majority of rape cases."
'Most rapes committed by Indians, not foreigners.FTFY'
'wtf !!'
"Fuck you, I can't sleep now"
'Depends on how they define a "Delhiite" and a "migrant". Its obvious that a lot of these migrants coming from BIMARU states or anywhere else might have made themselves aadhar or PAN with Delhi address proofs and thus got counted as a "Delhiite" in these stats. Did they bother to filter based on their actual native places?'
'This is simply wordplay and arm chair philosophy . In the context of the article a migrant is someone who has come to Delhi to earn his living, has no or less assets in Delhi and importantly has family outside Delhi. \nMigrants and poor are always blamed for rapes, this article simply tries to bust the myth. '
'> only 2% of rapes are by college educated.\n\nWhat percentage of the population is college educated? Are the reporting rates the same for college educated rapists vs illiterate ones?'
'> only 2% of rapes are by college educated\n\nThat\'s not how statistics work. Most of these rapes are by strangers. But there is a lot of rapes done by people in relationships or people who are known to each other. It could a woman\'s husband. It could also be a single woman\'s "friend". \n\nA lot of rapes never get reported where the victims know each other. There could also be more of a stigma for an upper caste woman to report a rape against another man from a similar community that she knows than a lower-caste woman to report a bunch of unknown thugs. \n\nThere are *huge* unknowns here in terms of lack of reporting, the composition of the crimes etc that we don\'t know about because we can\'t easily measure it. To draw your conclusion from that data vortex, or lack thereof, is foolish to say the least.'
"You're saying that rapes by migrants are more likely to be brutal, violent, and life-threatening? Based off one incident and no actual statistical data?"
'Where did you get the data about violent rapes? Jahan se nikala hai apna comment bhi wahin daal lein.'
"Wtf? So if the rapes aren't brutal they are justified? Wtf is wrong with you? A rape is always brutal. If Delhite rapes a girl it isn't brutal? Wtf you need to distinguish in it? A non life threating rape deserves any less of a punishment?"
'So basically all are bjp/rss supporters. no doubt there.'
"> You are more likely to be molested by someone you know than a stranger.\n\nThat's because you are more likely to be in the same place alone with someone you know than a stranger. Whenever you encounter strangers, you're most likely in a crowd. "
'Blame television and movies for the meme of bunch of tharki thugs standing around a corner, following a stranger girl a few metres, then assaulting and gangraping her.'
'more than half of the cases are fake. Look up that statistic as well.'
'Depends on how they define a "Delhiite" and a "migrant" in this article. Its obvious that a lot of these migrants coming from BIMARU states or anywhere else might have made themselves aadhar or PAN with Delhi address proofs and thus got counted as a "Delhiite" in these stats. Did they bother to filter based on their actual native places?'
"Does it really matter where a rapists' origin place is? He is still a rapist lurking in the nation's capital wreaking havoc."
"One reason of thinking along those lines is that a migrant doesn't have much trail in Delhi. So, when the Delhi police comes looking for him after the crime, there may not be enough people (friends, relatives, etc.) to tell the tale in Delhi (compared to a Delhiite who might have left a lot of trail to catch him), and thus it will be a bit harder to catch the migrant. Thus, the migrant will be a lot more confident of doing a brutal crime in Delhi as compared to a Delhiite."
"\nLook I'm sorry if it painful to think about for you, but stuff like this needs to be discussed. Not because it provides a solution, cause the poster making claims about violent rape is retarded himself, but so that we can look for how to stop crimes of this nature once we've stormed past the stupidity. "
'Besides, the conditions in Bihar/UP is even worse than Delhi. At least in Delhi, these crimes are reported. In crime zones like Meerut and Saharanpur and Wasseypur, not a bird will know if a woman gets raped and "disposed off" overnight.'
"> Does it really matter where a rapists' origin place is? \n\nGenerally no, but isn't that what the title of this article suggests?"
'> Thus, the migrant will be a lot more confident of doing a brutal crime in Delhi as compared to a Delhiite.\n\nSo purely a speculation, then?'
"Stopping assault is important, not debating these points like who is a migrant, how migrants can escape undetected, who is educated or not. Assault is assault and that's what we should be looking at stopping"
'> also we need to distinguish between brutal Violent rapes like Nirbhaya are of 5 migrants, most rapes are not Life threatening\n\nWhat do you want to distinguish in it? That immigrants rapes are more violent? You want data on that right? You want the data on how many girls were killed after the rape so you can again blame the immigrants over Delhites.  '
'> At least in Delhi, these crimes are reported. In crime zones like Meerut and Saharanpur and Wasseypur, not a bird will know if a woman gets raped and "disposed off" overnight.\n\nThank you for your thorough and scientific research into the matter.'
'Also the Police are more likely to be harsher on migrants because of their lack of contacts and influence.'
'Not unless you hae some evidence. Here\'s a dictionary definition: "a supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation."'
'>  made on the basis of limited evidence \n\nThere is much more than **limited** evidence. Nirbhaya is a classic example of that limited evidence.'
'No worries, sorry if I came off as patronising.'
'isn\'t there even1 example of violent rape and murder by non-migrants? For your "hypothesis" to be a hypothesis, you need to meet both those conditions - evidence for migrants indulging in rape/murder and lack of the same for non-migrants. And that will only get you to "migrants may indulge in these heinous acts more often than residents. "Thus, the migrant will be a lot more confident of doing a brutal crime in Delhi as compared to a Delhiite." assumes mental state and reasoning of the migrant vs that of a non-migrant, which is untestable.'

He is also said to have received threat calls allegedly from the education mafia, the last over a month ago.\n\nA resident of Mahalaxmi society in Punagam area in Varachha, Rajesh’s father Vinay Savaliya told the police that his son had left house on Tuesday evening for a friend’s construction site at Pardi in Valsad district. Rajesh was given a ride in a car by one of his friend’s mother and sister who reportedly dropped him on NH-8.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Rajesh’s friend Vijay Patel received a call from city’s Navsari Civil Hospital about him being severely injured.\n\nPolice said Vijay, along with five others, reached the hospital and learnt that the 108 ambulance services had received a call about a person found lying by the roadside near Sai Baba temple on NH-8 in Navsari. Vijay shifted Rajesh, who had received severe injuries on his head, left shoulder and stomach, to a private hospital in Surat. Vijay informed Rajesh’s family members who also reached the hospital. On Wednesday night, however, Rajesh was declared dead by doctors.\n\nRajesh was cremated at Ashwanikumar cremation home in Varachha on Thursday afternoon. Several RTI activists attended his funeral.\n\nThe Punagam Police have started a probe after registering a case of accidental death in this regard. “We have called Rajesh Savaliya’s friend who has a construction site at Pardi in Valsad district to record his statements.

'>It is the job of the teacher to keep the student disturbed\n\nLook, I agree with you in essence that teachers should be afforded the right to freedom of expression and that certainly involves a lot of disturbing ideas. However, The primary of the teacher is to keep the students **informed** and strong personal opinions can often come in the way of that. I am commenting on this specific instance, I am referring to the idea in general that teachers should keep their personal opinions out of the classroom and sexuality is large part of that. That is not to say that teachers should be avoid important pervasive opinions that may be prove be disturbing to some but only that the teacher should be able distinguish between their personal opinion and opinions that constitute their broader subject. I say this only because I have had some really unsavory experiences with highly opinionated professors myself and it can be very annoying and really become a hurdle in the process of education.  '
'I was a student of his till this Thursday and I can tell you from first hand experience that this is simply not true. He just wants to play the “gay” card because he seems to be under the impression that he’ll go out with a bang. He’s a little bitch. He would swear in class. He would expect us to be tolerant of his opinions while blatantly disregarding everyone else’s. Whenever someone went to him for help with their research papers, he would call them shit and make them write theses about HIS opinions on what a text should mean. He would also throw tantrums and literally walk out of class after insulting us, despite it being against the rules of the college. He had been warned several times about this. \r\nNot to mention that he had submitted his resignation on Sunday stating that he wouldn’t mind if he was relieved immediately or after his contract. The allegations were made by parents of minors in several classes who were not comfortable with his being overly sexual. The management had to act immediately which was the reason for his immediate discharge. Also if you think this happened because he was gay, you’re a fucking idiot. He has been fired from numerous institutions not for his being gay, but him being an asshole of a teacher. Granted he was a good teacher but he was a very childish person who seemed to be under the impression that he was better than everyone else. \r\nHe also shit talked the administration on numerous occasions and always found an opportunity to squeeze that into our classes as well. He has ranted and ranted and ranted and I am tired of it. Another student posted a response to this particular rant of his and he just called him a brain dead stalker. \r\nAlso don’t go talking shit about our English department. They are the best teachers I’ve ever had in my life. They are the nicest teachers who have ever taught me and I wouldn’t mind standing by them no matter what it costs. Granted the administration has it’s flaws and I’m not particularly fond of Victor Lobo, but this institute is one of the most liberal I’ve ever seen in Bangalore. If you expect the English department to risk their jobs for a manbaby who isn’t used to getting what he wants, then I suggest you pull your head out of your ass and look at the obvious. No one in their right mind would hire a gay professor (fully knowing that he was gay) and THEN fire him on the grounds that he was gay. Are you fucking retarded? \r\nAlso PS he’s been calling us pussies because “we won’t stand up to the adminstration” in other words side with him. \r\n'

And there have been countless religious idiots. Think about why that is.\n\nIf you want to see the value of the story in action, visit a cancer hospital. Anywhere in the world. If you are a doctor who has to tell parents their kid is going to die, what will you tell them? \n\nJust go visit and see what happens. Doesn't matter which country and how advanced their counseling and science and technology is nobody has rational answers in those moments. Think about what you personally would say in such a situation.\n\nIf you don't have a good story to put in their heads in those moments that you fully believe, its not just the child that dies its the minds of all the people that connected to the life of that child. That is what a good story of God is able to do. And has done everytime there is suffering that the advancements of the world have no answers for.\n\nAs long as suffering exists that people can do nothing about, God will exist. When you attack God instead of the people who do misguided things in God's name, then please remember you are attacking the one story that people who are suffering or are in pain have when they have nothing else.\n"

"Agreed. But I'd argue that this guy is logical, and does not grade students just because their views are contrary.\n\nIve heard of a guy who got quite high marks even though his paper argued how prostitution is wrong (and the professor is openly *for* legalization of prostitution). What he argued may have been against the professor's opinion, however, he graded people solely on the criteria that was laid out to judge the learning - English. More specifically, proper structuring of the paper. I'd say this was most essential considering how CBSE teaches none of it (and actually promotes the contrary). The guy taught and graded reasonably without letting his personal opinions get in the way, IMO. And this is a guy who didn't mind failing 80% of the class if their papers weren't upto expectations. Opinions did not mind to him while grading, course outcomes/objectives did."
"The amount of support he's getting on his Facebook is insane considering he's in the wrong here. Such blatant bullshit and the media portrays him as the victim such is expected of mainstream media I guess."
"Well this certainly changes things. For a self-proclaimed gay activist, he sure did a lot of damage by hiding his tantrums and misbehaviour behind the gay card. What a fucking shame. I really hope this doesn't come out to bite other LGBT faculty in the ass because one guy would rather throw tantrums about discrimination than abide by basic classroom decorum."
'>Whenever someone went to him for help with their research papers, he would call them shit and make them write theses about HIS opinions on what a text should mean. \n\nI am not sure if he is talking particularly in this context, but I would leave this here:\n\n>St. Joseph\'s Update 2# So it has come to my knowledge that a certain Prithvi Chandavarkar has written an fb post and anonymously circulated a whatsapp post about my sacking. I read it and the incoherence, illogic and poor thinking in it helped me identify him immediately.He was in the MA II class I helped with their Research paper. Just to clarify a few points: a) Having talks by LGBT individuals is not the same as hiring LGBT individuals. That I was the only out LGBT individual in the college says great things about the college\'s inclusive policies b) This deluded and somewhat creepy man claims to have knowledge about my past. Good to know that students are stalkers. The homophobia in his insinuations about my past is obvious. c) Of course I did not make eye contact with him because I make eye contact only with students who are alive in class, who have a brain and who are listening c) He threatens violence and warns me. I will be crossing him soon with my lawyer so we will see what is in store for whom d) The English Department is indeed so liberal that the HoD sent a message to all teachers today saying they should not talk to the media and if they do should give the college version or say they know nothing at all. It is so liberal that students were told to keep out of it all and not speak to the media either c)The college is so liberal that all the posts below show it really well, especially the Principal\'s comment about gay couples. I will be examining his open letter with my lawyer and his veiled homophobia, his open threats and much else (My students have sent me screenshots of it all and copies of it all). A true product of this institution he proves himself to be. The actual open letter reeks of misinformation, lies, vicious homophobia and unfounded allegations a) I did not abandon any students. I still had my four and took on a fifth till my last day in college and also offered to continue to supervise them as only 10 days are left for submission b) I was not assigned to the class at all. I volunteered to help as the MA research for many students was in pitiable shape and I helped many students get up to scratch c) I wait for an official complaint from any student that I was "creepily sexual" or "interfered with their private lives." These are serious, libellious claims and I am talking to my lawyer about this post and letter. Ditto with charges of "similar conduct" and "abhorrent behaviour." I will not let him get away with any of this. This is the sort of rank homophobia and unbelieveable violence that we have to face every day of our lives in institutions as LGBT people where we both do not make eye contact but are creepily sexual, where people make claims about our lives and pasts with absolutely no knowledge of anything about our lives having seen us for a couple of months.'
'Haha. Sad that this makes sense.'

If you\'re not making the student think critically, or for that matter allowing a space where criticism (of anything) is accepted, you\'re failing as an educational institution.'

Instead, this gentle soul simply asks me to compensate her by doing something nice for her. \n\nIn 8th and 9th, I had a principal who could be classified as evil, tbh. She once called a girl student in her cabin and insulted her so bad, that the girl committed suicide the next day. "

So, it does not make sense to have him fired about that issue. \n\nMy guess is that he really did instigate the students as the management claims he did, and maybe some students complained and now, he is hiding behind his regular 'get-out-of-jail' free card. There is no way that the management is going to out the students who actually did complain. \n\n"

Rueing the lack of civic sense prevailing among the passengers, he said the toilet, which is state-of-the-art combination of a bio and a vacuum toilet, began to stink an hour into the journey as people did not bother to use the flush. **“The toilet was soiled and was stinking as the people didn’t even bother to flush properly after they used it. In fact, I had to flush twice until it was clean enough to be used.”**"

"WTF is vegetarian water? I can't even!?"
'Almost all water is non-veg. Because animals (including cows) drown or just naturally die in water bodies or they may die on land (their remains get buried into earth and make contact with ground-water), thus making it non-veg. Inevitably thus, there are microscopic traces of animals in all water, be it in a flowing river or sea or the rain itself.   \n\nThe only way to make 100% veg hindu-approved water is to either extract water from a celestial body which has no life (no chance of non veg) or to synthesize water in a lab using pure hydrogen and oxygen.

'>> Fake accent\n\nI have no comment on other parts of OP\'s post but I think I need to clarify something on "accents," especially what the OP perceives to be a fake one.\n\nThe bottom line is you must speak the way the natives do otherwise they\'ll have a hard time understanding you and will resort to "pardon me", "come again" again and again. As it is, our mannerisms and expressions are different from theirs. \n\nHow would you like it if a foreigner even after living in India for a long time speaks pronounces "Himalaya" as "Himulya" even after hearing it day in and day out?\n\nThe second thing is that what is considered "accent" is composed of two different things - correct pronunciation and local intonation.\n\nMany Indians (and other foreigners) start pronouncing words the local way if they\'ve lived in a place long enough. And probably imbibe some of the intonation too. There\'s nothing wrong with that. This is only to be expected. The problem is with people who don\'t. For example, some Indians I know still pronounce tuition as "tyooshun", intuition as "intyooshun"  and Connecticut as "Kunnectikut."\n\nThe third thing is a perspective from the other side. When someone from India comes to a client side their accent stands out and by that I mean both pronunciation and tone. Added to that is the usage of somewhat dated constructs and constructs that aren\'t very nuanced. The last is only to be expected in any foreigner.\n\nSo OP, please ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Was the pronunciation of these NRIs wrong?\n\n2. Was their tone different from that of natives?\n\n3. Did they have a hard time communicating with the natives? Did you?\n\n4. Were their language more nuanced than yours? Were there subtleties that you missed? The last you will know only after you reflect upon it after the fact.\n\n(The above is a generalization and may not apply to you).\n'
'Lots of these NRI\'s that complain about India often have bad relations with their families in India. So to their friends they say stuff like "the polution/traffic/crime/poverty/corruption is too bad, thats why I dont go anymore." But often times they\'ve fought with their families back home thus they never visit, which creates a sense of alienation for them from their birthplace thus they come with justifications.\n\nThough note that often they do have legitimate complains. \n\n(my experience from the people I hear in Australia, I\'m really really lucky to have a great family in Aus and India).'

'Dude, last year my dad\'s college friend( who settled in the US in the 80s) along with his wife and daughter came to India and stayed with us during the visit. The dad was relatively OK, but his daughter and wife had a huge superiority complex, Every time we went to some place they would shit on it about how filthy,dirty and smelly the place was ,every small thing starting from an intersection to the interior of a car to the quality of air was compared with the US, furthermore the daughter would always keep distance from me(not like I was interested in her, even avg Indian girls are better looking) and thought all guys were perverts. The last straw for me was when we went to a local vada pav shop and the daughter ranted about how unhealthy India is and this is the reason why India doesn\'t go ahead living in filth like pigs (this is exactly what she said), I got very angry but drank all the humiliation for those 2 weeks. While they were going I just told them to visit "my" country again.'

"Looks like you are dealing with one of those self-hating NRI type. It seems like by telling you all that is messed up with India he wants to validate the decision of leaving, as if he is not sure if he made the right decision. \n\nThe other things that these type of people do is internalize the Western media and the general public narrative on India, which mostly focuses on the miserable aspects (poverty, rapes, female foeticide etc...). To prove that they have completely adopted their new homeland, it almost becomes imperative for them to profess more nationalism than the average white guy. They also claim to be a subject matter expert on India, even though most of them probably haven't been to most parts of it and have a very surface knowledge of the complex history of the Indian subcontinent. It can be frustrating to deal with these type of people especially in a work situation, but I think the way to do is sort of point out the contradictions in their stories. A famous man once said this about India\n\n>“The frustrating thing about India, is that whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true.” \n\n\nThe irony is that if they think by having a piece of paper which says you are American makes you *American*, I can only feel sorry for them. India being an ancient civilization and only a modern nation state, I would argue that what passport you have doesn't really make a difference, other than for traveling, you are still *Indian* in the eyes of the world.\n\nThe fact is it will probably take them 2-3 generations of intermixing to truly be considered *American* or any of their other adopted homelands, and even then that might not happen. Just ask all the 2nd and 3rd generation Indians in the UK."
"What makes you think they expect YOU to give a fuck?     \nYou don't know their story when they bitch about this country. Hell open today's any local newspaper, you'll start bitching too. Just because they don't have citizenship, doesn't mean they can't criticise. "

The reason we bitch and rant is because we wanted to make a living within India. But thanks to hundreds of issues, we just can't. So, yes, we might happily stay in other country because we faced issues in our own. But that actually justifies the reason for bitching. The reason we are willingly giving up citizenship is because India is worse than Trump's America. And no one here is willing to even accept faults, much less fix them. "

The army argued that this limited service life should be safeguarded for war. \n\n* The third reason was the impropriety of deploying military troops for what it considered a private function\n\nSo has Sri^2 AOL event has become more important than the Army and its legitimate claims for preserving those artifacts which have limited service life? Have the Army men become so dispensable for this Modi govt?\n\nSo much for "Soldier standing at the border"!'

"Doesn't take away from the fact that activists and NGT were pleading this event not take place on the fragile plains, and that the event was green lit at the last moment. Just go somewhere else man..go to Rann of Kutch in Modiland. Anything from 13 to 120 cr is literally peanuts for the Govt and AOL, but the recovery will take hell of a lot of *time*, no matter how much money is thrown at it. For once I'd like people to look at this from an environmental perspective."
"Let's say the figure is say 1 crore and not higher or even lower. So we can keep aside on the discussion on quantum of damage. Is your premise also that there is no ecological damage? Is your premise that if the damage is monetarily low say not 13 crore then it's Ok for aol not to be held responsible and the govt so the tax payers foot the bill for a mismanaged event which was Organised for and by a private party? If not, both the aol and govt are guilty irrespective of quantum of monetary loss. Govt even more than aol as they are afterall guardians of public resources."
"> Is your premise also that there is no ecological damage?\n\nno.\n\n>Is your premise that if the damage is monetarily low say not 13 crore then it's Ok for aol not to be held responsible\n\nno, it doesn't depend on fine. The ministry that gave permission is responsible imo. AOL neither acted unlawfully because it got all the required permissions before conducting the event and nor does AOL has consultants of it's own who would have told it that this is the amount of damage that will occur to nature. So AOL took the only path it had, go with the permissions from authorities who know what the hell could go wrong."
'Thats how all tribunals in the country are constituted (including income tax tribunals, electricity tribunals, etc). Half will be made of technical members and the other half of judicial members.

">nor does AOL has consultants of it's own who would have told it that this is the amount of damage that will occur to nature\n\nI cannot digest this. An organisation that takes pride in ~~restoring dead rivers~~ rejuvenating rivers and shit ton of environmental work AND being aware of the heavy resistance from environmentalists for this event couldn't be a tad bit responsible?\n\nEDIT: no dead rivers restored :)"
"I see no problem with 120 Cr to 42 Crore to whatever. It just proves that whosover it is has managed to arm twist the panel to fudge the numbers to ensure that liability on Sri^2 becomes minimal. Since Modi is personally involved, I wouldn't be surprised if the panel recommends no fine tomorrow. That is what is  called a Clean Chit^TM\n\nSo btw, how many crores would the damage have to be for the supporters to accept that Yamuna damage is serious?"
'> An organisation that takes pride in restoring dead rivers \n\nsource?\n\nAFAIK after this controversy only they have launched a project to clean 7 rivers, but still **restoring dead rivers?** seems a bit too far fetched'

However, since India\'s exports are composed entirely of water-buffalo meat or carabeef, the bans will not affect the figures cited in the report.\n\nSource: http://time.com/3833931/india-beef-exports-rise-ban-buffalo-meat/\n\n>That way people can cut down on consumption but have it occasionally\n\nYou\'re talking about taxing exports, which is highly unlikely.

'Don\'t forget the context here.\n\nNGT guys were specifically de-empowered because everyone was yapping about "land reform". What was that about, you ask? India actually had a *real* environment minister with strong laws to back him up in 2011-2013 when the crony capitalists were ripping up the land.\n\nHe got part of the blame for so-called "policy paralysis", and then they shifted him out and changed the laws.

Then they said that there should be no NEW construction within 10 km of the sanctuary, clearly aimed at extorting money from builders in Noida.\n\nThe court finally ruled that the limit should be 100m, not 10 km, which was a big slap on the faces of NGT.\n\n'

"Sure, i am going to get downmodded to oblivion, but i am going to call horseshit on this. It is not the police's job to ensure if you are wearing seatbelts or are wiping your arse properly after taking a shit. Their job is to ensure that you obey traffic rules and do not represent a threat to others on the road, either pedestrians or commuters.\n\nYou don't want to wear a helmet or a seatbelt? Fine. Increase your risk of serious brain damage and death. But it is on your own dime and time. My point is, you cannot enforce a law that prevents people from being utterly stupid."
'Its still a crime according to law'
'No shame in watching it.'
'I know you mean well but civil asset seizure is a big deal and i not sure I trust our corrupt traffic cops to not abuse that significant power. If they werent currupt, we already would have safe roads relatively speaking We have a series of heavy fines which were increased a few years ago for violations. The implementation is what is lacking. Implement the laws, issue multiple strike warnings and "three strikes and out" policy etc. People will spend on things if that is the cheaper alternative. Make it really fucking expensive to drive without a helmet or seatbelt and it will change. '
"Here's why you're wrong:\n\nSeatbelts and helmets are often the difference between an accident where you get up, laugh, and walk away, and when your family get to go to your funeral, or worse, see you in the hospital as a vegetable.\n\nNow, those things may or may not be your business and not the police's, but the CLEANUP of those crashes IS the police's business.  In a crash where noone is hurt badly, the wrecks can just be pushed off the road, and traffic can proceed normally.  On the other hand, a FATAL crash is always cordoned off and you have a bunch of police just standing around, contemplating the mysteries of their bellybuttons, and traffic is held up for *hours.*  The *best* possible outcome from this is that a few thousand people are greatly inconvenienced, some of whom will lose their job because they were late to work.  What is just as likely, however, is that such a traffic jam will spawn any number of subsidiary wrecks and injuries, and god knows how many people will be hurt or killed because of them.\n\nTHAT is why helmets and seatbelts are a matter of public interest."
'You got to be kidding me right? Who will cleanup the street when you die on the street with blood strewn all across the road? Maybe your accident will cause some govt trucks/bus to run late thereby missing on revenues.. whatever be the reason, the biggest point is that govt will lose another tax paying citizen because the moron didnt care for his own life.'
'> Why should the State interfere if I am willing to risk my life. \n\nYou need to prove that in case of an accident you will ONLY "risk your life".'
'Cause you are a fucking risk to others '
'I agree with you on "civil asset seizure" problem but "three strikes and out" policy won\'t work. No one has a license that they give a damn except for id and address proof.\n\nHowever i have to say, nothing is more costly than seizing vehicles.\n'

It's bad for business and reputation of India for a destination of doing business.\n\nNow companies like PVR are fucked. Their IMAX and gold services would now be all under 200. Which means their regular screens ought to be cheaper than that, so they'll be selling tickets at half the price (maybe 160) than what they were on Friday (290) which would plummet their revenues and hence is unfair for a private business who built their own business without any government help. Not to mention that about ~~15 percent~~ **\\*30 percent** of price of ticket is the tax that government takes.\n\nIt's like you opened a high end restaurant from your money and years after selling your Biryani at 400 a plate, the government suddenly limits it to Rs. 200 . Now you paid for establishing the restaurant from your own capital, you paid for the chicken, rice, monthly wages of employees, the electricity, the rented parking, etc. But now your revenues are half. How do you expect them to sustain their businesses? Isn't it similarly unfair for government to cap prices of private companies? \n\nNo shit we are the worst at ease of doing business.

Should we cap gold prices to 300Rs per 10 grams? \n\nIf govt take such decision then most likely these businesses will slowly die out OR govt will have to divert a tremendous amount of money to these businesses to keep them afloat. \n\nGovt should ensure that businesses aren't using monopoly or price fixing (competitors joining hand to decide on price) and create an environment for competition (that leads to more choices and better prices), but price fixing will lead to either bad business conditions or huge subsidies. "
"Okay, let me try to explain this. Consider these three things :\n\n1. Is it a good idea to have a same price limit on all the different classes of trains? That is 1AC, 2AC, 3AC, Sleeper, General have all same prices cap on them? No, right? What's the difference between the different classes of trains? Affordability and experience. The more you pay, the better experience you get. The basic services are given in sleeper but the experience isn't the same and you have to pay extra for a better experience. Therefore, the umbrella ban disrupts this demand and supply of better movie halls as one type of service might inherently have a higher cost than other one (Eg: IMAX vs Gold vs Regular). In Bangalore all of them have same price cap of Rs. 200, which is terrible.\n\n2. Now, if you start selling all the different classes tickets at same price then the demand for the better seats will just skyrocket which will disrupt the demand and supply.\n\n3. There are no official price caps in Hyderabad, the prices vary based on demand and affordability which brings me to the final point. Affordability, demand and supply. The rent prices in Mumbai are higher than any other metro for a reason, demand and supply. Similarly the prices for movies is higher in Bangalore than other cities because of the same reason, demand and affordability. People in Bangalore have higher paying capacity, there's a lot of money to be earned in IT (I earned 25K one month working part time while being in college that's how much money is there) and the seats available are limited, therefore the higher prices because the multiplexes are houseful anyway. Therefore, by introducing a price cap you are disrupting the demand and supply gap. There is a lot of demand, very limited supply (availability of seats) and Rs. 200 is pretty affordable for an average salaried worker in Bangalore, so the supply won't be able to match up to the demand and the parameter which keeps this demand/supply in check if affordability but that is totally disrupted by government (Rs. 200 cap).\n\nI hope you understand what I mean when I say that move like this disrupts demand and supply. Yes, that's a good move for your driver. Good for him, but that's bad for businesses, that's bad for multiplex owners, that is bad for average consumers who have the money because no matter how much money they have, they cannot avail better facilities (gold class, IMAX) as there just isn't any availability anymore because of the reduces costs.\n\nAnd worst of all, they are controlling a business they never invested in. It's like if your neighbor is selling his apartment for 50L but you put a cap of 40L on it. Who are you to put a price cap on something that belongs to your neighbor. Similarly, who are government to put a price cap on something that doesn't belong to them which are private multiplexes. This is unfair and bad for businesses."

Simple things like treated the underprivileged with respect simply isn't what our religion is about unfortunately, and it's become more about rituals, festivals and bizarre rules, or rote recitation. Even if there is great philosophy in vedanta or somewhere, it's not really something most people care about, and most of the priest class just serve the function of taken donations or performing pujas.\n\nSo there you have it, the 3 pillars of society that build good morality have all failed in India: education, parenting and religion"

Discussions about putting people on jeeps and, of course, human rights abuses are wholly valid; discussions about whether or not surgical strikes happened tend to veer towards the pointless side, to say the least."
'Indian military runs on taxpayer money. We pay their bill, so we have the right to criticize them. However, Indian military should be criticized about their job. Like, failure to stop Kashmir insurgency, people being tied to a jeep and lower level soldiers doing personal work of high-ranking officials.\n\nHowever, we should not question their integrity, like a surgical strike. Those decisions are made the civilian government.'
'army cant prevent terrorists from strolling inside their bases, and then it takes almost a week to kill these terrorists inside the base, army does a surgical strike but terrorists and weapons still manage to cross the border, army cant even handle a few stones thrown at them and generals talk abt having a war with pakistan and china at the same time, and on top of this if you criticise the army they start crying that they are being unfairly targeted'
'So story time, I had couple of Air force friends on my FB list. After the URI incident where Indian military personnels were killed. Like it was piece of cake. I wondered wtf? I posted this "I thought military security is tight. Nothing can go past their acute vigilance. Why were they even sleeping?"\n\nThat triggered those guys and were having at me like I made some anti-national, inflammatory statement, like how I disrespected\u200b the Indian flag, the Army, Mother India etc. And also some what looked like a 4 pages answer sheet about Soldier\'s dilemma, Deshbhakti quotes, and one line that I now vaguely recall " Those who criticize it\'s soldiers, lives in a already failed nation"  something along those lines. One even commented what looked like a threat to me " If you were in the Army base, I\'d have had you shot" to " I think you are an Army reject, hence you hate us."\n\nI really had the most cringest level of conversation with those 2 guy\'s friends and family and people who are total stranger to me. Name calling and what not. All I did was ask how and why our defence system was failed. And in response they told me to ask the govt, not them. "It\'s the government who are corrupt, not us."\n\nI noped the fuck out after that.It\'s been 2 years and I am glad they aren\'t on my FB list.'

'surgical strikes did happen. but the casuality figure is wrong.    '
'What about when they rape women in Manipur and nonone gets punished?'
"> However, we should not question their integrity, \n\nNot even when they give us the reason to wonder about their integrity, say, for example by illegally setting up a spying agency, or by moving armed formations towards the capital when the army chief is frothing at the mouth, threatening the democratically elected government over extending his tenure by a few months? \n\nHow about when they give out prime land in bombay in the name of housing kargil martyrs, only to corner flats together with politicians and babus, with practically none going to the martys' relatives?"

"I'd say they should check the facts and shit before saying something publicly"
"Arvind Kejriwal and numerous other opposition leaders were expressing skepticism of the surgical strikes and were demanding 'proof' of it. I'm denying what you're saying, but this is what my comments were addressing."

But yeah scam happened that's why they are out. That's how criticism works. Don't matter even if you flew a rocket, if you screw up you are done."
'Who decides what criticism makes sense and contributes to ongoing political discourse? '
"> Arvind Kejriwal and numerous other opposition leaders were expressing skepticism of the surgical strikes and were demanding 'proof' of it. \n\nSo what?"
'Yeah as long as "invalid criticism" is not censored by the government. Criticism of any criticism is fine but censorship is not.  '
"I'm not sure where you got the idea that I'm suggesting the government should be stamping certain criticism as 'valid' and others as 'invalid'. \n\nMy comment (and the editorial OP linked) is addressing what we in the public sphere discuss and the criticisms we advance. All I'm saying is civil society - as in us and the media - should give definitely give credence to criticism that's constructive, aims to address a problem(s), and isn't just to score political points by putting the government in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. \n\nWe should support media outlets devoting airtime to having experts and government ministers/MPs discuss/debate complicated issues like the ethics of tying up protesters to jeeps or human rights issues by the military. These sort of criticisms make sense. We shouldn't support media outlets devoting airtime to nonsensical yelling about whether or not surgical strikes occurred or how pro or anti national people are. That's pointless criticism - the Army isn't going to release top secret combat footage (if it even exists; not like special forces are recording shooting terrorists on their iPhones)."
"Who questioned ? Was there evidence? \n\nUS conducts hundreds of SF ops all over the world yearly. They don't answer anyone especially if it's for 'proof'. Hell, they charged Snowden as a spy !, While possible one is now president. \n\nFirst learn how different systems work. US don't have pseudo liberals like here. Military service is part of life there. No one dares to question it's legitimacy. Here people are so disconnected to it's security Institutions that they think it's below him. Learn to keep your policies separate from matters of national security."
"Did you read the chain of comments above? I was countering the notion that the 'surgical strikes are made up' thing was just something pro-government channels were setting up as a strawman."
'Your comment contains the implication that if it is not "valid" then we should turn a blind eye to its suppression.  The matter at hand is the suppression of any criticism of the army and that includes those "invalid" criticisms as well. One need not pay attention to such criticisms they feel are "invalid" but that doesn\'t mean they should support or even ignore the suppression and intimidation of those who make the criticism.'
'dafaq? What weird idea of democracy do you have in mind?'
'So I decided that the strikes were fake & the criticism was valid.'

'> People open their mouth without having any knowledge on the working of an institution and hide behind the argument of right to criticise.\n\n\nmost people also vote without much knowledge on the working of *any* institution or what they are voting for. \n\nbut that is not the point. in the context of this article, i meant that in our system, people can publicly criticise the military and that is an important thing to protect. we can choose to agree or disagree with those stated opinions later.'

"Extremely ignorant image.\n\n1) India doesn't have a traditional dress. There are many different cultures. I wonder if Salwar kameez worn by the majority of Indian women is traditional or not? It was worn by Mughals and Muslims before being adopted by everyone else.  What exactly is traditional? Many still don't like to wear salwar kameez like Kerala women because it's not their culture. \n\n2) Muslim women only wear the abaya when they go out. They wear the same dress as everyone else in presence of close relatives. \n\n3) That image also includes a lot of Arab countries. Niqab predates Islam. It was the culture to cover your face in many parts of the world even before Islam. So that image is idiotic.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_pre-Islamic_Arabia\n\n4) Right wingers of India like to ape the right wingers of America etc not realizing that Muslims have been here for a long long time. Purdah etc has existed for a long time. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdah \n\n>Although purdah is commonly associated with Islam, many scholars argue that veiling and secluding women pre-dates Islam; these practices were commonly found among various groups in the Middle East such as Druze, Christian, and Jewish communities.[1] For instance, the burqa existed in Arabia before Islam, and the mobility of upper-class women was restricted in Babylonia, Persian, and Byzantine Empires before the advent of Islam.[2] Historians believe purdah was acquired by the Muslims during the expansion of the Arab Empire into modern-day Iraq in the 7th century C.E and that Islam merely added religious significance to already existing local practices of the times.[3]\n\n5) The same guys on Reddit who upvote your comment wear pant+shirt and majority of them wear the dresses of their colonial masters and then shit on dresses which have existed in India before their colonialism. \n\n6) All this nonsense here saying you should go back to desert if you want to wear niqab etc. I wonder if all those who wear western dresses and follow western culture should go to America/UK? \n\n"

Whether Islam is itself a fundamentalist religion or not is secondary to the actions of its followers, which in this case are reprehensible. Similarly to the minority attacks that have escalated over last three years. \n\nWe are primarily outraged because the actions (or similar ones) have direct support of the government. In this case the government would be heavy on the stabber; in other situations the stabbers are indirectly affiliated to the Central party and their cronies. The majority in India will support Sonu Nigam, as I do too, but does the majority support killers of Akhlaq and Pehlu Khan? Outraging there is more important because if unchecked, sooner or later we will also start murdering people who *offend* us, oh but wait, havent we already?\n\nWe are outraged there because Hinduism was supposed to be different. We all unanimously agree that nothing in Hinduism tells us to kill people from other religion. We are now going down same path, where we felt superior to Muslims when they were blowing themselves up.

They kept screaming that they were transporting buffaloes and not cows. All this fell on deaf ears.” \n\n> That is how cattle trader Mohammad Latif recalled an attack on three of his friends late on Saturday night near Kalkaji temple in southeast Delhi as their truck carrying 14 buffaloes was stopped by men claiming to be members of an animal rights organisation called People for Animals. The men beat up the three cattle traders, leaving them bleeding from their noses and foreheads. The men alleged that the cattle traders were taking the animals to be slaughtered – an act that is perfectly legal.\n\n> Until Sunday evening, the police had not been able to arrest any of the members of the mob, who, the authorities initially claimed, belonged to an organisation called People for Animals. Though they made little headway in identifying the assailants, the police did register cases against the three men who were beaten up. The authorities charged Rizwan, Ashu and Kamil under Indian Penal Code provisions for killing and maiming cattle and sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. \n\n> Despite the police claims that People for Animals were involved in the incident, the organisation’s chair, Maneka Gandhi, denied that the organisation had anything to do with it. In fact, she claimed that the organisation does not have a separate unit for Delhi. However, on Sunday morning, the organisation’s website listed the names of both Gaurav Gupta and Saurabh Gupta (as well as three others) under the head “PFA Delhi”. By Sunday evening, though, the page had been taken down.\n\n\n'
"The media should call these Gau Rakshaks what they truly are - Hindu terrorists. Fucking vile, disgusting cult followers committing crimes in the name of 'Gau Raksha'. \n\nThe police are a joke.

But according to the patrolling police it\'s is very unsafe to come out at night (In Mumbai) because somebody would kill me or do something, just coz of the fear of visiting chowki at this time of night and getting bullied by these people of law, I said " I will leave as soon as I finish my ciggi" and he steps out of the vehicle and threaten me intimidating posture and call out some cuss words in local language. I have no choice, but to leave. \n\nI kept thinking all the way to home that am I free to come out at night? Was there a curfew? Is there any law that prohibits me to step out at night? And is police implying that their way of providing safety to people is by locking them in their houses?\n\nThis is the a situation in Mumbai (not a sensitive place as for now) just 500 mtrs away from residential area. I can only imagine what these people in hostile area would be treated.\n\nOur police needs to know law. And what they can and cannot do.

(PTI Photo, representational) A young one-horned rhino trying to rise above water on the National Highway from the flooded grassland in Kothari village near Kaziranga National Park in Nagaon district of Assam. (PTI Photo, representational)\n\nTHE GOVERNMENT has prohibited the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from filming in India’s national parks and wildlife sanctuaries for “irreparable damage done to India’s reputation”. Imposed with “immediate effect” on April 10, the five-year ban applies to filming for BBC documentaries and news reports.\n\nAs first reported by The Indian Express on February 15, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had in a showcause notice issued two days earlier criticised the BBC for “grossly erroneous” reporting and recommended the blacklisting of the BBC’s South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt for a documentary that highlighted the government’s “ruthless anti-poaching strategy” for the Kaziranga tiger reserve in Assam.\n\nOn February 27, the NTCA issued a memorandum, asking the chief wildlife wardens of all tiger-range states and field directors of tiger reserves not to grant filming permission to the BBC for five years.\n\nThe ministry’s April 10 order upholds and extends the ban from tiger reserves to all national parks and sanctuaries.\n\nThe latest order refers to the NTCA’s communication on February 27, regarding the “violation of terms and conditions of filming documentary by the BBC News, South Asia Bureau, New Delhi”.\n\nIt further states that the ministry “examined the matter” and found that the BBC “projected a negative, malicious and sensational portrayal of India’s conservation success story at Kaziranga Tiger Reserve”; “deviated from the original script submitted to the Ministry of External Affairs and NTCA”; and, did “irreparable damage. to India’s reputation. by telecasting the film worldwide”.\n\nWhen contacted, a BBC spokesperson said: “The authorities’ reaction to this report on an important global issue like the appropriate way to combat poaching is extremely disappointing. The programme was balanced, impartial and accurately reported what we found on arrival. It covered both the successes achieved through India’s conservation policies and the challenges, which includes the impact on communities living next to the parks. We approached the relevant government authorities to ensure their position was fully reflected but they declined to take part.”\n\nThe spokesperson said that Rowlatt’s “original online story is still available on the BBC website as is the radio version of the documentary”.\n\nAccording to sources in the ministry, at least four filming applications by BBC and its Natural History Unit (NHU) have been rejected by the ministry since March.\n\nAired in February, the documentary by Rowlatt explored what it called the “dark secrets” of Kaziranga and asked if the war on poaching has gone too far. It claimed that forest guards were given powers “to shoot and kill”.\n\nThe result, claimed the film, was that more people were killed by forest guards than rhinos by poachers: 23 people lost their lives compared to just 17 rhinos last year. In a BBC article introducing the film, Rowlatt also claimed that only two intruders were prosecuted while 50 were shot dead since 2014.\n\nThe film questioned the Kaziranga authority’s justification that the forest guards had engaged with heavily armed poachers. “Just one park guard has been killed by poachers in the past 20 years compared with 106 people shot dead by guards over the same period,” it claimed.\n\nIn July 2010, the Assam government offered immunity to Kaziranga forest staff under section 197(2) of the CrPC, 1973: “Only if it is held by an Executive Magistrate through an enquiry that use of firearms have been unnecessary, unwarranted and excessive and such report has been examined and accepted by the Government, then alone any proceeding including institution of a criminal case of any nature or affecting an arrest can be initiated by police.”\n\nIn the 11 years before this notification, between 2000 and 2010, 17 poachers were shot dead inside Kaziranga while 68 rhinos were killed. Since the notification, between 2011 and 2016, the number of poachers killed jumped to 59 and the number of rhinos poached to 103.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'Well, BBC has a reputation of being an ass when it comes to India so.....'
"I thought the BBC report made India look good !\n\nSure, this is because we kill poachers, but they don't deserve anything better ! We have more dispensable humans than rhinos !"
"Irrespective of whether the Indian Government is wrong; BBC needs to stay the fuck away from India after what Britain's done in India and how the British government has made ZERO efforts to acknowledge it's wrongs in the last 150+ years."
"Sad situation that even after so many years of independence, I still can't trust my countrymen and would rather believe that foreign agency's version of the truth."
'and the other one\n\n>There are many British who would die to defend the BBC.\nBut the reality, for anyone with open eyes to see, is that the BBC is an ignorant, intolerant, hateful organisation as a result of left-wing factions taking over the corporation.\nEver see a travel show by the BBC? It\'s always an ethnic "minority" (I use that in a loose sense because blacks and Asians are no minorities in the UK these days) travelling to a country like Japan and showing absolutely no respect for the cultures or traditions for the host nation.\nI cringe whenever the BBC do a foreign culture show. More like raging selfish bull in a China (literally) shop.\nSo it\'s no wonder the BBC is finding itself banned internationally from all kinds of places. Because people outside Britain can see what the BBC has become.'

'Still trying to find what is illegal, as per Indian law, in what the BBC did. '
"I don't know about anti-India but they do love to perpetuate stereotypes about everyone - Africans dirt poor, Indians chaotic and weird, American trigger happy war mongering lunatics etc - isolated incidents that conform to these stereotypes somehow make the fornt page every time, but relevant news on politics, economy etc outside the UK barely do. "
'> They are quite anti India, too.\n\nDid you even watch the documentary?'
"BBC won't challenge in court and govt will withdraw ban after 6 months."
"Is it their fault the country is in bad state? Do you want them to show lies in their documentary? Sorry to break it to you, BBC doesn't follow Bollywood standards."
'They have always been biased against India'
"That's actually true. A lot of those killed aren't even poachers. "
"We don't have infinite resources to engage in media wars. Besides it just confuses the issue."
"Don't you remember when news sites last year started using anti ad-blockers on their articles?  \n\nThis was done to counter that. "
'> In the 11 years before this notification, between 2000 and 2010, 17 poachers were shot dead inside Kaziranga while 68 rhinos were killed. Since the notification, between 2011 and 2016, the number of poachers killed jumped to 59 and the number of rhinos poached to 103.'

How dare you allow a clearly Paki supporting woman who fucks countries and Brexits to visit India. I cried all night fearing for Mudikakas life, I truly thought he forgot about our fight for independence from the dangerous british monarchy. In the end we committed grave injustice to Bharat Mata by inviting her.'
'Citation? Take a look at their news website.  \n  \nTerrorist attacks on India are never by terrorists. They are by gunmen. Or attackers.  \n  \n Anywhere else, including Pakistan? Terrorists.  \n  \nAlso, you seriously need to grow up and get rid of that small lulli syndrome.\n  \n   '
"I don't quite agree with the ban either. Government should have issued a notice to the broadcaster along with the clarifications about the conservation efforts . The 5 year blanket ban is indeed overreaching."
"Didn't you get the circular? Only Zee News and India TV have the licence to show India in a negative light and that too, only about Muslims and non-bjp parties "
'>"irreparable damage done to India’s reputation"\n\nLOL. This is one of the reasons this country will never improve. '
"Which is still legal.\n\n\n*That* is the point. Not whether it actually is propaganda or isn't."
"Did you forget this?  \n  \n> He replied that he didn't write that stuff, it was added back in BBC HQ. He also said that their reporting was heavily edited by BBC HQ,"
"The gold standard my ass. I'm no bhakt, and this government can go fuck itself hard. But if you don't see the inherent bias in BBC reporting in India, Palestine, China, Britain's colonial past, then you really should stop drinking the Kool-aid.\n\nThe BBC is a propaganda arm of the British government. It is very good at what it does, which is why not many people see it as a propaganda arm. But many scholars have explored their biases. Google that shit. "
"Terrorists attacks in Paris too weren't called terrorists but gunmen. They have a policy about it and stick to it. \n\nThis shit is getting nauseating now. "
"> Terrorist attacks on India are never by terrorists. They are by gunmen. Or attackers\n\n\nThat's a weak argument. Trying to make a mountain out of molehill.\n\n\nIf you need examples of baseless journalism look no far than India's news channels."
"Indians just don't know how Poor and Backward India really is [fish in a small pond], the way we treat we Women \n\nand many others. guh.\n\nUntil dramatic change in Wealth creation which would be used to Educated, eradicate Malnutrition, modernize Culture/Tradition. make Religion insignificant.\n\nthese things will not happen until income levels rise, a TV set in their home (yes, TV set changes lot of 1000 year old bad social behaviours). \n\nVillages need to empowered and modernized make them into Town/Cities with police maintaining rule of law, Healthcare, Shops, decent Housing etc., all these facilities are necessities for Modernization.\n\nEdit: my TV argument might seem silly but it's truth, TV in poorest peoples home will change them somewhat from where they are.\n\nFor us it's regressive but i'm talking bout poorest 20-30% bottom. TV is a step upwards. from NEWS and they see lifestyles of other people on TV which would be good.\n\nsample evidence TV is good in poorest people http://www.economist.com/news/international/21714981-how-one-worlds-great-social-problems-solving-itself-war-baby-girls-winds\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_states_ranking_by_television_ownership but remember many of them are small TV's with cable availbale only in last few years."

'Apparently these guys went to talk but bansali didnt show up and sent his bouncers out who fired a shot in air.. then this shit started '
'This is not just about Freedom of Expression, but also about the deep rooted patriarchy. How dare you talk about OUR women like that?!\nAlso, this talk about "distorting history" is all BS. One, there is no objective history about this. It\'s folklore. And by some accounts, Jayasi\'s Padmavathi was itself not a true account. In worst case scenario, they are distorting a fictionalised account. Two, even if it is true, there is no excuse for hooliganism. If they are such dedicated Rajputs, they should be willing to spend some time in jail for this "cause".'

'Probably that is why we need no Trump. Our citizens are enough'
"Beating someone up isn't called 'having an opinion'. You think Nirbhaya rapists only had an 'opinion' about how girls should be treated? \n\nThey have every right to feel offended. And Bhansali has every right to offend. What people don't have is the right to assault someone. Have a problem? Take it to court. "
">Hence, the cartoon is literally asking me to shut up because \n\nIt isn't though. Speak. And speak your mind. The cartoon is not about speaking, it's about physical assault on the film director. When you think it's okay to beat people into submission to get your way, you probably aren't very different than the barbarian you claim to hate. "
'> The liberal mental gymnastics is mind boggling.\n\nNice conclusion. Looks like whatever-brand-of-politics-you-subscribe-to\'s leaps of "logic" are flawless. Pointing out hypocrisy is tantamount to being told to shut up? If you don\'t agree, speak up, no one is stopping you. But if your argument is based on "honoring" icons and "moral codes" then don\'t be shocked and offended if someone points out hypocritical or contradictory behavior. Also, if an "argument" involves throwing furniture and punches, then it\'s not really an argument.'

"The lifestyles in kapil sharma and saas bahu are a 100 times more progressive than what they are suffering.\n\nIndia's poorest are absurdly poor."
'You do realize that these TV shows are more progressive than some parts of our country? Hell, there are villages in our country, where women are not allowed to step out of their homes.'
"I'm talking about 20-30% Bottom poorest people [ these people are Poorest in the world not just India], it's a step upwards."
"Because 14 year olds, teens, young adults don't watch saas bahu crap. They watch various  including MTV etc(roadies, love hotel or whatever crap - it is as big a travesty as saas bahu). If saas bahu does auditions and roadies does auditions, look at people who turn up. Moreover, TV brings choice where there was none before.  "
'Actually, this TV set suggestion [is to restrict population](http://conservationmagazine.org/2013/09/tv-as-birth-control/). The parent commentator has a weird obsession with over population.'

"again this is funny.

'>you never get results from court\n\nThen maybe, just maybe, we should fix this problem first.'

'Drunk me read it as Sikhism and left me very confused.'
'Honking scares the road cows.'
'I honk at almost every intersection to let stupid drivers know to watch out for me. I guess i should just let them hit me.'
'You get fined for that in Chandigarh. Drunk driving gets your vehicle impounded. Traffic police is very strict. '
'Honking is actually recommended on blind and narrow turns, which is often the case with mountain roads.'
"Most sharp turns in India don't have convex mirror especially in ghat regions and multistory parking lots with single lanes. \n\nThere is no way to know if a car is coming from opposite side other than honk because even if you are driving at 10km/hr, by the time you notice the other car, collision is inevitable."
"Nope it's totally safe. Driving in the wrong Lane in the other hand isn't safe"
'With the amount of traffic we have.. \nI don\'t think bangaloreans have that much patience.\n\nAnd it\'s "Bengaluru" now \nP. S.  I hate the new name'

'Can they stop bribery while issuing license too ?\n\nI got my DL before I learned to drive !!'
'If it is an intersection without a traffic light, you slow down or stop long enogh to make sure no idiot in tearing hurry is going to cut you into two. With your attitude what we have is two idiots letting each other know they plan to go through the intersection come what may, and proceeding to create a mess for others to clean up.\n\nIf it is an intersection with lights, you simply obey the lights.'
'Err, Bombay awful with the high beams, as is Pune, and the rest of Maharashtra.'
"That's not because of honking essentially. It's mostly overspeeding and not staying in your lane. Honking is a necessity in the country because of poorly engineered roads, lack of traffic signs(can't believe honking in itself is used as a traffic sign!) and a lack of awareness about road safety among the people."
'No one I know paid a bribe to get a DL. '
"If you're cutting into the mainroad, its your responsibility to watch out for the on coming traffic, not the other way around, if I was to slow down at every cut, the cars behind me might come to a sudden halt and cause an accident.\n\nI guess you wouldn't know what the rules are because you're probably not old enough to drive."
'old jaipur part is filthy as fuck '
'This is nonsense. Moved to Bombay last year, every lane ka chaurasta is an orgy of autos, cars and buses with the odd group of pedestrians adding to the chaos while people nick their rear views and stop all the traffic while they start measuring their dicks on the road'
"Then you heard wrong. People use high beam because:\n\na) It's the default fucking setting in most cars; and\n\nb) The street lights are not working/non-existent."
"No no, use it. It's the correct name."
"You got me clicking 'this' until I realised there is no hyperlink on it :("

"Delhi is a rich state compared to other states. It is able to spend much more per capita on education than others. Even then people are flocking to private schools and are willing to pay more.\n\nThe reason is simple, there are not enough **good** schools.

If you distort the free market then things will get disastrous in education. \n\nIn poorer states the situation is worse.

Every country learns to fucking get over it, except poor little India.\n\nAnother thing - India is the ONLY country where we have a religious vegetarianism that\'s extremely common, most of all in the upper caste communities. Muslims *only* don\'t eat pork, they eat literally everything else. But somehow muslim food related stupidity is somehow equivalent.\n\nEgg bans and morons looking for veg ice cream on fasting days really takes the cake. Oh and cake has to be eggless as well.

"The first comment on that article is cancerous. \n\n>This is the Muslim mindset in a nutshell; they refuse to assimilate or even adapt to the majority culture and in fact go the extra mile to stick a finger into the eye of the dominant culture. \n\nGuy has probably heard a lot of European right wing complaints about how 'Muslims don't assimilate' and is now trying to import it into India without realizing the fact that those complaints are directed at **immigrants**. \n\nMuslims in India aren't immigrants, they're as native as anybody else. They do not have to be forced to assimilate to the dominant culture(whichever imaginary culture that is, in India). I hope these hindutvadis will eventually come to realize that Islam is also a part of India.\n\n\n"

But let\'s break down the current scenario:\n\n* Group A eats (or in many cases is only *suspected* of eating) beef, which hurts the sentiments of Group B\n* Group B lynches/eats Group A\n\nThose groups don\'t necessarily coincide with "non-Hindu" and "Hindu".\n\nNow it isn\'t exactly difficult to figure out which group is being more insensitive and which group needs to tone it down a bit and be tolerant. \n\nBesides, it\'s not even certain that beef is not allowed under Hinduism. There are several Hindus who\'ve been eating it for ages. But even if I concede that killing cows isn\'t allowed, none of the cow vigilantes have yet offered a shred of evidence that killing *humans* is allowed as a response to the act of (being suspected of) eating beef. \n\nGiven all that, unless somebody is shoving beef down the throats of the cow vigilantes or parading dead cow carcasses in front of them, their concerns are pure albeit dangerous nonsense.

He is an autocrat that wants to wipe out the opposition, strangle media and free speech and become the sole ruler and dictator.\n\nAll of this reminds me of Indira Gandhi and the Bhindranwale debacle. Modi is showing all the autocratic symptoms. And it is not just Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan and UP yesterday, there is continuous rioting in Kerala for a month where CPM and RSS have been killing each others' workers and have even used bombs in the past, West Bengal is in turmoil and Kashmir, which has been relatively peaceful for a while has devolved into anarchy after Modi+PDP coalition.\n\nPlus the standoff with China - the government has not told us half the stuff going on.\n\nFrankly, I wouldn't be surprised if he declared a second dark period of Emergency in India. Too many of his steps echo Indira Gandhi's. The only difference is before she lost it, she freed Bangladesh, defeated Pakistan, did Smiling Buddha, etc. Modi, on the other hand, did DeMo, took panga with China, Unsettled Kashmir, and now this.

"He is the Prime Minister of not\nthe BJP but of India," said the Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n\nThe court was responding to Additional Solicitor General Satya Pal Jain, who\nis representing the centre, saying that yesterday\'s violence was a matter of\nthe state. "Is Haryana not a part of India? Why are Punjab and Haryana treated\nlike step children?" the court questioned.\n\nEarlier, the\n\nML Khattar government in Haryana\n\nconfronted sharp words as the court said: "You let a city like Panchkula burn\nfor political motives."\n\nAfter Ram Rahim\'s conviction, thousands of his supporters massed near a court\nin Panchkula went berserk, burning cars, damaging property and targeting\nresidents. The violence spread to other towns in Haryana and parts of Punjab.\n\nHaryana government has ordered a search of all centres belonging to the Dera\nSacha Sauda\n\n"You let the situation escalate. You surrendered to the situation," said\ncourt, admonishing the state government over a Panchkula police officer being\nsacked this morning. "You are trying to crucify a small DCP of Panchkula what\nabout those political masters who have been giving wrong directions?" the\njudges said to the Haryana government.\n\nNearly three hours of arson and vandalism left Panchkula, always seen as a\npeaceful second option to adjoining Chandigarh, badly scarred.\n\nThe Haryana government has been criticised for allowing at least 1.5 lakh\nfollowers of\n\nDera Sacha Sauda\n\n, the sect headed by Ram Rahim, to gather at Panchkula for the verdict,\ndespite a ban on large gatherings.\n\nThe court also asked how many cars were allowed into Panchkula yesterday\nafternoon when Ram Rahim arrived from Sirsa - the Dera headquarters - in a\nlarge convoy for the court verdict.\n\nChief Minister\n\nML Khattar had acknowledged yesterday that there were lapses\n\n. The "lapses have been identified and we are taking appropriate steps," he\nsaid last night, adding: "This should not have happened."\n\nBut in another statement, he also appeared to shield Ram Rahim\'s followers as\nhe said criminals had infiltrated the crowd of Dera Sacha Sauda devotees.\n\nThe comments were not missed by the court, which said: "Your Chief Minister\nsaid miscreants got mixed up with Dera people, giving the impression that they\ndidn\'t do anything, you\'re still supporting them, you are the ones who made\nthis happen."\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'Saw some Panchkula residents expressing a lot of anger towards him on the news today. You think his reelection may be a bit shaky after this as well as the Jat agitation? '
"Well, that is not what I meant. Did you know China had actually refused to give data predicting flash floods since March? The Government hid this from us. Modu has been very vociferous about Balochistan (which is the main part of China's CPEC) and he boycotted the OBOR summit which has made the west suspicious of OBOR after they started looking into it after the boycott. These were a couple of the few things that angered China.\n\nNow India needs to protest CPEC and OBOR but Modi's handling of the matter was very poor. His handling of China as a whole is - well I am 50-50 on it. So, I consider him partially responsible for the idiocy in his diplomacy. You could exempt him from this if you want."

They just spread propaganda and spend 5 years filling their pockets, quashing opposition, playing a game of thrones with the public and auctioning cabinet seats. They just spread propaganda and the public believes that they are doing so much. GST conceive or pass hone mein kareeb 25 saal lag gaye aur tab bhi aisa usless plab nikala with such bad implementation.\n\nIt\'s not just BJP, all parties are like this, today.

"I understand the point you're trying to make but your arguments are flawed.\n\nThe central govt is answerable for it's actions and it is a direct stakeholder in the current riots. After all the centre provided troops as well. So PM is answerable for how the situation got out of hand. And the entire blame cannot be pushed onto the state government.\n\nBut blaming the centre entirely (actually just one person) for the mistakes of the state government also seem unreasonable. \n\n> So when the state politicians fail to take steps they knew they should have taken when  the outcome here wasn't unforeseeable, is it a stretch to ask their masters for aid or explanation? \n\nMasters? I'm sorry but despite what you may believe, there is no master apprentice relationship between them. A political move is just that. A move to gain political power. If supporting an incompetent minister gets you power then who wouldn't use it? It is morally wrong and irresponsible but it is legal. If you have a problem with it then vote for a representative that will change this. Or file an FIR\n\n> And what exactly is he responsible for, when everything bad that ever happens is someone else's fault?\n\nHe is responsible for the duties that he has to perform. They are mentioned in the constitution. Not every stupid shit done by his party is his direct responsibility. It baffles me how just one person is considered responsible for the actions of perhaps thousands of members of their organisation."

'I never said that we should not have a strong stance against China or bow down to them. I merely said that there is a difference between being stern and resolute vs clanging louder than your capacity. I am not against a firm and strong action against China. I am against crazy antics with no real plan to handle if we get attacked in real which is what Nehru did. He supported China\'s accession of Tibet, gave shelter to Dalai Lama and Tibetans and did not even prepare for a war and I will never forgive him for that, for his stupidity, impotence, syphilitic infatuation, and prostration to our number one enemy. My problem is that Modi is an incendiary propaganda with no plan of action seemingly on a similar path.\n\nVajpayee took panga with US with nuclear blasts. First, despite tremendous pressure from US, he refused to sign CTBT. Then he carried out the tests. He never said a word about it and just did it with US drones flying 24X7 over India. At the time even CIA was freaked out at their "biggest failure in history". Everyone was scared but Vajpayeee had prepared for all contingencies far in advance. His statements were like - "we have calculated everything. US trade forms only 10% of India\'s trade and trade itself is a very small portion of India\'s economy. Russia, UK, and France are not levying sanctions and we have enough money to ride US sanctions" (paraphrased) and little as I was, I knew the matter was in good hands and I was all "go for it". That\'s what sensible leaders do. Modi seems to be riling things up at home and abroad, is hiding information from us that should be known to the public and seems to not have a coherent plan for dealing with an actual war, God forbid it occurs.\n\nDon\'t jump your guns and go to China worship and 1962 when someone says one needs to be cautious in dealing with China. China uses stealth, propaganda, bullying, and treachery as equally important means of warfare as weapons. In being cautious with China, it is not weakness a person is asking for, just more sense, focus and planning along with bold action and less fumbling around, surgical strike propaganda and bad diplomacy.\n\nRegarding Balochistan, that is the heart of China\'s CPEC. I was just mentioning the reasons for China\'s anger. Modi shouted it a number of times but hasn\'t done anything. I myself have been telling people that we should be staging coups in Balochistan, internationally raising the matter of Tibet and Xin-Jiang "human rights violations" and showing support for HongKong. But that\'s what you do - you stay shut and just talk about it to the leaders of the world, not shout it from ramparts and do nothing at all. When Indira Gandhi amputated Pakistan from Bangladesh, she didn\'t sing about it 2 years in advance. She quietly went to Russia, confirmed their support and did it overnight. That\'s always how coups and freedom operations are done. A sensible leader would have started a coup without trumpeting about it. Trumpeting means it was only propaganda to show Indian people that he is doing something, a propaganda to falsely inflate his 56 inch ka seena while having no actual plan regarding it.\n\n With China, I am not saying that we should back down - heaven knows we can not afford to and we should not. However, while China issues about 10 statements over the issue daily. India has issued only a handful. Now, I don\'t want warmongering rhetoric from our side but I want India to release the same statement debunking China\'s claim and making Inda\'s stand clear whenever China spews its nonsense. I wanted more back channels to be opened to keep communication and diplomacy open with China, increased Naval presence in the Indian Ocean and more vigilance along the Indo-Tibet and Indo-Pak Border, to stay focused, be clever and astute. Eg. To have look out people from the military all along the border dressed as shepherds etc while the military is stationed a few km behind the border. So that the moment they see Chinese activity, they can be brought to the scene within minutes, not 2 days after Chinese army infiltrates a field, evacuates the village and the army is informed by the shepherd of the region and then the Indian army has a stone fight to try and displace the Chinese from their own territory. And this is not a retrospect statement. I have been saying this since two days after the stand-off started. I expected him to amp up cyber operations (if we have any, if not they should have been started a decade ago at least) and special forces both for offense and defense, to amp up resource management and the trade war should have started earlier (when China refused to supply flash flood data) with better planning. CIA actually seems to have Adhar data, China has contracts for energy grids which give access to the entire Digital India which needed to be terminated long ago. The whole world  (except EU) is trying to rid their market of Chinese products, we should have started long ago and I expected Modi to so from the moment he took office. I have seen no evidence of any of that. I would have liked to see a better coalition with Japan, S. Korea and Australia, however, there are no signs of a solid coalition except a support statement from Japan. Granted we cannot and should not know about cyber and special forces, but there are no other indications either. Hell, we don\'t even have a defence minister! Jaitley, the Finance Minister and the Minister of Corporate Affairs, is managing Defence. Sushma Swaraj was ill for a long time and we didn\'t have a Foreign Minister or a defence minister for a bit. Thankfully, she recovered. At least a Foreign Miniter is there. That is what I mean by poor handling of the situation by Modi.  First, try to understand what I am saying before you try to rip my head off for being on the same basic side as you with some disagreements.'

"This was just to say that there is arrogance. I have felt that from the time I was a student having travelled to other parts of India for cultural events. The condescension and patronisation was hugely apparent and the things these guys would say in Hindi in the notion that we would not understand it was horrible. The only satisfaction I got was watching their faces melt when I spoke back in Hindi. I usually never saw it as discrimination, but as something kids do. But to see the actual intensity of the divide fucked me up after joining the work force. \n\nThere was this dude from Mumbai who was a site in charge for a contracting firm, working in Bangalore back in the early to mid 2000's who picked a fight with the electrical guys who were from the south. I had to mediate and he knows I am from the south too. He hurled abuses at them and used the word Madrasi. As a young, idealistic man, that was the first of many blows to my idea of India. Little by little, incidents like this cemented in my mind, the reality of the north-south divide. This is the case with most of us from the South having to navigate the idea of patriotism, of a united nation, of equality, of courtesy and civility. Our languages are made fun of, our culture is made fun of, our skin tone, our English, for fucks sake, while every part of India have distinctive accents, ours is picked on most. Then we have all the Ads that depict our states and our culture being outrageously bigoted and still being played all over town. How much of this would be tolerated by the rest of India? \n\nThis is not as bad as the people from NE have to endure all over India. Why the fuck are we like this? How fucking difficult is it to respect others? Isn't respect supposed to be enshrined in our blood? In our religion as all these fucking bastards like to point out, while killing each other in the name of religion? We are always proud of our 'unity in diversity', but now that diversity is what is under attack. What else do we want to be divided on? We already have states, borders, rivers, water, language, skin colour, politics, religion, food, clothing, culture, region... what more can we add to this? \n\nAnd as much as I hate to mention this, even our national anthem only mentions the south in passing and the NE does not even get a mention and yet we sing it with pride and to hear the anthem at a sporting event that we win brings tears into our eyes. And even after all this, the fucking bastards in government want us to prove our patriotism. Well, cut out our bleeding hearts ya shit eating fucks, who wouldn't know unity and patriotism if it was staring them in the face. \n\n"

Himself had a plate in skull due to accident. \n\ngod bless him. My dad makes a point to meet him once a year at least.'
"Quite frankly, despite all the hate and self loathing we have here, have traveled across India and been in near desperate times (for various reasons) and every time there was somebody or many who helped. \n \nLike the Uttrakand avalanches / floods, waa stranded near Roopkund. No hotel, no warm place to stay, nothing. A very poor(1bedroom tiny house) saw me at the bus stand and asked if I needed help, and took me in. No questions asked. Offered to pay them for 2 days boarding and lodging, the guy even took the money (offered quite a bit, some 6k), but the wife returned it as she said taking money from a brother is not right. I broke down at that point. That was a lot of money for them and to turn it down was insane. \n\nNot just this, so many instances. Was stuck in a traffic jam reroute to BIAL, left my check in luggage in the cab (leap of faith), flagged a bike guy riding on a pavement (sorry sorry) and he said it was out of the way, but dropped me at the airport, refused to take money, while the cab guy honestly dropped off the luggage at my place...No sweat. Even life threatening things, people have helped and we have helped people. An uncle of mine was in Shivaji Nagar on work during the 2007 riots, taken in by a Muslim business contact of his, no questions asked. He left after a day, when it was safe. \n\nAt our very core, we are a very hospitable people, the sad thing though is that in usual times we can be nasty and hostile, but come a moment of crisis and it's like some flood of humanity comes out in us.

Many people tried to reach out to anyone near that area who had 4 wheeler.

"You know they do exactly the same whenever the Dalai Lama goes somewhere, they did the same with Mongolia recently, plus it was on a disputed territory, but that doesn't mean they care about India, they don't need to appease anyone about CPEC, they just do what they planned to do"

'I\'m in the US and when we had our orientation for international students, in between speakers, they played this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDYFqQZEdRA\n\nThis was orientation for international kids. There were Arabs, Europeans, Africans but they showed us this video among other things to help teach us how to behave in the US. Fyi, This orientation was coupled with things like personal space, how to talk to your professors, culture shock, etc. This is what the world will slowly think of us as - lascivious, barbaric men who can\'t keep it in our pants. \n\nThis is going to hit the front page, guys. And the reddit "What the fuck, India?" shit is going to start. I hate having to defend ourselves as well as want to acknowledge this shit at the same time. \n\nHonestly, I think that ad campaign should be shown at the beginning of all movies and probably time and time again on TV. It is embarrassing and effective. As a matter of fact, lets make some more that discuss it with more focus on people like this having sisters who are witnessing the same shit they dole out to other women.'
'I don\'t know who these animals are or why they behaved the way they behaved. This is fucking indefensible.   \n  \nIndia has major problems with sexual repression, objectification of women and ignorance about women in general. The cherry on top of all this is the fact that there is a tremendous lack of respect for people, especially those perceived to be "below" us in the social ladder. This manifests itself in day to day urban life.  \n  \nSome parts of India also have rigid social hierarchies that at the very base level dictate that women are expected to be subservient to men, and any behavior deviating from this is bad and women deserve whatever follows. \n  \nI read a few comments on Facebook news articles posted by news organizations, and some comments placed the blame on the women for having the gall to be drunk, or be poorly dressed. There were also a couple of "what about false cases filed by women against men" type nonsensical comments.  \n  \nWhat do you do then? I\'m not sure how anyone would fix this major social problem, at all.  \n  \nI guess a good place to start would be by fixing the police system and the judiciary, so that people who engage in BS like this atleast get more than a rap on the knuckle (or worse).   \n  \n'

"I am an Indian guy and I confess that I stare some times. I also get stared at a lot of times. Care to explain what is wrong with staring ? \n\nIf this video was played in your orientation, I think it only counts as enforcing a racial prejudice and not anything else. If you had some self-esteem you should should have stood up to your white masters than bitching about your country on reddit.\n\nAlso, I stay in Bangalore and I was there at both MG Road and Brigade road with friends during nye(including female ones). There was no molestation around me. The reported incidents are isolated events and not mass molestation.  \n\nAccording to me the reason that these events happen is because of coverage like this. You are the real reason why things like these happen and not the 'lascivious, barbaric' men like me."
'>The cherry on top of all this is the fact that there is a tremendous lack of respect for people\n\nI think this is the most important aspect from which the problems of racism and sexism stem from. Everyone here judges those that are poorer, of lower caste, of darker skin, of different ethnicity, of different sexual orientation etc. \n\nChange is taking place but far too slowly and mostly in a few progressive suburbs in large cities. There needs to be widespread cultural overhaul and immediately. The process will take decades and a few generations which means it must be started now. Look at Japan. They managed to hold on to their culture while taking Western progressive ideals. Same must be done with India.'

'there has been much propaganda surrounding this event. It happened but not even close to this extent. Its not fair to judge an entire race because of some shitty news source'
"I am going to preface this by saying this isn't a judgement or an attack on you, I am trying to breakdown what I have seen happen in my own friend circle and also some reports I have read of similar things happening abroad. \n\nSome men have a habit of staring at a women and consider that they are giving a compliment by the staring. The similar mindset is there about catcalling too. The mindset is there from a place that men would love if some girl stares at them or catcalls them. The issue here is men don't fear a stranger girl but women do. When women see a guy staring at them they don't know the intentions of the guys staring at them? They don't know if the guy is going to follow them home; these fears comes from experience. A guy creeping on girls is something most girls face with at some point in their life.  A stare which is a compliment for guys comes off as threatening for women. Also a lot of times the staring is not limited to the face no women likes to be objectified for her private parts. I would suggest you listening to this podcast for the first 19 mins to get an idea from a women's perspective. https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/603/once-more-with-feeling\n\nRegarding the newspaper I am not sure how reporting on a event leads to more events like that happening. India has a serious issue with gender sensitivity. Hiding these things under the rug has been India's go to thing for the past many years. \n\nThe extent of the mass molestation is debatable sure but I feel it would be unfair to any victim if we downplay the seriousness of the situation. \n \n"

'187 chapters! Think about students who had to memorize it as a part of oral tradition. '
'Early Vedic rituals involved a lot of animal sacrifices including Cows, Bulls and Horses also they were killed for food. These animal were eaten after sacrifices too. It was only after Buddhism became popular in India and also to counter the dwindling cattle population that Hinduism banned animal sacrifices importantly Cow killing. \n\nAlso Susruta lived around 5th-6th century BC so that was the time when meat eating and animal sacrifices were at their peak. '
'Jo buddhism na hota, na brahmins ki ego hurt hoti, na beef ban hota.'
"All consumption of animal flesh should be illegal. With the amount of pollution in India it's completely irresponsible to argue that flesh consumption for any reason is justifiable. Animal agriculture accounts for more greenhouse gases than all forms of transportation **combined**. \n\nPeople are up in arms about the pollution from crackers on Diwali but won't take into account their personal responsibilities contributing to the problem on a daily basis. "
"I'm not clear on why this matters. I mean if you don't want to eat beef then what's the problem?"
"I'm calling bullshit on the 3-4000 years old thing"
'Only the upper caste believe in cow protection. Lower castes were not allowed to learn sanskrit and read vedas. So they are not obligated to to follow what is written in a book they are not allowed to read or learn.'
'Wrong info. The interpretation is wrong.'
"Cow were considered sacred because of their giving nature even in Vedic times (there's plenty of evidence like seals, texts), but this does not mean other cattle was not eaten. \n\nHindu followers shouldn't just limit themselves to Vedas or Vedic times, there's Upanishads, Puranas, Agamas, Nigamas, Vachanas etc some of which forbid killing of cows and some even eating. The list is literally endless and ultimately it's upto you. \n\n"
'Here are few views of MK Gandhi on Cow protection (bit extreme IMO)\n\n"The central fact of Hinduism is cow protection." \n"Cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the world. And Hinduism will live so ling as there are Hindus to protect the cow……" \n"Mother cow is in many ways better than the mother who gave us birth. Our mother gives us milk for a couple of years and then expects us to serve her when we grow up. Mother cow expects from us nothing but grass and grain. Our mother often falls ill and expects service from us. Mother cow rarely falls ill."\nBy thorough reform of the PINJRAPOLES [institutions for aged cows] of India, which are today, as a rule, managed ignorantly and without any plan by men who do not know their work.\n\nWhen these primary things are done, it will be found that the Muslims will, of their own accord, recognize the necessity, if only for the sake of their Hindus brethren, of not slaughtering cattle for beef or otherwise.\n\n'
"> Want to protect something? Make it holy, sacred. \n\nThat didn't work so well for Ganga.\n\n> the couple is forced to stay together cause muh married sacred asf\n\nI feel that has more to do with how independent the women are in our society and how difficult a life they will have post divorce, which makes it more practical for them to suffer terrible marriages."
">Forced to stay together\n\n\nOnly when the wife is dependent on her husband.\n\n\nWomen with careers don't put up with that sort of nonsense, they can afford not to."
"i have this nagging question, and you mentioned something that made me ask you to see if you could answer : marriage is saath janam ka rishta, right? so, how does one know which number we are currently at?\n\ndo you know about 'maitri patra'?"
'An acharya who is quite close to our family says that no beef references were originally there in any ayurvedic texts, these were added many centuries later by yavana (greeks) and mlechchas (barbarians who came from the west).'
'Especially the chapters on different protocols. If you forget one shloka, you might end up killing the patient.'
'I think the salient point here is that as a hindu you can choose to eat beef or not but there is nothing in the religion that restricts you from doing so.'

"You can't fight iron made weapons with bronze or copper made swords. You need to use religious mumbo jumbo to fight religious nutjobs.

'Mudikaka has become dhobi ka kutta, he can neither support ayurveda completely nor western medicine, na ghar ka na ghaat ka.'
'Cows are also farmed for their milk. So I guess you have stopped drinking milk a long time ago?'

"There were dravidians and aryans, but they're no more. Both of you are participating in a nice round of chest thumping, but the truth is that your lives are totally different from those of your supposed ancestors. Compared to our present lifestyles, both dravidians and aryans were, brace yourself, 'barbarians'. They were not flying in their ancient knowledge spaceships. They were struggling, fighting for land, as there ancestors before them did and as their descendants after them did. "

"You'd be surprised what even women with careers put up with. It's mental slavery due to being born in this kulcha."
"if you are going by early scriptures, then no of course not, actually archeological findings suggest that early vedic society used to consume meats of horse, buffalo, ox and smaller mammals and birds along with fresh water fish and crustaceans. And these things reflect in the texts of the same period as well.\n\nBut the modern scriptures that are just a few centuries old do forbid consumption of certain kinds of meat and that includes cow meat as item number 1. Now it could be argued that the rise to prominence of certain factions in hinduism lead to these societal modifications.. but i'm not here to make my own argument but rather leave you with evidence to decide for yourself.\n\nIn my personal opinion, consumption of beef should be a matter of personal preference rather than controlled by legislation."
">Again, sources?\n\nAnyone who has even a 1% understanding of Ayurvedic terms will know about Sattvik and Tamsic bhojan.\n\nDon't act smart about things you know nothing about."
"How did you get that from my sentence? Everytime anything about Ayurveda is posted, people lose their shit saying how useless/ dangerous it is. Isn't it hypocritical to do that and now legitimise it with this kind of stuff. I mean isn't it cherry picking"
'> It\'s perhaps the only thing about ancient Indians that was based on some measure of observation and results.\n\nYes it was, but the methodologies employed were less than optimal by the modern day standards, and there were other issues: If the normal life expectancy is 30 years, someone eating arsenic for a treatment at 28 isn\'t going to show you a measurable change. Thats how heavy metals and other dangerous substances remain part of the ayurvedic medicine. The drug preparation process itself leaves a lot to the preparer\'s imagination, so even when starting with same materials, the preparers learning from different schools will generate drugs of different potency. As for starting with same materials, there\'s a problem there, too. Completely different plant species (as defined by modern classification techniques) are assigned the same "traditional"\' name in different parts of India, and thus the supposedly same medicine with supposedly same ingredients is really a different pharmacological entity in the different parts of the country. \n\nAyurveda, with its veneer of "effective", "proven" medicine is worse than bush medicine, that even the practitioner knows is worthless, because your local ayuvedic "doctor" has a degree to show you, and convinces him/herself that they actually know what they are doing. \n\nI do think that we can get a lot of useful drugs from ayurveda after proper testing, and there\'s a lot to be learned about mode of actions of complex medicines rather than simple preparations with single active ingredient, but as things stand, only the uninformed with subject themselves to unproven, often dangerous, treatments.'

"Well you need to remember that we're looking at the literate section of India that can actually read whatsapp forwards in english. That immediately restricts you to at least 40-50% of the population or less. \n\nOfficial literacy stats peg Indian literacy at around 74%, but that figure is based on being able to sign. Most of India's labor class and urban slum dwellers can't read or write but they classify as 'literate' because they can just about sign their name.\n\nSo that's the thing, in India you are already ignoring the bottom 50% of the country which is effectively illiterate. On top of that you're considering people who have a smart phone and can read english. So let's say it's the top 25%.\n\nFor the top 25% of the population to be gullible idiots is a lot worse than the bottom 25% of America to buy into moronic forwards. Of course the latter should be criticized too, and American hillbillies are regularly lampooned for their ignorance.\n\nI think to be fair one of the problems is that quick reading comprehension skill levels in India are abysmal. People think in their own native language (Hindi, Tamil or Bengali) so when they read something in English they often speak out every word in their head. This makes reading painfully slow, and it takes time to even understand what's being said. Of course this is indicative of a failure in India's education system.\n\n>convenient internet search\n\nYeah - it's sad that with all the information in the world at your fingertips people are so intellectually lazy. I guess one of the problems is that the only access people have to the internet is FB and whatsapp, and they are too lazy to bother with anything else. It's so easy to open a browser app or google's search and type whatever you are looking for."

">ITT: people who are clueless about how criminal proceedings work. \n\nThe courts are not divine authority that will just pass judgement based on their hunch or gut feeling. \nThey work on the proof's and evidence presented to them. The judge cannot put a criminal behind bars if there is no evidence against him. \nThe burden of proof falls on the prosecution, and the police/authorities who arrested the criminal, not the court or the judge. \n\nSo this common resentment of the judiciary is misguided, it should be the investigation authority and the prosecutors that should be questioned for their lax. The same situation was with the hit and run case, when witnesses and evidence magically changed. \n\nTldr; Bik gyi hay ye gormint. Kuch nyi bacha gormint me. "

'And there will be almost 90% of the population of Kashmir who are tired of this daily bullshit or both Army and seperatists and just want both of them to get the fuck out.. There was a total policy failure on the part of State Government of J&K to stop alienation. There is high level of corruption as far as government funded projects are concerned and when the politicians own ass comes on fire, they start supporting jihadis to divert attention. State Government also allowed Pakistani and Saudi channels to be aired in J&K. Constant brainwashing and also a lack of economic growth in Kashmir added fuel to the fire.. Locals are acting like mercenaries in the hand of separatists and Pak Army. Making separatists more relevant in the valley would not achieve anything for India. Trust-building measures for Kashmiri people should be taken with proper monitoring of the projects. Political solution is only long term solution to any conflict.'
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Thousands At Terrorist\'s Funeral In Kashmir, Just Family For Cop He Shot** \n\n ______ \nPolice was attacked by terrorists while they were regulating traffic after a\nroad accident in Anantnag.\n\n**Srinagar: **\n\nTwo funerals in South Kashmir today - of a terrorist and a policeman he killed\n- encapsulate the Kashmir story. Azhar Mehmood - the policeman who showed\nexemplary courage and sacrificed his life to repulse a terror attack - was\nmourned by his family and colleagues. Barely 10 km away, thousands\nparticipated in the funeral of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Fayaz Ahmad\nAishwar.\n\nAzhar Mehmood and three civilians were killed in the attack carried out by\nFayaz and three other terrorists in Anantnag on Saturday. The policemen came\nunder attack while they were regulating traffic after a road accident. Sources\nsay the terrorists first tried to snatch away the guns from the policemen. Mr\nMehmood, who had grabbed a terrorist by the throat, died when the other\nterrorists opened fire.\n\n"He was working with police for the last eight years. He is survived by two\nchildren, one is just eight month old and his wife," said Mr Mehmood\'s\nrelative Gulzar Ahmad Sheikh. So far government has not announced any\ncompensation for the family.\n\nThousands participated in the funeral of Hizbul terrorist Fayaz Ahmad Aishwar.\n\nPolice said Fayaz Ahmad Aishwar - who was involved in the attack on the Border\nSecurity Forces camp in Udhampur in 2015 - carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh on\nhis head. But he was just one of the terrorists whose funeral had been\nattended by thousands over the last months. Last year, the killing of Hizbul\nMujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani had seen five-month long unrest in the\nKashmir Valley.\n\nSince then, South Kashmir has seen a groundswell of support for terrorists who\nhave been openly roaming the countryside. The police say more than the\nterrorists, the public support for them is a bigger problem for the security\nforces who have frequently encountered resistance from crowds while conducting\nanti-terror operations.\n\nOn Thursday, security forces carried out a huge anti-terror operation -\nmonitored from air by helicopters and unmanned vehicles - across two dozen\nvillages in Shopian. At its fag end, a sudden strike by terrorists killed one\ncivilian and injured two soldiers. Even on that day, the forces had\nencountered resistance from locals in at least four villages.\n\n\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'I simply donot understand how we all get so comfortable in a state/ media narrative and stop accepting ground realities, how we tend to become blind for all that happening in front of us and get cozy in our own fansy world, see what it got us so far, american liberal media rejected trump showed its own narrative and see what we have.\n\nSame thing is going around with kashmir, we are not ready to acknowledge that our policy on kashmir have failed miserably.\nNow instead of accepting it and working on it.\nWe are together trying to reject this by calling its all fake, all are terrorist, all are being paid by ISIS and ISI.\nThis is not only degrading to all kashmiris and their soul, and their own cognitive ability it made them to react when state is treating them guilty even before proving so.\n\nBy doing so we might be able to feed on our own ego, but we will do a great harm to kashmir and kashmir, time is to connect no to bomb kashmiris, talk to each and everyone of them not to out caste them and treat them as pakistani mules but our own misguided, and frusted Civilian and ask for solution not to offer our own narrative.\n\nIf we still not going to acknowledge this, we may have kashmir but we will loose kashmiris.

"At what point do we as Indians recognize that Kashmir (the valley only, not Jammu or Ladakh) will always be a liability that the rest of the nation no longer should shoulder? I don't want my Army or Police or BSF to lose a single person to this crappy little tract of land peopled by morons. I don't want my tax money to subsidize their traitor asses.

'Terrorist for us , revolutionary for them .\n'
"90% of the populace showing no confidence whatsoever in our democratic establishment and preferring to defect is an entire country or join Pakistan is a testimony of how we have failed Kashmir as a state. It's about time we do not label any sane-minded thinkers in our country such as Prashant Bhushan simply as an anti-national but instead have a discussion that transcends our current political landscape. That however, is in every sense a literal fantasy. \n\nWhatever the case be, I dare say that the current Indian occupation of Kashmir has failed miserably. "
'This is so sad. Just shows how the terrorists are taking advantage of a radically connected society. '
'Pandits and thakurs used to live there, Sikhs also used to live there and Buddhist also used to live there. But now only Muslims are living  there, who were breeding like pigs from last 40 years. \nLeh Ladakh, hilly terrain of Jammu these people are still living there, peacefully, what possible problem  Kashmiris can have.\n\nThen we have Pak+Islam supported separatist movt. who not only killed army, local police personnel but also local men. \n\nAsshole this land belongs to thousands of those soilder who were killed in unprovoked firing and coward terrorist attack sponsored by Pak. \n\nThey have to live under sovereignty of Hindustan. If if they want sharia, thn they can dive into Chenab or Jhelum can go from Pak to Kazak to turkey to nigeria'
'Why do they allow terrorists to have funerals? \n\nThrow them in a ditch and leave them to rot. Such individuals are sub-human.'

'Aman ki aasha which is your approach has failed for last 60 years'
'My opinion is we need drastic measures to get out of this quagmire. One approach could be: End AFSPA. Deploy the entire army rss engaged right now to block border porosity to cut terrorist supply lines. Army is meant to be a assault force or short duration intervention not long term  peace keepers\n\nGive this a decade and normalcy will prevail with public focus on police/political corruption as new boogeyman instead of army like rest of country.\n'
'you are trying to rationalize irrational people\n\nwith the old ways, people and policies we saw 2 wars, kargil and many other attacks. \n\nold policies have not worked\n\nremember they attacked forces which helped them in floods'
"I think more than reaching out, we need right propaganda. Because that is what Pakistan is doing there. Remember during J&K floods, army worked in civilian clothes in certain areas because people there wouldn't take help from Indian army, and remours were afloat how Pakistan is doing great job in PoK(which it was not, as PoK people were in trouble).\nWestern countries are waging similar propaganda war on ISIS, because ISIS has vast propaganda machinary. We also need to up our game against ISI."
"I get that you're talking from a very specific context of this incident in OP, but I find this demand for more respect for soldiers a little concerning. Veneration of soldiers is one of the indicators of state propaganda. Hypothetically, a propaganda state can get away with a lot of evil by using soldiers as scapegoats.\n\nSecondly, why the veneration only for soldiers? Agreed that they put their lives at risk, but doesn't a firefighter and a policeman also put their life at risk when serving the country? Shouldn't they be celebrated the same way?\n\nAlso, considering that the Indian army is unaccountable for a lot of shit that goes on in J&K, is it really what we want? Soldiers who are never questioned and always venerated."
"I would wait for more info to come in before reaching any conclusions from this piece. Kashmiris have a record of turning up in large numbers for funerals of _all_ people killed in the violence, be they militants or security personnel. It has got more to do with expressing solidarity with local families (that are part of closely-knit small-town communities) than any overt expression of political views. \n\n[Here's an example](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/shopian-encounter-thousands-in-kashmir-bid-tearful-farewell-to-soldier/) from when they turned up in the hundreds for the funeral of an Indian jawan."
"They don't care about Kashmiris and never cared. If you have any doubt read the other comments on this thread. We are like the British Raj to Kashmiris, no wonder they want a separate country."
"Are u stupid or something...comparing Trump with Kashmir problem. We already acknowledge it enough, now time to take some strict action . \n\nIf we go by ur analysis and suggestions, Punjab should have given to Khalistan in 80's. Assam should be independent in90's . Sri Lanka should also cede there territory to LTT. Fyi all these were at times worst thn kasmir\n\nThis is a Pakistan sponsored religion  based terrorism which mainly fuelled by radical Islamic ideas with separatist tendency.  Youth of Kashmir can be easily assimilated in main stream, if they stop holding that green flag and start participating  in nation building.\n\n\n"
"It's not Kashmir that wants out; it's the tribals. Nobody ever asks what the Kashmiri pandits want because they've been ousted by the same fanatics who want a separate state. And once you give in to such a demand you lose any foreground you have against any such future demands."
'urban Naxalites especially on Reddit and Twitter will cry'
'> Complete ban on certain things.\n\nLike what ?'
"If you're comparing Kashmir's situation to the situation of Uyghurs, you're basically acknowledging that India is a fascist regime."
"Do that and you will attract UN sanctions. China is the manufacturing huh for most companies hence they can violate rights without any sanctions , India doesn't , even Russian economy is crippling under UN sanctions . This government has managed to fuck up Kashmir even more than previous governments , who would've thought oppressing people taking away their rights and making the army unaccountable for their crimes in J&K would lead to distrust in the masses ."

'Shopian has a history and Kashmir has a present     \n       \n\n> “They found five litres of semen inside Neelofar’s body while conducting her postmortem.” The boy who says this is about 16 and lives in Kulgam in South Kashmir. He says he was told this at a ‘conference’ in his village recently. The teenager is convinced of this ludicrous claim about Neelofar Jan, one of the two women found dead in a rivulet in Shopian in South Kashmir in May 2009. After allegations of their rape and subsequent murder by security forces spread thick and fast that summer, there was widespread unrest in the state. In the din raised by the separatist machinery, the truth did not seem to matter at all. The probability of the two women having drowned was rejected. It did not matter that from 1995 to 2008, ten other people had drowned in the same rivulet (from 2010 to 13, three more did). It did not matter that on orders of the then Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, a police officer tried to make a horse cross the rivulet from the same spot, but was unable to: the animal was too afraid to try. It did not matter that an independent team of doctors from Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) performed a second autopsy on the two bodies and ruled out rape, establishing their death as asphyxia as a result of ante-mortem drowning. Later, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a chargesheet against six Kashmiri doctors and others, including the brother of one of the deceased, for fabricating evidence. One of the doctors, the CBI found, had fudged the vaginal swab samples to falsely show that the women were raped.    \n       \n[source](http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/cover-story/who-lost-kashmir)'
"The Government can't possibly have made a mistake here. It is the citizens fault through and through."
'Oh fuck off! \n\nThere has been violence since 1989. This has been going on since then, just not openly. \n\nMuslims killing Muslim is halal. Hindus do it and its haram. Hypocrisy at its finest. \n\nYou realize civilians died as well in the attack, right? Did they want to die? Did these terrorist take their permission before killing them? '
'Insurgencies cannot be defeated by military force alone, because they have the support of the public. You also need to win the hearts and minds of people. Only then insurgency can die out. \n\nWe have tried the stick and carrot method in Kashmir just like we did in Punjab. We barely won in Punjab, but totally failed in Kashmir. We need a bigger carrot. Our stick is already very big. \n\nIf we cannot win back the people of Kashmir, then we will lose that territory.\n\nThere is another way. Use of pure force to suppress people. Declare that army will indiscriminately kill 50 civilians for every soldier killed. Violence will stop completely. The Nazis did this in Poland. '
'We do wonder why the rapes and kidnappings are needed?\n\nWe wonder why there are barely any prosecutions?\n\nWe wonder why civilians were tied to cars and given a sight seeing tour for every other civilian to watch and shown their true status in India?\n\nWe wonder why there are constant pissing contests with the police?\n\nWe also wonder why the system has broken down to such a level that there are at times more armed forces in the cities then standing at the border?\n\nSo much to wonder, man..!!'
'LTTE was a defacto government . With a leader, governing body, area of influence , an army , navy and miniature air force. They used to collect the tax. It is easier to fight an enemy who is this much crystalised. In Kashmir there is no such thing. There are tens of terrorist groups. Similar number of political separatist groups. It is difficult to fight amorphous enemy . Even US could not do it in Vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan . '
'>the ground realities of constant and unflinching violence mean it\'s very difficult for army to let their guard down\n\nI assume that "reaching out" implies the government making concessions at the negotiations table and not the army just letting up.'
'well, the status quo was maintained for 60 years. What I am saying is Doval doctrine may ensure that the status quo is broken in a matter of few years. We could soon lose control of  the situation.\n'
'The accession of the state was legal. It was ratified by Kashmir Constituent assembly. To let go it would need a constitutional amendment (I guess , I am not a constitutional expert). Which is a political suicide for any government.'
'It is for the same reason why China does not want to give up on Tibet or Taiwan. No one gives up territory voluntarily. What makes you think Kashmir will be independent? It will be a resource poor country surrounded by 3 nuclear powers, one of which tried to annex it way back in 1947. How will it defend itself? What will be the foundation of its economy?'
"There are a number of reasons:\n\n\n1. Sunk cost. Do you have any idea how much has been spent in holding on to Kashmir in terms of money and man power. The politician who gives up Kashmir will live with that legacy for the rest of his life.\n\n\n2. Where the hell is half a million troops going to go. The entire insurgency provides employment for thousands of Indians and with the constant dying there is no shortage of openings. Its basically the government biggest job generator.\n\n\n3. Do you have any idea how much money it would cost to shit the capital from Delhi. If we lose Kashmir, Delhi becomes vulnerable. Those fat ass netas love Dilli and it's constant air pollution. Its the most Indian city on the planet.\n\n\n4. Leh and all those places fall to China and that would make the people there very unhappy.\n\n\n5. The south is going to break away too. If Kashmir does not have to pay taxes to support BIMARU then why does South or northeast India? Why should hard working people have to pay for the inability of BIMARU's to use a condom?\n\n\nThere is much more but this is the gist."
'I live in the US. Half my friends are Pakistani, my neighbor is Pakistani. I honestly don\'t even notice it anymore, except when they start talking shit about India\'s "rape culture" and our "right-wing Hindu extremist government." I can bitch about India all I want, but its a little hard to take from a Pakistani. But as my neighbor says "India ko sudhar ne mein pachaas saal lagenge, aur Pakistan ko paanch hazaar" so it\'s all good.'
"Where does electing Modi equal hating Pakistanis? \n\nModi won because people were shit tired of the Congress, that's it. \n\nThe federal power has transitioned between these two parties for ages. It's really nothing new. Time was up for Congress, that's all. \n\nStop going down the USA route of placing labels on who voting for whom. \n\n"
"I don't understand this fascination to repeatedly state that Indians and Pakistanis are the same. How about our fellow Sri Lankans, Nepalese, Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Burmese, Indonesian, Thai etc.? These nations don't harbour the kind of hostility that is displayed by Pakistan nor am I aware of these nations fighting multiple wars with India nor am I aware there are terrorists in these nations getting state support and funding to attack India. \n\nIndia's relationship with Pakistan should depend on what Pakistan does and its policies, not by some belief that we are the same people. An Indian can have great relationships with Pakistani but don't expect it to determine state policy"
"I've grown up in the middle throughout the 90s and the 00s and I can confirm this. I've seen Bangladeshis, Pakis, Sri Lankans. We're all the same, our cultures are much more deeply linked than we think. I've seen both progressive and the ultra-conservative folks. Strike a conversation and you'll immediately realise that our tastes are the same. Yea we follow different Gods, but at the end of the day, we were all immigrants trying to earn our daily bread in a foreign country. \n\nThis is why I feel social media has made us feel that we are different. Folks should get out and talk to other people instead of reading comments and tweets and labelling them. Our governments have disappointed us all equally and we label our neighbours based on the acts of their governments. You can be a Modi bhakt or Kejriwal bhakt or a commie, its fine. This us vs them attitude is seriously driving a wedge between our own people. I've said this before and I'll say this again if the British introduced Divide and rule, we've let our politicians carry that on. all these caste and religion politics is exactly that. The dumb folks have the microphone on the social media and we get a feel that's how the other group is. No, it isn't! Get out and talk to people. \n\nHappy holidays folks!"
"How the Fuck is voting BJP equal to hating Muslims? You ask for peace and all that but you generalise a million people casually as Muslim haters?\n\nMy family and friends also vote Modi but not one of them hate any minority. We stay clear of evangelical types because of a bad experience in the family but that's about it. "
'Err no. If you think so, you are *Homo sapiens antinationlus* instead of the regular *Homo sapiens sapiens*. '
"Sorry I've to disagree. We can find commonalities amongst any civilization and conclude we are the same. Everybody faces persecution or fight against poverty, etc. \n\nIf the Pakistanis want to have a separate Nation and a culture they have the right to it.

Modi\'s attacks on Congress were mainly because he claimed them to be weak on terrorism.

Internally I was going like "I don\'t want to sit next to such a guy. Why does he have to read this in a public place."\n\nThen I realized had I been sitting next to someone with a shaven head reading the Bhagavad  Gita, my disgust would not be as intense. \n\nNow I consider myself liberal, atheist and all that, and hold no love for any religion. But I would still feel more comfortable sitting next to a Pandit than to a Maulvi. \n\nI realized then that it is just prejudice in my heart and nothing to do with the guy\'s actions.

Most people are downright lazy when it comes to exploring new music. Hence, they don't look beyond TV, radio or Billboard.\n\nAlso, Bollywood music has always been vocal centric. Not that this is a bad thing but because of this, a lot of people don't enjoy instrumental music or can't stand long sections which only have instruments in them."

"I have never seen BJP owning up their actions. Can't expect tolerence from people with such insecurity whose go to solutions for anything are ban and coercion."
"Modi is more authoritarian than Congress. Congress is rotten and corrupt, but I feel they have, at the top at least, a decent idea that they are rotten and corrupt. Too many people around Modi along with the man himself probably believe he's on some sort of tryst with destiny. "
'A disclaimer first: Answers to such (indeed, any) social question can always only be a theory since one cannot test it on the mass population. So, the best one can do it come up with a logical conclusion that feels about right.\n\nHaving gotten that out of the way, I have a couple of theories which I believe complement each other - \n\n1. Cult of personality - Modi has been extremely successful in building that cult of personality. So, what happened is that people voted for Modi, not BJP. He gave a "face" to the resolutions to the problems of a billion people Now, it\'s impossible for one man, no matter how large his chest, to solve all the problems even of his own home, let alone a large nation. So, when things start to fall apart, people don\'t blame the government, they blame the person. The only way to quell such resistance is by crushing it. Hence, BJP IT cell. But, according to me that\'s only part of the issue...\n\n2. Willingness of people - ...the second issue is willingness of people themselves. In a country that has a distinct lack of heroes, we tend to deify anyone who seems/is a little out of the usual league. An analogy is Sachin Tendulkar. I am not saying he is not a kickass batsman. But, there are other batsmen with comparable records (Ponting, Sangakkara, Dravid, etc.) or could boil down to personal style (My fav batsman is Steve Waugh and have I faced the wrath of Sachin fanboys for saying I prefer him over Sachin!!). Yet, they don\'t have legions of fanatics calling them "God". Most (not all) of these fanboys don\'t even have a basic understanding of cricket and just parrot the stats without understanding the context. The reason is simple - we lack heroes. So, we look into meaningless stats to feel good about ourselves and any attack on those people is deemed as an attack on ourselves. Coming back to my point. Same is the case with Modi. Any attack on Modi is an attack on themselves and they are defending themselves.'
"BJP's intolerance is easily understandable when you consider the mass atrocities they have committed including hacking muslims down to death in Gujrat, the Babri Masjid demolition etc.  \n\n\nIn DPRK criticism of Kim Jong Un is not permitted, in India we are progressing towards the same state of affairs - totalitarianism. "
'Congress JUST tried to ban a movie on Indira Gandhi a few months ago and threatened violence, how short are your memories?'
"No idea. Maybe because BJP has formed such a image or they have a strong IT cell. \n\nOne reson I think is that large amount of people that is getting involved in political debates online and offline today has been introduced to political criticism for the first time with the introduction of Internet in so many places. This people don't know how to take criticism. "
'"Strongmen" leaders thrive on a base that will fanatically support and defend them, and will continue to stoke the flames ever so to keep the base fired up on sociopolitical issues. You can see similarities in the case of Putin, Erdogan, Idi Amin, and now Trump, and on "the other side" to Stalin, Mao, Little Rocket Man and his Dad, Mugabe etc. It is the standard operating procedure to run a very tight ship, where absolutely no criticism is allowed because it will weaken their image in the minds of their core base. Most of their moderate support base will restrict themselves to verbal diarrhea (as in social media warriors), but if pushed to "come out on the streets", they will refrain and let the fanatics do the job. The moderates are also usually the ones that have to invent more and more ridiculously hypocritical arguments to continue justifying their support, while the fanatics don\'t care for such arguments since they\'re blatantly supporting a very narrow core agenda in the manifesto that is generally controversial. The Trump saga unfolding currently is a great example and a case study in the psyche of the average "supporter". Authoritarian leaders have existed throughout history, it\'s only recently that they\'ve mastered the art of disguising their intentions behind the shroud of democracy. \n\nI also believe it\'s a self fulfilling prophecy and a vicious cycle, such that it is impossible for these strongmen leaders to dissociate themselves from this image once they\'ve used it to get in power, even if they had a change of heart. '
"Fascists are always afraid of a Pen. That's why.\n\nWhatever shit UPA might have done, I never felt afraid to criticize them openly. "
"Because people have short memories. Remember when the lord of liberal democracy, Nehru, jailed 29 year old Majrooh Sultanpuri for criticism of government's foreign policy? People with long memories remember.\n\nRemember the ma beta tag team of Sanjay and Indira?\n\nRemember when young Renuka Chowdhary was rounding off political opponents during emergency?\n\nRemember Khemka when he went after Vadra?\n\nRemember when the liberal government attacked Kejriwal when he was a part of IAC leaving out every bit of his personal information, even hounding his wife, then a government servant? People remember.\nRemember when government sent a barrage of lathi wielding cops on peaceful protestors at ramleela grounds. People remember.\n\nRemember TADA imposed on 15000 protesting farmers in Gujarat?\n\nModi government and the BJP have been fairly benign compared to the previous government. Their attempts at being evil have been childish at best. So for the edgy Randians who believe things haven't been as bad as they are today, as far as media and political freedom are considered, things are a lot better today. They are not perfect, but then again, less of a shit show."
'I have said this several times, but let me say once more. \n\n1. While there may be a few that do not like any criticism, a large number of us do not mind it at all. Heck, if criticism makes him or his team think more and do better things, then it is irrational for me to not welcome it.\n\n2. Things become complicated when people either criticize him for EVERYTHING, or do not acknowledge the good things being done, or keep calling people who are on balance in the BJP camp for now as "right wingers".'
"May be because BJP is new to power. Congress is like...yeah, let people cry, we will continue our corruption and stuff. They don't have much choice, and sooner or later, we will come back. BJP is new to power, and are scared that if they loose it, they are not sure when they will come back. The reason I feel they are so defensive about Modi and his policies is because deep down, they are scared of losing. Every criticism gnaws at their insecurities, makes them bite their nails. As each of their policy looks more like flop, they become more scared, defensive and paranoid. Just my two paise..."

"Personality cults need to die asap. Yesterday I was reading PhD thesis of Stephen Hawkings which is now publically available.

It is pathetic that here, if you criticize a leader whom you have elected, all hell breaks loose. We are never really taught to ask questions. Maybe that's why we are good followers but poor leaders.  "
"The problem with us is that we have to defend our political choices and take it personally when our choice is questioned by others. This reason applies to a vast majority of us. The very abusive nature of this sub is a testament to this.\r\n\r\nThe BJPs only brand value is that of Modi. Any efforts to tarnish that is an threat to party's existence. So party workers primary role seems to be PR work for Modi and they have been at it very aggressively. Lol.\r\n\r\nAs regards the barrage of defamation cases, let me place that almost every politician who knows to sign has pressed or threatened to press charges defamation including the very honourable Chidambaram. I personally believe defamation provisions are draconian and should be watered down so as to prevent its overarching  reach on freedom of speech.\r\n\r\nThe BJP of today, apart from a handful, seems to be a legion of faceless men with brainless approach. The sheer rhetoric and lack of reason is very disturbing. \r\n\r\nI am centre right in opinion and voted for Modi. \r\nI personally think, the vote I cast, is a function of my expectations and the choice presented to me. In 2014, Modi was clearly 'one eyed among blind'. Still is. But lack of criticism wont help anybody.\r\n\r\nThiruvalluvar, a poet, wrote in tamil, that a king without critics will lead himself to ruin even if he hath no enemies.

'Let me get this straight ? You educated people think Modi is worse than Congress in suppressing dissent ? I am not sure if it\'s the selective amnesia or genuine ignorance !\n\n\n\nI am pretty liberal in all aspects and can\'t really answer for extreme right wingers who just like many leftists are against criticism of any type and threaten violence at drop of a hat.\n\n\nJust at the top of my head I can list these incidents which make Modi look like a saint even with all the allegations, (most of them turn out to be bullshit sensationalism anyway)\n\n\n1) Only Emergency and dismissal of civil rights in India by Indira.\n\n2) Forcible sterilisation of poor by Sanjay Gandhi .\n\n3) God awful nepotism in Congress since 1947 which ensures that only the Nehru descendent\'s who present themselves as Gandhis can hold meaningful posts.\n\n4) Nurturing of Khalistani terrorists like Bhindrawale against political opponents in Punjab and raid of Golden Temple when he went out of control.\n\n5) Bans on books, artists and more if they were posting anything against votebank like Salman Rushdie, VS Naipul, Bettelheim, MO Mathai an numerous others. \n\n6) Even satire like Kissa Kursi Ka was banned by Congress as was serious commentary like Aandhi. \n\nI can post a whole thesis on suppression of free speech and how it was worse and is still much worse in Congress regimes and is as worse in so called secular party regimes like TMC, SP and BSP. Not mentioning their deeds because it will be too long.\n\n\nWhat cases are being filed ? One against The Wire for an article which presented losses (in negative numbers) as profits and claimed that politicians\'s son got undue benefits ? Is suing someone for so idiotic slander bad ?\nI am honestly not aware of any significant state sponsored suppression of anti-Modi, anti-BJP propaganda like Congress and other "secular" political parties do routinely. \n\n\nOr are you talking about Jaitley suing Kejriwal for the sustained verbal diarrhea ? \n\nI am all for free speech but when someone starts lying and starts spreading baseless propaganda like Kejru, The Wire, NDTV do, I am all for suing them. Do you think that suing is not a good action for slander  ?\n\n\n\n\nI crticise Modi and the current regime whenever they deserve it for things like bad implementation of GST, slow progress on defence related issues and so on. But criticism should be reasonable. I find it very annoying when people will criticise Modi for wholly stupid things like their house getting flooded with water , murder of "journalists" like Gauri Shankar, (both in congress states ), over the top actions of so called cow vigilantes in some random remote location and so on.\n\n\nAs far as social media is concerned, even the comparatively "sophisticated" , educated liberal supporters of Congress, AAP and other parties are much worse than most rabid right wingers. Just take a look at twitter time lines of people like Tehseen, Bainjal, Alka Lamba, Ram Subraniam, Ankit Lal, Abhishek Mishra, Amaresh Misra and numerous others. I follow them and they never fail to do worse than most lumpen right wingers I wouldn\'t touch with 20 feet pole.\n\n\nThere are morons on each side, but BJP side for me is better for India and my ideals as an atheist, patriotic, liberal citizen.\n\n\n\nI know that there are a lot of edgy teenagers here who think that nobody apart  from people like them who follow a supposedly liberal ideology (mostly a cut-and-paste template from other countries ) can have any reasonable opinion. But here it is. It is up to you to either accept that there are different shades of right wing and Modi supporters and that the so called "liberals" are very often just spreading fake outrage propaganda. \n'

'The popular myth of Mahabali is not the only myth. There are many versions of similar stories that prevail in the district of Wayanad amongst the Paniyas and the Adiyas – former slaves of Brahmin/upper caste masters. In their versions, Brahmin landlords trick a tribal chieftain, always known as ‘Maveli’, by using various methods to usurp his land and to enslave his people. This researcher has identified at least five different Maveli myths in the district – all from the tribal community.\n\nThe recurring motifs of colonisation, Brahmanical oppression and enslavement/banishment suggest that these myths (which are also prevalent in other Indian states as well as other countries such as Thailand, Trinidad and Malaya) emerged as counter narratives against colonialism, Brahmanism, casteist oppression and possible as a powerful narrative against violent Aryanisation/Sanskritisation in the ancient, medieval and early modern periods.'
'That has been going on for the past 30 years. The violence had come down post early 2000s, but since the BJP gained power in the centre in 2014, there has been an upswing. It worsened in 2016 when CPM came to power in the state. '
'There was a large scale migration of Brahmins into Kerala during the 8th to 10 th century AD from present day Karnataka and Andhra regions.

The Madurai bench of the high court sought responses from the state government and Government of India on the issue.\n\nThe Centre’s move had generated strong response from politicians across the country, particularly in Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. ‘Beef fests’ have been organised across the country in protest against the Centre’s decision. In Kerala, Youth Congress Workers and organisations associated with the Left took out protest marches against the government.

Do you know the difference between "writing off" and "waving off"? Mallya is not scot-free, will be arrested if he returns to India and he still owes the bank money. All the bank has done is remove it from its "receivables" section in its balance sheet. Only likely recoverable debts are maintained there, and its accounting policy to remove doubtful debts and its not necessarily an "asset" to the company, and is wrongly inflating its net worth.\n\n\n\nOnce again, write off is not equal to waiving off, which is what you are saying the Government did.

That it was Muslims getting butchered mercilessly and not Hindus and Muslims fighting. That the curfew was only for Muslims while Hindu mobs roamed the streets without any problems. That the mob burning a motorcycle that was shown on TV was nothing compared to the women and children burnt alive throughout the state.

'>All airlines overbook. It is a standard practice. Remember half empty flights in the 80s, 90s and even early 2000s? Do you see of that these days?\n\nYep. I am trying to recall if it was Lufthansa or some other airline, but one of the majors announced a few years ago that they had taken to overbooking even *first class* seats! apparently a no-show there hurts even more than the cost of compensating high-rollers!'
'Yeah, United does this shit all the time - it\'s a given that they overbook their flight and will then go begging for "volunteers" to go on a later flight with some extra credit. Those who aren\'t really going for anything urgent and can wait (like students going home) often do this to avail the small credit they get out of it. \n\nWhat\'s more disingenuous, though, is when airlines like Delta, for red-eye flights, just straight up cancel "last flight of the night" runs because they haven\'t sold enough seats, stranding people at the airport. Happened to me in June and it pissed me the fuck off. '
'Question is, what sort of legal protections do existing laws offer the people affected by this? If an airline were to refuse to board someone with a valid ticket, does he/she need to be compensated for the inconvenience? Like being accommodated on the next available flight at no extra charge, a hotel stay if required, etc. etc?'
"Either that or non-JP members who hadn't checked in yet were going to get a rude shock when they showed up to the airport. As a general rule, you don't mess with pax that have already checked in."
">If an airline were to refuse to board someone with a valid ticket, does he/she need to be compensated for the inconvenience? \n\nHas happened to me. They asked if you can take the next flight, and they'll reimburse you for the time spent.\nI didn't take it up because I was on a connecting flight. \n "
'This is a clear case of a contract being broken. So, it is patently illegal. This is also why they want you to sign a letter saying that they bear no liability for your losses if you get late - to avoid the legal repercussions.\n\nSince, class action lawsuits can not be undertaken in India, the airlines are just depending on the fact that an individual will not bother to take them to courts over a missed flight and those very few who do can be compensated with a settlement.'
'The terms dont promise anything like that..\n\nBut upvote for mentioning class action lawsuits... india really needs them. ill sue those mall shops for selling above mrp first of all'
'It is not, it is perfectly legal under the DGCA rules. Based on this post, even the compensation offered - put on the next flight + 2.5k cash compensation seems in line with DGCA rules.'
"That is in addition to the full fare refund / alternative flight.\n\nI understand that it stinks, but this is a worldwide practice and the numbers are very low - not even 0.1% of all pax get bumped from flights.\n\nI have been bumped off once and it sucked, but in this case as I am a higher tier FF member, I was offered a stay in the airport 5* hotel and the next flight out. As I wasn't in any hurry, I accepted it, but yes, if you are in a hurry and this happens to you, you are shit out of luck."

"I think Indian politics has changed for the worse after the 90s, and the congress sowed the seeds of their own destruction. Prime ministers are ultimately just a face of an ideology.\n\nThe INC was established with the goal of upstanding, typically western educated intellectuals leading the country forward. Borrowing the good things from the capitalist west, and what were seen as good things of the soviet system - like an extensive bureacracy (almost a bad word now) and a technocracy. Things settled into a virtual 1 party system.\n\nUnfortunately corruption seeped in, state-level powers asserted control and broke off.\n\nThe death knell was Rajiv Gandhi deciding to open the locks on Ayodhya. This heralded the ascendancy of the Hindu far right, which had been thus far subdued.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is Indian society in it's basest form driving democracy. Government is much more populist and caters to majoritarian desires which were up till now kept bottled up. It never really helped that the Sangh had infiltrated the INC even before independence.\n\nIndia will regress into more feudalism, more populist thugs leading states and much more violent and murderous sectarian clashes. Maybe someday things will get better when the average Indian gets educated and achieves a decent standard of living. But right now, things are pretty grim."

'Every balanced political system has a left-wing and a right-wing.\n\nTo expect that the right wing would never take hold in India is foolishly naive. As a democracy, our politics will reflect the priorities and _mood swings_ of the population. Surge of the right was long overdue, as the conservative Hindu majority felt being alienated by the minority appeasement and vote bank politics of the so-called left parties.\n\nThe pendulum will swing back and forth until both sides develop a distinct identity and an ideology. Both sides are at an extremely immature stage right now, with differences in ideology being both limited to social aspects and being superficial. Domination of the right for a decade will probe the left to reinvent itself and form a better identity, while eventual rejection of the right coupled with an increase in progressive population will force the right to abandon the extreme elements of its ideology, and develop a more mature platform to contest on.'

Indeed a maddening job.  And that is why these women left, women mostly prefer easy jobs, they thought it is cool, got to get the reality, will just blame men for everything.  Low pay may be linked to monthly bonuses for those who work hard and earn extra.  Women are probably put in low rush routes so that it is easy for them, but then will get lower pay.\n\nEdit: Here is the crux of artile:\n\n> Unlike KSRTC bus stations, private bus stands have no comfort stations for women conductors, making life difficult for them.  Often work starts as early as 5 a.m. and goes on till 9 p.m. which implies that only a few who live along the route of the services can manage it,” M.B. Satyan, president, Kerala State Private Bus Operators’ Federation reportedly said.\n\nAlmost all bus stands in Kerala have toilets for women, since even passengers have to manage it.  The reality is that private bus conductor is a hard job.

'About beggars in India: I don\'t see beggars in poor areas (think villages in UP) but mostly in cities, especially Delhi. Cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore have probably lower begging population than Delhi. I have no idea about Mumbai, never been there. Not all poor people are beggars, somehow I\'ve come to think that poor people probably do not like beggars. Maybe people who beg are socially ostracized. It happens to manual scavengers, because of their job they are discriminated against. I can\'t imagine how other poor people are going to be fine with beggars. Say you\'re a beggar and you earn well enough to think you can afford a roof over your head, yet probably no one is going to rent you a roof. Poor people who do hard labour to earn their living probably want nothing to do with beggars. \n\nSo given the social costs (conjecture) of taking up begging, why people do it? Because social norms are weak in cities? You can\'t beg in a village, everyone knows everyone; in a city nobody knows anyone. Maybe a good number of beggars are illegal immigrants? You\'re in a new country, you left your home, have no identity, friends or relatives to support you (no social costs).\n\nThe discussion is controversial, I\'ve never really had it with anyone. I also don\'t want to propagate any unfounded notions, "all beggars are Bangladeshis" and whatnot. I am mostly confused by begging, I see it everyday, and I don\'t give money to beggars (mostly because I am a student and I have little money of my own). And, even when I do have money of my own, I just don\'t see how I can incentivise something like begging. '

"I remember many years ago reading about a study conducted in Kerala that said begging had very little actual connection with being poor, meaning it's more of a psychological thing than being poor. According to the study not all people who beg do so because they are poor. In fact that study stated that some of the beggars who were given a jobs came back to begging after some time. \n\nThis apparently irritated few people in Kerala. I even heard that begging was made illegal there which made the whole rather ironic and sad. "

"Lol without judiciary reforms don't expect solution to attacks on journalists "
'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Attacks on journalists in India: Not a single murder has been solved in the last 10 years** \n\n ______ \nOn Sunday night, police officers in Kerala’s Varkala town allegedly assaulted journalist Sajeev Gopalan and stripped him in front of his wife and 15-year-old daughter. Gopalan, 49, says he was targeted because of a story that he had done against the police a few months ago. The case is another reminder of the challenging conditions in which many journalists in the vernacular media work. This month itself has seen a spate of such attacks. Two days after Kannada journalist Gauri Lankesh was murdered near her Bengaluru home on September 5, two bike-born assailants shot dead Pankaj Mishra, a journalist with Rashtriya Sahara in Bihar’s Arwal district. On September 20, television reporter Shantanu Bhowmick was abduced and killed in Tripura while covering a political demonstration. Since 2015, as many as 142 attacks against journalists have been registered in the country, according to the latest data available with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). As many as 70 journalists were killed in India between 1992 and 2016. Many of them were independent journalists who were murdered close to their home or their workplace.\n\nThe alarming frequency with which journalists are being attacked gives rise to a number of disturbing questions. Why do attackers —politically motivated or otherwise —believe they can get away with attacking journalists? One reason could be the absence of a deterrent and a lackadaisical justice system. According to international non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists, not a single journalist’s murder in India had been solved over the past decade. The State needs to ensure stringent punishment for the perpetrators if a journalist is assaulted or intimidated in connection with the performance of duty.\n\nA few years ago, disturbed with the flood of attacks against journalists, the Press Council of India had recommended making this a cognisable offence punishable with a five-year prison term. But nothing came out of it. That appears to be part of the problem. Many recommendations of the Press Council don’t see the light of the day. There is a case for introducing a regulatory body with a robust redressal mechanism for journalists who are intimidated or attacked. This is the least that can be done for journalists who put their lives on the line while doing their duty.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'
'This shows how there is little difference between various state and central governments. All of these bastards are complicit to give us the kind of shit India has to live through each day - dead journalists one day, dead kids the other.'
'Regarding Gauri Lankesh\'s murder, I have two theories:\n\n1. She was murdered by one of her own comrade folks. This is most likely scenario and it has happened before. It was also revealed that she was in touch with some maoists who wanted to surrender and be reformed with her help. Now how many times has it not happened that such a reformer activist was killed by the "other" maoists who didn\'t want to surrender and saw her as a divider among them?\n2. It was also clear from her WhatsApp screenshots posted on twitter that she was involved in something related to ISI. So, something may have backfired there, maybe the ISI, RAW or one of the other agencies killed her? Again, we may never know about it if such a thing had happened.\n\nThe third possibility of the right wing murdering her is totally remote. There are hundreds of activists who daily work against them and cause far more damage than someone like Gauri Lankesh, so they clearly don\'t have a motive here.'

"Read Udayakumar's letter to Shweta Kothari below:\n\nDate: October 13, 2017\n\nFrom: S. P. Udayakumar\n\nTo: Ms. Shweta Kothari\n\nHope you remember me, Shweta. You visited my home on April 8, 2017, received my free books, enjoyed my family’s hospitality and backstabbed me and my family so mercilessly and cruelly. You lied to me that your name was Shweta Sharma and that you were a “research scholar” from the Cardiff University in the UK. You asked for my help with your “dissertation research.”\n\nOn April 9, 2017 you requested me to stop by your hotel room as you had a few more questions. There you told me “one of [your] British professors” was very keen on supporting our struggle against the Koodankulam nuclear power plant. \n\nOn both those occasions, you were secretly recording me and my conversation illegally, immorally and indelicately without any qualms about the journalistic ethos. It is interesting to note that you are upset that Arnab Goswami suspected you of “being a mole.” I am sure you have heard the saying “those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.” Your calm demeanor, gentle head shake, deceitful smile, ungrateful attitude, lying through your teeth and the sheer criminality all make you very capable of being a mole of not just an MP but a whole array of foreign agencies.\n\nWhen your criminal boss called you a mole, the proposition was “ridiculous,” and even a “witch-hunt” for you. But when you accused thousands and thousands of hardworking and well-meaning ordinary citizens of India of being stooges of the Catholic Church, greedy for foreign money and all that abhorrent nonsense without a shred of any evidence, you thought it was high class journalism, right?\n\nYou are raving and ranting about your “Reporting Manager who diligently spent time going through my social network profiles and later proposed that I maybe a SPY and also took it up with Arnab Goswami.” How interesting! You walked into my home, spent hours with an unsuspecting host family (comprising my aged parents, trusting wife, friendly son), recorded all the conversations secretly exactly as a SPY would do and betrayed our love and trust.\n\nOh, so “[t]he humiliation continued for a few more days,” eh? Your “financial status was inquired (proposing that [you] may have been getting paid by Mr Tharoor),” ha? Your colleagues were questioned on whether “[you] try to extract information, right?\n\nHow many days did you, your stupid boss and other morons in your TV humiliated us, the noble people who have been struggling against an authoritarian government who was imposing  dangerous nuclear projects on us? Didn’t you probe our financial status and try to extract information through SPY cameras and hidden equipment, Shweta?\nThey questioned your “loyalty” too? And you have a “famous poem that still continues to be [your] cover picture” on Twitter? And does it talk about loyalty, Shweta? Very funny! You know that word, ha? Do you know what it means to be “loyal”?\n\nYou are crying aloud now: “Nobody bothered to clarify. I was left in the lurch. My loyalty questioned, my vanity hurt.” It does hurt, doesn’t it, Shweta? Other human beings also have similar feelings, you know? You are hurt by the “scrutiny of character” that Arnab and his mad gang did on you? Weren’t you doing the same on us all, just a few months back and crying hoarse to the whole country on your TV without even asking yourself if it was all fair to do so.\n\nAnd on 30th May, 2017, you “had done a sting operation on a sitting SHO for a story” and your Editor accused you of ‘flirting’ with the SHO? How sad! Your Editor “threatened to make the conversation public and destroy [your] career”? I wonder what you guys talked about. The conversation must have been that randy and rousing to destroy someone’s career.\n\nWhen my teenage son came to know about your stinking “sting operation” on me, do you know what he said, Shweta: “This woman could have killed you ‘Pa!” If one keeps on doing this kind of “sting operation” for a living, one will not only flirt or fornicate, s/he would even murder! \n\nI particularly like your statement: “The culture of fear, intimidation and harassment I have seen in the last few months is unparalleled.” You also say: “Never have I witnessed such vindictive and vicious conduct.” These are nice statements, Shweta! Do you realize now what you have been doing to unsuspecting people like me with your criminal bosses? Read these statements aloud in front of a mirror, Shweta! You may understand better!\n\nIt’s really funny that you are still “thankful to the organisation for giving [you] a great learning experience and abundant opportunities…” Opportunity to do what? To do what they have been doing to you, right? You have not regretted a bit about the wretched things you have been doing to other people. You only want Arnab and the gang to stop “this pattern of vilification of employees on the basis hearsay.” If they do, your Arnab, your nosy Editor and all others will continue to be good, noble and nationalistic leaders and you are quite fine with them. Right, Shweta?\n\nYou close your great manifesto with the simple question “what good am I as a journalist?” You may be anything, a spy, a mole, or an infiltrator as your bosses  allege! But certainly not a good journalist! And you know what, what you sow, so shall you reap!"

"Who do I hate? I'm so confused."
'A day after Republic TV senior correspondent Shweta Kothari resigned and lashed out at Arnab Goswami for " witch-hunting" her for being an alleged spy of Shashi Tharoor,  anti-nuclear activist SP Udayakumar has written a hard-hitting reply to the female journalist.\n\nShweta, earlier this year, had conducted a sting operation for the channel on Udayakumar, against which he had filed a complaint with the Press Council of India for harassment.  \n\nUdayakumar in an open letter asked Shweta what moral right does she have to complain about being wrongly accused and spied upon, after having "mercilessly backstabbed" his entire family. \n"It is interesting to note that you are upset that Arnab Goswami suspected you of \'being a mole.\' I am sure you have heard the saying \'those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword\' - he said in the letter.\n\nUnder the disguise of being a research scholar with foreign connections ready to make financial aid for the Koodankulam struggle, Shweta had secretly recorded conversations with Udayakumar which was later aired by the channel. The broadcast showed him telling that he cannot receive money from foreign sources through the bank since his account was frozen. He is shown refusing the offer telling her that it could land both of them in trouble.\n\nCalling Arnab a "criminal", Udayakumar wrote that Shweta might now understand the kind of humiliation that himself and the Koodakulam agitators went through upon being labelled "stooges of the Catholic Church, greedy for foreign money," by the channel.\n\nTaking a dig at her statement against the company Reporting Manager for scrutinising her social network profiles and labelling her a spy, Udayakumar asked what else could be a person who recorded an unsuspecting host family including aged people be called.\n\n"How many days did you, your stupid boss and other morons in your TV humiliated us, the noble people who have been struggling against an authoritarian government who was imposing dangerous nuclear projects on us? Didn’t you probe our financial status and try to extract information through SPY cameras and hidden equipment, Shweta?"\n\nIn a post-resignation Facebook update on Friday, Shweta Kothari had described the series of events which led to it. Claiming to be unreasonably dropped from the channel\'s special projects team, Kothari said she is not the sole victim of the channel\'s harassment.\n\nThe sting operation on Udayakumar and other Koodankuulam activists were aired only a few days after the launch of Republic TV. The activist had denied the allegations as lies propagated or better ratings.\n\n"As a result of Arnab Goswami’s slanderous campaign against me, my family and I fear for our safety and security. I hold Arnab Goswami, Shweta Kothari, Sanjeev and Hariharan (another employee of the channel) solely responsible for any untoward incident that may happen to me."- Udayakumar had posted on Facebook on 22 June.'
"Just to take a dig at scummy journalists, people are believing a creationist nut who is against nuclear power? How is he different from a superstitious Hindu Bhakt?\n\nI generally don't care about these stuff but whoever protests against safe nuclear power also has his own opportunistic agendas.

Its not admissible in courts but the information was revealed. Its inconsequential if the journalist at the time employed scummy techniques."
"Journalists, like most professionals, from a sweeper to a hitman, work for money. Where they are paid more, they will run.

One example is Josy Joseph.\n\nSome pretend to be martyrs while being shielded by privilege. These are Dutts and Sardesais. Some have gone past the black hole and have decided that the world is a facade. These are the Goswamis and the Goswami-lites of Times Now, CNN 18 and India Today.\n\nAnd then there's Shweta Kothari. For the first 2-3 years of her life, she wanted to be Josy. Then with a slightly higher salary and more perks, she attempted to be a Dutt like most female television journos aspire to. Then she stopped kidding herself. And ran for the highest paying gig. Fuck ethics behnchod. Republic was giving 2.5x the market salary to entry level journos guys when it was formed. In return, people worked for up to 40 days without a break. Only people spared of the hellfire were Goswami's personal research team that he carried from Times Now.\n\nKothari did the devil's work and the devil eats its own. Simple."

He is the convenor of the People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE), which is protesting against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant project. \n\n> His movement and himself were allegedly exposed in a sting operation carried out by Republic TV where he was caught agreeing to accept foreign funds for protests advising the journalists involved to channel funds to his political party. Udayakumar vehemently denied the allegations. In a letter to Press Council of India Udaya Kumar stated that he had mentioned clearly that he would give receipts and all the money would be accounted for.\n\n> UdayaKumar openly admitted to working towards **creating a separate country for Tamil Nadu** in a public speech. This speech was acknowledged and widely condemned by various political parties in Tamil Nadu.\n\nHe is full of shit and is anti-progress with limited knowledge on the things he is talking about. And, it is kinda obvious that there is some political/financial angle to it. So, no upvote for you, especially for that bad title."

'You shouldn\'t let his backward stance on certain issues speak for what he\'s trying to say in the post.This was specifically about journalist ethics and principles that were lacking in that sting operation ,which the journalist who recently resigned claimed to be lacking in the media company she\'s working in.To me,they seem to be valid points he put forth.\n\nAs for his part in the nuclear protests,its very sad that he thinks it results in more damage to the public than the advantages it has in our society ,which is quite not true.But their concerns are [understandable](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nuclear_and_radiation_accidents_and_incidents) though.There have been many nuclear accidents([Chernobyl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEB0gv_2V_w) and fukishima and such) in the past which were caused by "human error"(incompetence) mostly.So,the regulation and good governance does have a critical role in this whole process.My point being,they do have  some valid concerns amid many falsified claims about nuclear energy itself but ,they should realise that we\'ve come a long way from the incompetence that caused failure in previous incidents and environmental preventive measures taken today are far more advanced than those in the 60s or 70\'s.'

'Going by this post, what she did to that guy was and still is journalism. Undercover Journalism has been a thing for years. If she had lied about what she found out in her operation then she should be criticized.'
"Agreed, it's lunacy to think that a sting operation is the same as being fired / wanting to resign because your boss thinks you are a mole for a political party."
'The problem is despite the sheer minuteness of something going wrong at the plant, what would happen if something did go wrong? We have seen Bhopal, can you really expect the government to do anything? The problem isn\'t the "green activists", its that nobody trusts the Indian government whatever the party in power is. You are wealthy and salaried, you can move to another city. what will a local farmer or fisherman do? \n\n\n'
'Ok then u have the power plant in your backyard. There are risks involved with it and they should be dealt with properly.

'**Halahala**\n\nHalāhala (Sanskrit हलाहल) or kālakūṭa (Sanskrit कालकूटं, literally: \'black mass\' or \'time puzzle\' ) is the name of a poison (as per Hindu mythology) created from the sea when Devas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) churned it (see Samudra manthan) in order to obtain Amrita, the nectar of immortality.\n\nFourteen different rathnas (gems) were recovered in this exercise, mostly retained by the Gods after the Demons tried to cheat them. But before Amrita could be recovered, Halāhala ("the most vicious and venomous poison of universe") was produced, which started killing both sides. As no one could bear the poisonous fumes emitted by the poison, both Devas and Asuras began to collapse due to asphyxiation.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27'
'After Alexander died, his empire fractured into smaller Greek empires. When those smaller empires again fractured, they left behind small kingdoms and Greek city states in modern day  Afghanistan and Pakistan. All these entities were in direct contact with Indian empires and kingdoms and there was a lot of cross-pollination of ideas b/w Indian and Greek civilisations. There was a fusion of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Greek ideas. There were even some Greek kingdoms that invaded and conquered as far as modern day Uttar Pradesh. And these Greek kingdoms ruled northern India for nearly two centuries. Thus you can see there was a massive influence on India.'

The TT was well into the turn when the biker decided that he is not going to slow down.\n\nThe dude barely scraped around the TT, fight started.

Kinda sums up, and confirms what I said.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lquq1/can_anyone_tell_me_why_muslim_graves_often_have/c2uw8lo/\n\n>I'm a practicing Muslim, and would like to support this statement. In almost all sects of Islam, marking the grave with any sort of ornament is avoided. A simple marking is used to show that there is indeed someone buried there, and perhaps this person's name. There are several reasons for this. For instance, one reason is that it shows that, at the end of life, everyone goes to the same place. The wealthy, or royalty end up in the same place as the poor. It is also in keeping with the idea that there is no fancy casket or anything used. In many cases there may be no casket at all, only a white shroud.\nOf course, Muslims also avoid ornamented grave sites because they feel it may encourage saint worship, or basically creation of shrines. Of course, not all Muslims follow this. You can find shrines in many Muslim countries at gravesites, Pakistan for instance. This is based mostly on culture and tradition, however, which still influences all Muslims.\nOne exception is the grave of the Prophet (pbuh). He has no 'two pillars' at his grave site, but it is one of the two holiest mosques in Islam, in Medina. One thing that to understand is that people aren't praying to him, or at him. And his grave is separated from the worshippers.\nI've been there a number of times, and I sometimes feel like it is skirting an edge, but Saudi Arabia is very conservative in this sense, and greatly discourages any worship of the actual site.\nIt is also important to note that it is required of all Muslims to follow the laws of where they live, so long as it does not ask for outright rejection of Islam, regarding things such a burial. So, perhaps wherever you saw these pillars, that was the required minimum marking for a gravesite in that country.\nHere are some links if you'd like more information on Muslim burial: http://www.al-islam.org/laws/burial.html http://www.isna.net/Services/pages/A-Guide-for-the-Muslim-Funeral.aspx"

Really bizarre. '
'wow , talk about missing the point completely . instead of addressing my arguments , which clearly shows your simple mindedness if not downright ignorance ,you have to get personal and side step the very pertinent points i am making , i basically called you out on your disingenuity and misrepresentation of all muslims and pointed out to your dumb generalizations and stereotypes , and am sure i dont need well structured paragraphs and eloquence to pin point the same.'
'does it mean muslims talk out of their ass? '
'exactly , \nand this is what isis do and justify their actions with , it is absolutely based on what sunni islam and the hadith preach however .and this includes , taking slaves and concubines from the conquered or subjugated populations , especially if they are non muslims (isis consider shia , druze , ismails , yezidis , alwaites , bohras and ahmediyyas  and every body other than sunni wahhabis as non muslims)  , child marriage (muhammad , the perfect human being is an example ofcourse )  ,jizya tax ,  4 male witnesses if a woman gets raped ,for the rapists to get punished ,women treated as cattle  and numerous draconian rulings that wouldnt be out of place in the bronze age . \n\nthe funny thing is , what isis are doing now , is not something new , the erstwhile caliphate and the muslim conquerors  (fondly remembered by many muslims ironically )  who ravaged huge swathes of asia and europe , were no different to the current bunch of islamic extremists . they indulged in exactly the same barbaric things that we associate isis with . just that they were successful and didnt have russians and american figter jets barrage bombing them into saw dust. \n\nbut somehow , the moderate sunni muslims instead of devoting energy to islams reformation and making it compatible with modern civilisation , instead indulge in mental gymnastics in order to justify the very many contentious issues within islam and keep crying wolf at anybody and everybody , and worse if anything or any group portrays islam in a negative light i.e muslim terroists ,  call them non muslims and what not and completely miss the point in the process. \n\northodox sunni muslims are clearly violent in their beliefs , too bad ismailism or the other moderate versions of islam did not take off .

I don\'t know. It really makes not much sense to an average Hindi speaker.\n\nI have few doubts though. Can some Bengali answer that while singing the national anthem does he/she uses an \'o\' sound or an \'a\' sound? And does it make any sense to a native Bengali speaker?

">JustWhoAreYouFoolingBJP\n\nThere is a saffronized NRI/migrant bengali demographic - typically Indian in the most stereotypically awful ways, perpetually bitter about having to leave Bengal and always silently muttering hatred towards white people and literally everybody else. 9 times out of 10 they belong to hyper-religious (again in the worst ways - people who are superstitious whatsapp devotees) aspirational class section of society. They always talk about their lost roots, their lost heritage and are some of the most ungrateful and poorly assimilated kinds of migrants you will run into in the West.\n\nThey live in a weird paranoid state where they try and justify their departure from Bengal as just a way to escape persecution from Muslims, or they blame it on Mamata. Or they blame Muslims. Anything other than themselves of course.\n\nOther than that there a few people living in west bengal who are extremely bitter CPM loyalists who have become consumed by an  anti-mamata mentality where partnering with even the BJP, a polar opposite to their own ideology, is okay.\n\nAnd you have ignorant people who believe everything they see on whatsapp and facebook. The gullible idiot league, often who claim to be apolitical.\n\nOne good thing is that none of these demographics have much relevance in elections. They either cannot or do not vote, or they are such a small minority spread out over such a large area that they don't matter. And most of them are from Kolkata constituencies too, which the BJP hasn't really been able to get much traction in anyway. Going by the last assembly and municipality polls."
"Media's job is to spin and twist stories. Same happened with the cow-related lynchings, many of which were reactions to cattle-smuggling incidents and under a poor law and order system - yet every-time a beef angle is added when there wasn't any. Add to that the selective reporting. "
"One thing to remember about the TMC is that most middle class Bengalis tend to dislike her - but the vast majority of the electorate adores her. Of course this so-called middle class is probably less than 5% of the population, often doesn't even vote, or doesn't even live in the state.\n\nMuch of left-leaning media tends to side with CPM, and the CPM in Bengal are fiercely anti-mamata, even though many of the things they criticize her for are things they pioneered.\n\nRW media hates mamata and the further right you go the more alarmist and hateful it gets; naturally.\n\nSo it's really difficult to get a proper picture of the state that isn't just some TMC mouthpiece. I would strongly recommend taking a look at the Telegraph who aren't really pro-CPM or pro-TMC, or reading some of the op/an pieces by Sunanda Datta Ray who tries to delve into her popularity with the masses."
">Are there no laws to charge these people for inciting violence?\n\nThere are but right now it seems BJP's agenda is to just overwhelm Mamata with problems so its harder to govern. Gorkhaland/darjeeling, sikkhim , these riots , Bengal's governor bad mouthing mamata by actively speaking on behalf of bjp(which is illegal btw) and then there's the Bengal BJP wannabe leaders who want to come to power but aren't bengali themselves. its a shitshow."

'In Bengali we call this sort of violence "bhangchur" - aka vandalism. It\'s very common and mob-like behavior, setting vehicles on fire and trashing shops is fairly common. When a person gets run over by a bus - bhangchur happens. When a patient dies in a hospital this happens too. It\'s utterly despicable and the sort of political violence that happens in WB is disgusting too.\n\nRead about this from the CPM era:\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Demand-for-justice-for-victims-of-Burdwan-Sainbari/articleshow/19022991.cms (this is what Congress and TMC had to deal with - it\'s disappointing that they are gradually becoming as bad as this)\n\nIt\'s definitely worrying that people are doing this over a facebook post, but given that this is a rural area most bengalis don\'t particularly care. And since there aren\'t many casualties (just 1 I think?) it doesn\'t really register as a communal riot that we should care about.\n\nAre muslims getting more conservative in bengal ? Maybe some are. Does this really mean Bengal will suffer terrorist attacks from lone wolves ? Nope, highly unlikely. Is there a link between terrorism and conservatism in India ? Probably not.

'Yeah, it would have been an interesting approach if they had done that - allow both GST and VAT/Service Tax to co-exist for a while and make it voluntary to "test" GST features.

"Here the problem is that\n\nOur society didn't develop maturity like the west. So, people might get instigated after someone insults their religion or might be mislead to do riots. In this case, the police is under tremendous pressure to stop everything before anything goes wrong.

"
'> Suicide is never the answer!\n\nSuicide is virtually always a bad decision (so clearly evident in OP\'s story). People refrain from using harsh words like this but in my opinion suicide is just a product of human stupidity. It\'s a bad decision that is irreversible. People think too much about whether it\'s "courage" or "cowardice" or "selfishness". It\'s not a product of some deep-set nihilism about humanity either. It\'s simply an erroneous conclusion. Don\'t be stupid.'

Times when I frickin blew a pressure valve, times when I touched people's shoes, times when I was hungry, angry, and just plain old sadistically depressed. Shit is tough, everybody has demons of their own to battle. That girl got 1180, I could try for a year and still not get that much marks. She definitely\u200b had to try hard for it. If a person had that much capabilities in the first place than suicide sure as hell wasn't and won't be an answer. And glorifying it only sets a bad precedent for others to follow."
'You can never really understand what\'s going on in the mind of someone who commits suicide. I hope you have read this: \n\n*"The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."*\n\n-- David Foster Wallace.\n\nIt is similar to people jumping out of WTC on 9/11 - not because they didn\'t fear the fall but the flames up there seemed more horrifying to them. \n\nHumans are incredibly complex beings. We can\'t reduce people to just being stupid. We need proper mental health programs in this country.'
"Your comment makes suicide seem like routine trivial stuff.\n\n>Don't be stupid.\n\nJesus,what leads people to become this fucking smug?"
"If you wanted sensitive comments, you are in wrong part of the internet :)\n\nI am not trying to be an asshole - just pointing out the obvious.\n\n\nFor example, if I were to commit suicide because of your comment, i'd insist that no one would blame you ! It is as simple as that."
'>When the going gets tough, the tough get going.\n\n...But not to do suicide.'
"I really don't think that having psychological problems would not qualify as a tough situation.\n"
"Yeah, I'm saying I don't think it's right to blame the media here more than other parties. And you are just assuming that about the media, but I doubt you have examples of such a story being run by a reputable media outlet."
"Which is why I prefaced by saying that it's harsh. My point is that suicide isn't as deep or well-thought as people make it out to be. It's just poor decisionmaking, which I concede is a simplification because emotions cloud decisionmaking in that moment, but the fact remains true."
'How the fuck is that relevant to what I said? She got good marks-> media sees she is poor-> highlights her story (for her or their own good is up for debate)->people come forward with financial aid. No one was forcing her into joining an IIT or anything like that. The suicide note if you read the article again, the police officers words, not mine were "hinted that maybe her friends didn\'t know of her financial distress". How the fuck could media or someone reporting on this see this coming, sometimes shit happens, doesn\'t mean you start blaming one and all for it.'
"What does better judgement have to do with anything? When people are in pain and depression, suicide might  be the only relief in sight. How does the general public's offhand remarks about how stupid it is to kill oneself in any way makes sense? Do you think she didn't know that it'll be called foolish and naive on her part? Mental health isn't that cut and dried. \n\nLike you said, we haven't been in her shoes. "
'So according to you all people who have mental illnesses or even just suicidal ideation are stupid or weak? \n\nI mean the level of ignorance you show towards mental health issues in this day and age is worrying'
"Accepting suicide and embracing it under the pretext of its 'complexity' is also naive."
"I am not assuming anything, the girl's suicide letter pretty much says that!"
'It\'s not just simplification. It\'s downright ignorant. You sound like you know everyone\'s lives. You sound like you can empathise with every single person who has every considered or committed suicide and you\'ve arrived at the conclusion that suicide isn\'t viable, ever. Fucking think for one second, dude. \n\nYou don\'t have all the answers to life, as strange as that might sound. Your worldview isn\'t the gospel. It\'s not a "fact" nor is it "true". Your opinion, just like everyone else\'s, is just that: an opinion. Try not to sound like a know-it-all.'
"> mental health issues\n\nThen let's not blame the media? I suppose anyone I meet on the street could be suicidal. But if they do not share their troubles how can I know they are a ticking time bomb? And when they go off would it really be my fault? \n\nI made the comment in response to people in the thread blaming the media for her death. It was supposed to be positive news. Sure she may have had mental problems but is it really a crime to not walk around with a degree in psychology? \n\nWhat she did is stupid. Let's not pretend she did not have the world at her feet. I am going to call it stupid & not blame some mental illness or suicidal tendency when there was no indication of such beforehand. It's not a viral disease that kills you in 72 hours."
'At this point I got no clue what you want to say.'
"'Accepting' is a frivolous word to use for such a severe state of being.\n\nPeople don't accept it they succumb to it.Is it this tough to comprehend that pain can cross a certain threshold and become so unbearable they start wishing for death?\n\nHow is this even subjected to a debate I don't understand."
">the girl's suicide letter pretty much says that!\n\nIt's still an assumption..."
'It\'s harsh. I agree. I\'m just saying, it\'s not like people who commit suicide are deep philosophers who\'ve contemplated the human condition and come to some nihilist epiphany and are "courageous" enough to step out of the race. They\'re mostly idiots who\'ve made a shitty decision. Stop glorifying suicide.'
'Wat as in wat the fuck is he even saying'
"There's a simple way around that. The media could have *asked* her. But our media is like a dog with a bone. It doesn't have a single fucking clue what discretion means. Freedom of press trumps any expectation of privacy. Everything is fair game. Someone is accused of a crime? Plaster their faces and names over everything before an investigation even begins. A military document is leaked to a journalist? Better put it up on air just to be safe. The scoop beats any other concern. Who gives a fuck about the little girl being ashamed. She'll be old news in 48 hours. Oh she killed herself? Well I guess we can drag this story out over another few weeks then!"
"That's just an assumption....she was just a kid who was probably still immature and had a lot to offer the world. Alot of sucides seem like a stupid rash decision but it takes empathy to see that what seems stupid to people may have meant alot to the other person....takes a lot of emotional trauma before someone takes the extreme step."
'Ah,  my bad for not phrasing it properly. \n\n\nWhat I meant is that a person who is in a bad place mentally is dfferent from a person struggling in some other manner. A person plagued mentally doesnt have the mental fortitude to make proper judgements and get a objective perspective about his situation. \n\n\nYour comment and the upvotes it had recieved reflects how most of the people are ignorant about mental health issues. '
'>Is it this tough to comprehend that pain can cross a certain threshold and become so unbearable they start wishing for death?\n\nI already explained to you that I too am one of those unlucky\u200b enough to experience such pain. But taking the easy way out is not my remedy for it. And not talking about things only make it worse! '
">glorifying\n\nNot once did I ever portray suicide in a positive light. All I'm asking for is some fucking empathy. Try to understand why someone might have committed suicide instead of writing them off as idiots. The suicide statistics are made of people. Individuals with their own unique lives. If you think that you can describe every single suicide victim as an idiot, you're the idiotic one. Introduce some fucking nuance in your life. The world is not black and white. Just because I don't think people that kill themselves are fucking morons doesn't mean I'm glorifying suicide.\n\nEither way, it doesn't seem like I'm going to change your mind about this by continuing this exchange. I just hope the people reading this can see what I'm trying to say here, even if you may not."
'I do agree our media has a habit of taking a persons privacy for granted, but this seems hardly to be the case. It was a harmless article how a girl from financially weak background made good with what she had. This is hardly the case of privacy intrusion, no one saw this coming. I\'ll anyhow wait for the investigations to be done about the suicide before jumping to conclusions, just a reminder that the only "proof" that media was the reason for her suicide is the police officer claiming the suicide note seems to suggest that. There is a difference between suggestion and outrightly saying media or the sudden portrayal of her financial situation was responsible for this. '
"And aren't people here doing the very thing they do vehemently oppose, we are already here blaming the media without any proof, just on a mere hunch of a police officer who read her suicide note."
'You assume that your pain is comparable to the ones who commit suicide. \n\n\n'

You get swept away in the pressures of your life and make a drastic, escapist decision which solves nothing, and my leave your family with added problems.\n\nIf that's what he's saying, I agree with him.  It is not a very well thought out process. You become panicky and react in the worst way possible and make a terrible, permanent decision which will affect everyone around you. Awareness is needed to support people in such situations to stop them from making such a sad, stupid decision."
'There is a place for empathy and there is a place for frank discussion. I would never say in front of the girl\'s family that she made an idiotic decision. However, Reddit is a place for frank discussion. We have to stop pretending like she was brave, or some victim of a grand and systematic harassment.\n\n>If you think that you can describe every single suicide victim as an idiot, you\'re the idiotic one.\n\nOne idiotic decision does not an idiot make.\n\n>I just hope the people reading this can see what I\'m trying to say here, even if you may not.\n\nYou just want support for your "how dare you blame the victim instead of everybody else" point of view. So be it. It\'s definitely a touchy subject to talk ill of dead people, and completely inappropriate everywhere except on an anonymous internet forum, I\'ll agree with that.'
"You are the one who claimed to have experienced 'such pain'  of people who commit suicide. \n\nYou know what, your whole attitude reeks of arrogance and disdain towards people who are depressed or are struggling with other issues and have a bleak view of their lives, just because you were able to overcome your struggle. \n\nShame. "
"But here you are judging other people's pain, saying it's been worse for you than it must be for these other people."
'Let me put it so you understand, you said that even if you tried for a year you wont score as high as she did (your own comment). \n\nOn the lines that you are arguing, if she can do it so can you, there is no reason for you to say you cant and you dont even have an excuse not to. However this is just impossible, i hope we can agree on this. \n\nEssentially just the way it is impossible for you to score as much as she has ( you may not be intelligent enough, you may be paranoid by stress of exam and may be a thousand other reasons). Just like that her suicide should be comprehended, not understood not glorified and at the same time not shamed!'

'Take a bow! Sick reference bro!'
'Not sure what your family planning has got to do with river linking.'
'If you read correctly, the article first talks of his arrest by the govt for his protest against ONGC. Because of which he spent time in jail, during which time he wrote the book. \n\nWhich has led to the new sedition case. \n\n\nSo my dear, comprehend properly, before shooting your mouth. '

If he wrote the book in the jail, he shat in jail as well. So can he claim that he was slapped with sedition charges because he shat in the jail??\n\nAs well, did you read his book? If not then you should also stop shooting your mouth here. There are many people who are against the river linking, and it has been published, interviewed etc. I haven't seen any sedition charges.

I pay enough bribes to get government approvals and tenders floated in TN, I know what the present situation is like since Jayalaitha's death,  a gang of leeches have taken over the state and they know nothing about administration. The only thing they can see is $$$$ and promises of being given posts after the next general election  "
"I'm not sure if you were born this way or something unfortunate happened later."
"Well the article tries to link cause and effect. Says the government is 'spooked' and so has put sedition charges against him. Never clearly mentions on which issue the charges have been put. Never even quotes any piece of paper about the wording of the charges. Bloody one-sided article full of quotes from the guy. Maybe YOU should read the article before shooting your mouth off"

'> reportedly **for speaking**, and publishing a book against the sovereignty of state.\n\nSo he was speaking somewhere something, and publishing a book against the sovereignty of state, so he wrote something similar in the book as well, which he might have spoken before, which caused him jail.\n\nNow, government really does not care if you talk against a project, but if you start protesting somewhere and start writing conspiracy theories and try to incite violence or some problem, they you should be dealt with heavy hand. He was in jail for 42 days, Police is not stupid to keep someone in jail for such a long time just for protest, of course he must have done something serious. \n\nAnd these anti methane, greenpeace etc. idiots, get money from west and protest everything here in India. Nuclear power, river linking, dam building..they will collect villagers, put fear in their head like you will not get water etc. and start protesting.'

I found out that I was being shafted because a friend got a new connection from Airtel for Rs.1500 at 40Mbps. \n\nI moved to ACT broadband. I called to cancel the internet connection with Airtel and they immediately transferred me to "retention" who offered 40Mbps at 1300/m. That\'s almost 50% reduction. \n\nIf you want to move your prices down with the market while as a Airtel customer , you have to periodically call them and threaten them that you will cancel the connection lest they lower the cost. \n\nI will give it to them that there was absolutely no flaw in their network or service. But this dickery was a bit irritating. ACT broadband lowers the price of their own without you having to suffer information asymmetry and then suffer having to move to another carrier having learnt of new prices. '

"Yes, I haven't seen any confirmation/ads from RCom so that customers can port out in advance.\n\nPretty shitty company."
"Huh! Reliance Communications is shutting down it's cellular operations because they have no money.

'>“I was driving home from the Sector 8 market at about 12:15 am. I realized that a car was following me. It was a white SUV, and as I noticed it, it pulled up and started driving alongside my car. There were two guys inside the SUV and they seemed to really be enjoying harassing a lone girl in the middle of the night, judging by how often their car swerved just enough to scare me.\n\n>“By now I was mildly panicky, so I decided to turn right from the St Johns\' High School traffic lights towards Madhya Marg (a more crowded, seemingly safer road). I tried to turn right at the lights but the SUV blocked my way, forcing me to go straight into Sector 26. At the next turn, I tried to turn again, but this time they went a step further and blocked the road in front of my car. The guy in the passenger seat got out of the car and started walking towards me. I reversed as fast as I could and went straight and took the next right turn before they could catch up again.\n\n>“I used the time I gained to also call the cops at 100, and explain to them the situation and my exact location and where I was headed. The cop who answered my call intuitively sensed the urgency in my voice and promised me that help would be along very soon. I hung up and reached the main road. I didn’t see the SUV for about 15 seconds, so I hoped that they\'d seen me calling the cops and disappeared. I was wrong. I was now on a straight road for about 5-6 km (Madhya Marg) and that entire time, the SUV stayed alongside my car, trying to bully me into stopping every 10-15 seconds. I was in a full-blown panic by now because they would keep trying to block me, and I somehow manoeuvred my way out and kept moving.\n\n>“My hands shaking, my back spasming from fear, half in tears, half bewildered, because I didn\'t know if I\'d make it home tonight. Who knew when, or if, the cops would show up? This time they meant business because they left me absolutely no space to move or escape, and the passenger jumped out of the car and moved towards mine. I don\'t know how, but I reversed my car and moved to the right where there was space all this while constantly honking so the few vehicles around would know something was wrong. At this point, the guy reached my car, banged loudly on my window and tried to open the door. Just as he did this, I saw a PCR pull up at the lights, quite possibly in response to my call. They heard me honking and saw the SUV swerving left and right in an attempt to block me, and a couple of cops ran out towards the SUV, nabbing it just in time because they were blocked by traffic.’’\n\nGirl\'s full facebook post copy-pasted.\n\nI wonder why police have not charged the boys with kidnapping?

Two men - one of them the son of Haryana BJP\nchief - had allegedly been following her in their white Tata Safari SUV. They\nsoon pulled up alongside her car, swerving their SUV "just enough to scare me\nthat it might hit me". Twice, they allegedly blocked her way, forcing her to\nstop. She managed to escape on both occasions. As she called the police, she\ncontinued racing through the streets, desperately waiting for help to arrive.\n\n"My hands shaking, my back spasming from fear, half in tears, half bewildered,\nbecause I didn\'t know if I\'d make it home tonight. Who knew when, or if, the\ncops would show up," the woman, the daughter of a senior Haryana bureaucrat,\nwrote in a Facebook post, recounting her ordeal.\n\nThe cops did eventually rescue the woman, and\n\ncaught the two men\n\n.\n\nOne of them is Vikas Barala, son of Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala. The\nother is his friend, Ashish. Both were arrested for stalking and drunk\ndriving, and are were later released on bail.\n\nThe woman on a Facebook post said she could have been raped and killed\n\n"I\'m lucky, it seems, to not be the daughter of a common man, because what\nchance would they have against such VIPs? I\'m also lucky, because I\'m not\nlying raped and murdered in a ditch somewhere," the woman said in the post,\npointing that the two men she accused of tormenting her "are from influential\nfamilies with political connections".\n\nOn being questioned why charges of kidnapping were not pressed against the\naccused, a senior Chandigarh police officer Satish Kumar said, "When we\nreceived the original copy of the girl\'s statement, we found that there was no\nmention that any attempt was made to abduct her. The girl did not mention\nabout her abduction. Therefore, we did not find possibility of adding these\nsections."\n\nAs the Opposition launched a blistering attack on the ruling BJP, demanding\nthe removal of Subhash Barala as state party chief, Haryana Chief Minister\nManohar Lal Khatter said, "This issue is not of Subhash Barala.

"uuu uuu" he cried. Unable to see his condition, Netaji and Akhilesh immediately sent an army of IAS officers on an errand to bring Lamborghini car.\n\n> And least the car got there, but how would little Prateek ride it anywhere?

"Let's ask simple questions - What problem bullet train will solve? \n\n1. Will it make travel fast?\n\n2. Will it make travel cheap?\n\n3. Will it make travel safer?\n\nAnswer to first question is Air travel. Mumbai -Ahmedabad is 1hour travel with cost of 1,500 Rs.\n\nLet's say 10 years down the line there is bullet railway line between Delhi- Mumbai. Will it reduce the travel time than existing 2.5 hours and cheaper than Rs3,000? I guess not. So what is the point? \n\nBullet trains worked in Japan/Europe 'coz they are small country. Even US doesn't have one. \n\nRailways are majorly used for Freight and cheap travel by people who can't afford air fare. Sadly bullet train will not cater any of these two (not without heavy subsidy). It will cater to people who can already afford air fare. And I can't think of a reason why would anyone choose a slower transportation (bullet train) over faster (airplane)?\n\nAs for 3rd one? It is corridor of few hundred kilometres in country of lakhs of kilometre of network. Maybe you can answer, how will that one corridor improve the rest of network?"

Bullet trains is atleast a utility. '
'What. The. Fuck. \n\nThe railway ministry knew about this since 2015 AT LEAST. Remove your orange tints for once!'
"> Here the problem is poor infrastructure.\n\nYes. What is cheaper and more resourceful - improving existing infrastructure or building totally new infrastructure while allowing the existing ones to crumble?\n\nWhat is smarter - spend thousands of crores of Rupees on ONE high speed rail or upgrading the speed of 1000's of train marginally with the same money?\n\nRailways is already running on a loss - you don't pour more water in a bucket with a hole until you make an attempt to fix the hole (my mallu *chaiwallah* bakery guy made this comment by the way ...)."

As someone else pointed out, proposal for another FoB was with railways for over an year. They cite lack of resources for delay in project.

'> Sanctity of military ranks and placing them above all services is not a creation of rank conscious Indian military but a convention that has become a law across all nations. The Lord Jesus Christ Himself recognized that power of Pontius Pilate “which has been given from above” (Jn. 19:11): the power of the sword, to kill and to defend a state from its enemies rests with the soldiers. The legislation, government, judiciary and the farmers can function if the state is defended by powerful armies. That is why the profession of arms was considered the most valued profession by almost every scripture- Gita, Bible and Quran; and a soldier was placed at highest pedestal in a state and society.\n\n>Not many people know that the military ranks have been sanctified by tens of names of martyrs and hundreds of nameless martyrs. These ranks have not been picked up at random but from those who laid down their lives in defending their respective nations. Idea was that every time you address a solider by his rank you actually honour the martyr by remembering him. The respect given to the profession of arms was such that no one could become a king or shepherd of a church without serving in the military.  The importance of serving in the military was so significant that those who refused to serve in the military could never become part of the body of the Church and member of the court of the king. Thus the profession of the arms was and will continue to remain above all other professions in spite of the fact that there has been constant conspiracy to erode it. Even today the British Crown Prince is required to serve in the military.\n\n>A court official no matter how high he was not given the power to kill but it was and is vested with the soldiers. In the battlefield a soldier could kill, injure or even spare the life of an enemy and the authority rests with the soldier to decide as per his conscience. All other government functionaries can be prosecuted for killing another human. Supremacy in status was accorded to military personnel not only in Hindu scriptures but across all religions, faith and empires from Europe to Asia.\n\nhttp://www.claws.in/1813/the-sanctity-of-the-military-ranks-beyond-equivalence-narender-kumar.html'

The law enforcement forces have adopted many measures and SOS alert apps, and free helpline are quite essential in this process. But do these helplines work and actually provide the necessary help on time if a distress call is made?\n\nA girl from Mumbai has shared her harrowing experience online of calling on one such helpline number in the time of distress. 22-year-old student Pooja Nair was travelling by Mumbai Local one afternoon when she faced a rather humiliating situation. Travelling in the ladies compartment with a friend she noticed a man was waving at a co-passenger from the next compartment through the rods, that separates the coaches.\n\nShe mistakenly looked up from her phone and made eye contact with the man, and heard him yelling abuses at her. She was not scared and decided to keep staring at him in hope that he would stop glaring and abusing. But the man was not deterred, in fact, he crossed the line by opening his pant’s zip, pulled out his penis and started masturbating looking at her. “Meanwhile, he puts his hand down, whips out his penis and grins at me, he starts masturbating,” she wrote in her post.\n\nShe asked help from a fellow passenger to call the women helpline to report the incident, but what happened next left her in dismay. “I told the person on the line all the details. The train was just approaching Kandivli. Which compartment, what time. All of it. Then I told him that this person had also called us what he did. And then the person on the helpline laughed.”\n\nShe was stunned at the person on the helpline could laugh at the occurrence and when asked for help, he disconnected the call.\n\nAccording to her post, the man who was masturbating got down at the next station and even threatened her that he would rape her. He even tried to board onto the ladies compartment but other women in the coach yelled, so he backed off.\n\nRead her full post here\n\nHer post has gained a lot of attention online and many have questioned what was the need for such helpline if they did not understand the severity of such incidents. Many also shared their own experiences. Here’s what other Facebook users had to say:\n\nAs the post went viral, the Western Railway now has promised to look into the matter. Deputy Commissioner of Police Purushottam Karad told the Times of India, “We have to check which helpline the woman commuter made the call to. There are two helpline numbers — one is railway police and the other is Railway Protection Force (RPF). We will talk to the woman.”\n\nFor all the latest Trending News, download Indian Express App\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"I am slightly confused and finding the story incredulous. \n\nThere were definitely many women in the women's compartment - so it is probably not a late night train. The men's compartment are generally more crowded than the women's compartment - even if it were not the case, there should be a few men present. Given the premium for seating in a local train, quite a few people would have been sitting around the guy when he started masturbating. Shit like this will get you thrashed in local trains.\n\nAlso, it is difficult to see below chest/head level between coaches due to partition fence in the older generation coaches. Maybe the coaches introduced don't have the same partition system."
"Those people (like culprit) actually bring disgrace to our nation by performing such shameful acts it's more of a mental illness that incite confidence in those culprits and left such innocent people to suffer also it's too ignorant of the society to not take proper measures to curb out such problems rather they take it such lightly and let it go away by mocking\u200b it and should be sued, it's more of a bravery that the girl despite of those warnings remained adamant and managed to catch a glimpse of him to provide a valid proof of it, I hope proper measures should be taken against this wrongdoing or criminality."

The government, their friends and apparently even their families are not on their side and will not protect them. Vigilantism seems like the only option until this violence is not tolerated anymore.

And which is exactly why they need to be put in prisons."
"They are crazy. Because they actually think that rape is a normal and acceptable thing to do to someone you don't like. In fact, rape, in a lot of ways, is worse than murder and should have harsher punishments because it kills a part of the victim forever and they are never the same, even if they survive and are able to successfully move on.  \n\nBut it doesn't mean the rapist doesn't know what they're doing is wrong. They're just arrogant enough to believe they can get away with it. "

Indian women are so smart and industrious that they simply don't need men the way they've been groomed to believe they do. And if women's sexuality, rights and concerns aren't being taken seriously in the country they live in, it's NOT WORTH HER FUCKING TIME to stay there. I wish there was an active association that helped women escape situations where they could be trapped into marriages, punished for being raped and killed for stating an opinion. It's time for women to give a collective middle finger to historical misogyny. "

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Chhattisgarh minister’s wife buys state forest land to build a resort, his dept says we can do nothing** \n\n ______ \nThe entrance of the resort. The entrance of the resort.\n\nRaising questions of propriety and conflict of interest, Sarita Agrawal, wife of Chhattisgarh Minister and BJP leader Brijmohan Agrawal, acquired 4.12 hectares of forest land which was owned by the government and is now, along with her son, building a resort on it. The purchase, in September 2009, was red-flagged by several officials of the Raman Singh government, as recently as June 30 this year, but her husband’s Ministry put down in writing that “it’s not possible to take any action in the matter,” an investigation by The Indian Express has revealed.\n\nBrijmohan Agrawal has been MLA of Raipur South since 1990 and is currently Minister for Agriculture, Water Resources and Religious Trusts and Endowments. When his wife bought the land, he was Minister for School Education, Public Works Department, Parliamentary Affairs, Tourism and Culture.\n\nThe resort, called Shyam Vatika, is being developed near Sirpur in the Mahasamund district of Chhattisgarh, a site with several Buddhist excavations over the years. Significantly, Agrawal’s Ministry has identified this region as a potential tourist destination.\n\nNot just the wife, his son, too, is involved with the project. Two companies, Aditya Srijan Private Limited and Purbasa Vanijya Private Limited, have acquired land for the same project. Registrar of Companies records show that the former company has both Sarita Agrawal and her son Abhishek Agrawal as directors while Purbasa Vanijya has Abhishek Agrawal as one of its directors.\n\nRecords show that on March 2, 1994, along with five other farmers of Jhalki village, one Vishnu Ram Sahu gave these 4.12 hectares to the Water Resources Department as part of “daanpatra”, a system where private individuals give their lands to the government for public good as “daan”.\n\nRead | ‘Kuch dalal aaye the… later, I found that mantriji bought the land’ Click Here\n\nAlmost immediately, this plot, as part of a total of 61.729 hectares, was handed over to the Forest Department, in lieu of land submerged by a minor irrigation project. Records show that the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests gave preliminary clearance to this transfer on May 2, 1994. Nine years later, Rs 22.90 lakh was spent on afforestation of this land, as well as building “cattle protection trenches.” The Union Ministry then gave final clearance to the transfer of land on December 17, 2003.\n\nHome of Vishnu Sahu who donated his land to govt and then sold it. Home of Vishnu Sahu who donated his land to govt and then sold it.\n\nLand registry records accessed by The Indian Express show that Sarita Agrawal bought three “khasras” — 1.38, 1.37 and 1.37 hectares — totalling 4.12 hectares on September 12, 2009 for Rs 5,30,600.\n\nIncidentally, this 4.12 hectares finds mention in the 2013 election affidavit of Brijmohan Agrawal with the affidavit listing the land as registered to his wife Records investigated by The Indian Express show that different government agencies — office of the Collector, Mahasamund; Commissioner, Raipur; Forest and Water Resources departments — all arrived at the same conclusion: that this was land meant to be with the government but because of “laxity in records,” it remained in Vishnu Ram’s name who then sold it to the Minister’s wife.\n\nThe plot first came under the Government’s scanner in March 2015 when one Lalit Chandranahu of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangh of Mahasamund district wrote to Mahasamund Collector Umesh Kumar Agrawal and the then Raipur Commissioner Ashok Agarwal alleging that while the plot was transferred to the government, revenue records did not show this.\n\nIn August 2016, Chandranahu sent a second complaint that the land had been bought by Sarita Agrawal.\n\nBased on this complaint, the Collector and the Commissioner, now Brijesh Mishra, asked the Forest and Water Departments to provide records of the plot’s ownership Barely four months later, another complaint dated December 2, 2016, was sent to the Prime Minister’s Office by a whistleblower that mentions the acquisition of this forest land.\n\nIt said: “Respected Modiji, look at the irony, some influential people have now usurped government land in their name, This has been done in a complete violation of all norms and government directions, because as you know, there is a set procedure for distribution of government land and without the state Cabinet’s approval this cannot be distributed.”\n\nThis letter was forwarded by the PMO to Chhattisgarh Chief Secretary Vivek Dhand on December 26 asking for the petitioner’s identity to be kept confidential. Dhand forwarded the letter to the Mahasamund Collector asking for an enquiry on January 13, 2017.\n\nOn March 16, 2017, the Collector responded to the Chief Secretary, noting that that land had been given to the Forest Department but since there was “laxity” in changing the name in the revenue records, it remained in the name of the original owner Vishnu Ram who sold it to Sarita Agrawal.\n\nBut even as every single government agency has reiterated that land that was sold was forest land, each passes the buck. In a letter on April 13 this year, Commissioner Raipur Brijesh Mishra wrote to the Collector to say that action should now be taken through the Forest, Revenue and Water Resources Departments.\n\nFor its part, the Forest Department has written two letters since November 2016, asking the Water Resources Department to make a change in the revenue records.\n\nBut Brij Mohan Agrawal serves as Water Resources Minister and in a letter to the Collector on November 22, 2016, the Mahasamund Water Resources department said that while it had been considered that the 4.12 hectares was forest land, it was found after an investigation into Lalit Chandranahu’s complaint that it had been sold in the name of Sarita Agrawal. “Yah baat tab saamne aayi jab Shri Lalit Chandranahu vanmandaladhikari mahasamund se shikayat ki gayi aur unke dwaara jaanch mein paya gaya ki bhumi khasra no. 117, naya 802/1,802/2, 802/3 ke roop mein daankarta dwaara Shrimati Sarita Agrawal pati Shri B.M Agrawal ke naam se vikraya kar di gayi hai. Atah, is par vibhag dwara aaj dinank ko kisi bhi prakar ki karvahi kiya jaana sambhav nahi hai (This matter came to the fore when Shri Lalit Chandranahu complained to the forest officer Mahasamund and it was found after an enquiry that the land had been sold to Sarita Agrawal, wife of BM Agrawal. Therefore, it is not possible to take any action on this day),” the letter said.\n\nOn June 30 this year, the Collector again wrote to the Forest and Water Resources departments asking what action had been taken as a report also had to be sent to Chhattisgarh’s Economic Offences Wing and the Anti-Corruption Bureau.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'~~At least one Andhra person, that I know of, has gotten a Nobel Prize, but he did his award winning work in America.~~\n\nEDIT: My bad folks, he did not win a Nobel. \n\n>Yellapragada Subbarow (12 January 1895 – 8 August 1948) was an Indian biochemist who discovered the function of adenosine triphosphate as an energy source in the cell, and developed methotrexate for the treatment of cancer. Most of his career was spent in the United States. Despite his isolation of ATP, Subbarow was denied tenure at Harvard[1][2] though he would lead some of America\'s most important medical research during World War II. Subbarow died in the United States.[3] Subbarow is also credited with the first synthesis of the chemical compounds folic acid and methotrexate.\n\n>Subbarow\'s colleague, George Hitchings said, "Some of the nucleotides isolated by Subbarow had to be rediscovered years later by other workers because Fiske, apparently out of jealousy, did not let Subbarow\'s contributions see the light of the day."[4] A fungus genus was named Subbaromyces in his honor.[5][6] Writing in the April 1950 issue of Argosy, Doron K. Antrim observed,[7] "You\'ve probably never heard of Dr. Yellapragada Subbarow. Yet because he lived you may be alive and are well today. Because he lived you may live longer."[8]\n\n>After his work on folic acid and with considerable input from Dr. Sidney Farber, he developed the important anti-cancer drug methotrexate - one of the very first cancer chemotherapy agents and still in widespread clinical use.[10][11][11][12] Subbarow also discovered the basis for hetrazan which was used by the World health Organization against filariasis.[13] Under Subbarow, Benjamin Duggar made his discovery of the world\'s first tetracycline antibiotic, aureomycin, in 1945. \n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellapragada_Subbarow\n\nHis Wikipedia article is sadly a tad sparse for the amount of impact his work has had on this world.

'>Whether it was intuition, inside information or general practice regarding timely publication, Meyerhof pushed Lohmann to submit his data. It appeared in early August of 1929 in the journal Naturwissenschaften. Although Fiske and SubbaRow had almost certainly simultaneously purified salts of ATP at Harvard University, through an ill-fated decision, they chose not to publish their own results. In late August, Lohmann presented the discovery of ATP at the International Physiology Conference in Boston. Fiske, who attended the lecture, must have sensed his mistake, because he immediately approached Lohmann after the talk and a low-key argument broke out, as witnessed by Severo Ochoa. Fiske and SubbaRow quickly arranged to give an informal talk at the end of the conference and rushed to publish their own data in October. It was too late, however.

(Photo: PTI)\n\nOver a month after Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala’s son Vikas Barala was arrested for stalking Varnika Kundu, daughter of a senior Haryana-cadre IAS officer VS Kundu, the state government on Tuesday transferred the bureaucrat. Kundu, who was looking after state’s Tourism Department, has been posted as Additional Chief Secretary, Science and Technology Department. He will keep looking after State University of Performing and Visual Arts, Rohtak, as its Vice-Chancellor.\n\nWhen contacted by The Indian Express, Kundu said, “It’s up to the government where it deputes me keeping in view my capabilities. I don’t have any problem in it. I never tried to stop my transfer order.” Notably, the development came hours after a Chandigarh court dismissed bail application of Vikash Barala on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, in the transfer order, the government has not mentioned any reason for Kundu’s new posting. Among other IAS officers transferred in Haryana, Vijai Vardhan has been posted as Additional Chief Secretary, Tourism Department, Jyoti Arora as Principal Secretary, Higher Education Department, and Ashok Kumar Meena as Director, Development and Panchayats Department.

'Sometimes some IAS officers don\'t work as well as they should at a particular post, so they are transferred somewhere where they don\'t really have a say in anything important. Otherwise, IAS officers who actually do very well are transferred because sometimes actually doing your job well interferes in the business (legal or otherwise) of people who are in power (legislative) or have connections to people in power. Lastly, as is suggested in this post, simple vindictiveness will lead to the transfer. Btw, all this is besides the routine transfers, but are masked as routine.\nThe punishment being, a post which has no actual work (boring and infuriating to many who are pretty well learned and joined the job to "make a difference"), and no power.'

The Collegium system is a result of twisted interpretation of the Constitution bordering on abuse.\n\n>  But thankfully SC struck it down to maintain the independence of judiciary.\n\nIndependence doesn't mean unaccountability. The SC is notorious for shirking away when when it comes to its own transparency. It was more than happy to pass orders for politicians to disclose their assets, but appeared before the Delhi HC to oppose a similar order by the CIC for SC judges. They also turn a blind eye to corruption in higher judiciary. Worst you get is a transfer to Sikkim HC, as if Sikkim isn't a part of India. If you were very unlucky, you'd be made to retire with full benefits and pension.\n\nThe Collegium system has to go.

'I saw a Patanjali ad on a makeup line.\n\nSo. Cringe. Worthy.\n\nShame at the level of shamefulness that is displayed at  someone (in the ad atleast) having one fucking pimple.\n\nThe ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBh7VzLVh1U'
'I actually like a bunch of Patanjali products but might boycott them on the back of shit like this.'
'Who is the fellow on the left with the buck teeth? He looks retarded. Is that the face of someone whom you want to advertise your products with?'
'The ad is very misleading.\n\nOil for human consumption is purified in two ways: \n\n- Mechanically. This means it is essentially **filtered**. Sometime is it is filtered twice and then the oil is called **double filtered**. For example, cold-pressed olive oil is filtered. \n\n- Chemically. This means some chemicals are added to the raw oil. These chemicals bind with the impurities in the oil. When the chemicals are then removed, the impurities are also removed and the oil becomes purer. This is called **refined** oil. (At one time, manufacturers used to advertise "double-refined" oil -- which makes no sense -- and the govt put a stop to this sort of advertising.)\n\nSo either you have **filtered** oil or you have **refined** oil. There is no such thing as as "physically refined" oil as claimed by Patanjali.\n\nAs a rule I don\'t buy Patanjali products -- however good their products may be -- just because they try to fool the consumer at every opportunity.'
'IMHO all the advertisement are based on manipulating customers mind so as to use their product. But it is upto masses to choose wisely what is right or wrong for them.'
'Stop playing the patriotic card here and sell your product on merit. Disgusting ! '
'Yes, says the company that writes its advertisements in the very same dumb Germanic pidgin language that USA, UK and (for foreign diplomacy and business) Europe and China use.'
"Good. Nationalists dumb enough to buy patanjali should fall sick and die by gomutra and ayurveda. Good for India's population."
"Fuck you. You can't stop me from using canola and olive oil."
"You are all spiteful little assholes.\nPissed at Patanjali because of their advertising?\n\n\n\nBecause the other ones are very honourable never exaggerate or make  bullshit claims and resort to  false advertising?\n\n\n\nIt's the most obvious play to market their product as Indian and try to invoke 'patriotism' among people.\nSince when has advertising been anything but fooling the people into getting their products?\n"
"The quality of Patanjali products are good. They have pointed out many problems with mass produced FMCG goods, like addition of mineral oils in hairoils.  Their advertising appealing to patriotism, and hyperbole about competitor's products causing cancer are irritating. "
'**Playstore?** How dare you... such blasphemy \n\nBaba will launch his own OS. All foreign OS will be banned and Indians will have to only use Patanjali OS, do your patriotic duties each time to login. '
'As Katju said 90% of Indians are stupid. '
"And why? Or do you believe that by virute of it being videshi, Unilever (that has poisoned 1000's in Kodaikanal and taken no responsibility) or Nestle (that has done so many evil things that I can't even choose one) offer better quality?\n\n"
"You think he is the first one to have attempted this?\nThe rise of multinational companies had a lot to do with failure of Indian ones.\n\n\nMajority of the public is content with Patanjali's standards, no company thrives on  'patriotism' angle if the public discards their products ."
'Ftfy\n\nBe patriotic. Buy shit'
"India is largest importer of edible oil? Doesn't that help Baba's argument?"
'yes. by squeezing groundnuts between his kulcha-approved ass cheeks. '
'Its a legit way of refining crude oil. Nothing wrong there. '
"Mr/Mrs/Miss Goldpisser, no one is pissed because of the claims. People are pissed because the product here is not even advetised. The thing here advertised is 'nationalism' and 'patriotism' which are not even a tangible thing. Mr Ramdev is not someone, for which I or somebody else has to proove their love for the nation. \nPeople are pissed because Ramdev is just a little bitch who sells substandard products on the name of patriotism.\nThis is not the thing any other companies have done, except jio, which is itself controversial. This is something that should not happen in a sane, democratic country."
'but its really hard to find an independent consensual prostitute. '
'\n\n\n\nAbe chutiye log, article padh toh liya karo pehle. Shitty clickbait and shitter reporting by Time of India\n\n> AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday ruled that a criminal case is not maintainable against "sex workers engaged in prostitution of their own volition, and not due to any inducement, force or coercion".\n\n> The court was interpreting provisions of Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code which refer to physical or sexual exploitation and slavery which were made more stringent by the Centre after the Nirbhaya gangrape case. Even a customer of a sex worker is covered under the definition of \'offender\' in this section as far as prostitution is concerned.\n\n> Justice J B Pardiwala referred to an exhaustive debate that took place before Justice J S Verma Commission, who made recommendations for amendment in legislation after the Nirbhaya case. The court was hearing a quashing petition of Vinod Patel, who allegedly visited a brothel in Surat on January 3. He was nabbed along with five others in a police raid. Patel was booked under provisions of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act as well as under section 370 of the IPC.\n\n> Patel moved the HC saying that he was not caught in the company of any sex worker or victim but was waiting for his turn. Hence, he was not an offender indulging in exploitation of a person in flesh trade against the victim\'s will.\n\n> After hearing the case, the HC quashed charges under Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act against Patel by stating that they are not maintainable because he was not part of the racket which ran prostitution and earned by exploiting sex workers. However, the court refused to quash charges of section 370 of the IPC and said the incident was subject to probe, which would prove whether he had already paid the amount and that he should fall in the category of the customer, who too is liable to be punished.'
'Its hight time to recognise it as a profession and regulate and monitor it not to brush it aside saying it doesnot exist.\nWe all know it exist every where, every state and they are the most vulnerable species anyone can abuse them and they have nothing what so ever in name of protection and citizen rights\nLike Rera we need Pera Too!'
'Murder is not a crime if the victim was not forced.'
"Meh. This is India. People would go to the illegal prostitution places because they cost 1 re less and didn't force you to wear condoms. "
'But there are still a lot of them out there. I know for sure that there are a lot of young people in Delhi from very decent backgrounds doing this for money, both male and females. When I was in college a friend of mine used to volunteer for an NGO that helped youngsters who struggled with drug addiction. A lot of times these young people financed their addiction by prostitution, makes sense because students are mostly broke. He said that if its a young guy and a drug addict their source is either prostitution or trading the drugs they consume. Real shady stuff man, its actually sad, and is a big problem from what I hear.'
"I think it's poor wording - they'll prosecute the pimps. "
"good for prostitutes they don't have to deal with assholes who don't use protection and have high chance of being infected already"
"I wouldn't put it past the court to pass a judgement with imprecise wording that is later misrepresented in another trial by our qaabil dost.\n\nI think they could just have said no criminal cases would be maintainable against sex workers - whether forced or voluntary - but they would be maintainable against pimps and customers (under the existing law wherein prostitution is unlawful)."
"Even prostitution with ones consent is legal in India. There's absolutely no need to harrass couples and it's a crime. "
'no grill :('
"The point is that, because there will be a market for illegal prostitution anyways, it'll still remain even with legal prostitution. That's a big fucking problem.\n\nAnyway, this is a purely hypothetical question because no major politician will ever talk about prostitution. Unless they're insulting some rival politician."
'the one fucking her has higher chances of getting infected with HIv  instead of the opposite '
'one does not imply other. While murder is a crime, self defense is not. '
'Absolutely wrong. Soliciting in public place like a residential street is illegal however you can advertise on the internet and there is no law barring that.\n\nIndian law does not refer to practice of selling sexual services as prostitution.'
'Soliciting in public place is illegal. If you have a website that not every one can access then imo it should be legal'
'If you don\'t revert your transaction and end-up committing person to Islam, you are going to be in such trouble beta.\nI would suggest step 4.5 called "Ghar wapsi" and then profit.\nBrilliant idea to game the system. All the best.'
">Indian law does not refer to practice of selling sexual services as prostitution.\n\nNo, the law seems to suggest that you can pay for sexual services, rest all relating to advertisement would fall under soliciting and hence illegal I think. Can you point out the specific points in the law that makes you think that this might be a loophole, how is an internet advertisement not a sales pitch and wouldn't it be considered soliciting?"
"Wouldn't soliciting on a site that is accessible to public by default become soliciting in public? Often times language used in law has wider and evolving definition, there was no internet when the law was written. Nowadays, however, websites are public places and you would have a hard time wining a case with that argument. \n\nTo condense the current situation at hand what I feel the law essentially is saying is that you can take it in private and indulge in prostitution, but if the authorities have the means to find out what you do then you are going to get in trouble. "
'Long-term socho beta\n\nEdit: Also holy shit, so the wife is not receiving a service as well? Dadaji aap ko internet kisne sikhaya?'
'> Also holy shit, so the wife is not receiving a service as well?\n\nYou are missing the point, wife is the only one paying the dowry,  isn\'t she? So if both receive the "service", then why does only one person pays? That was the point and was made as a joke. '

We need not encourage them. They should be shut” said the minister.\n\nHe could have just talked about drugs, but no he had to go into culture and turn into a genuine issue into "culture" issue.

'But its okay to rape and murder white foreigners.'

"FUCK AIRTEL FUCK AIRTEL FUCK AIRTEL\n\nSorry, had to get that out of my system.\n\nI hate this company so goddamn much. Changed my house and asked them to shift the connection.

For a connection that isn't even active.\n\n"
"Voda do something similar.\n\nFor ₹497 you get 4gb 3g and 4gb 4g data. I exhausted my 3g data limit and voda zeroed my balance after it, even though I had 4gb 4g data left. This happened because I use 3g as a preferred network to save battery.\n\nNow that I am aware of this, I use it more conveniently but it isn't a consumer friendly business model."
'This is fucking outrageous! And I thought their T.V. ads were the worst of their "creativity". Please file a complaint with the consumer court, and don\'t listen to the idiots that say it\'s just rs.157, it\'s not about money, it\'s about consumer rights in India, and fraudulent advertising. \n\n\nGood luck.'
"I sympathize with you.\n\nBut, there isn't anything that you can do. While your loss is marginal it's their bread and butter. They have more money, and better lawyers and if it comes to it they can always bribe a judge. Too much of pain in the ass and they bribe politicians (regulatory capture) and come after things dear to you (read net neutrality). \n\nThis is how Chortel makes it's money. Grin and bear it. Sorry."
"Someone I know also got scammed.\n\n*Get a 3G/4G net pack from Airtel. Whenever you won't get 3G or 4G network, Airtel will charge you separately from your main account because you just used their 'paid' 2G service. Today I became a victim of this fraud even though the preferred network type in my phone was set to 3G.\nI've heard that they do the same for pure 4G data packs in which they charge you for 3G usage wherever 4G isn't available.*\n\nTo compete with Jio, Airtel has really gone done to a new low! This shit needs to end right. Force free services by them for a day and they'll know. "
"What irritates me even more is when Airtel's super annoying voice lady keeps advertising their data plans when I am making a call. When I pick someone to call rather than just dialing the number this bitch slowly talks about the data plan for 20 seconds before calling the person. \n\nAnyway to stop this from happening? \n\n"
'Hello Friend,\n\nNice of you to educate us all. But before you go to a Consumer court, make sure you have all the credible documentation to prove that you have been cheated by your service provider and they have been resorting to anti-consumer practices. \n\nBut even before this, you also need to show the court that you have exhausted all means of communicating your grievances to your service provider and that your service provider had turned a deaf ear even after your repeated complaints.

'Please dont do this.\n\nIf you have the time pursue the court case. The amount is small to you, but false advertisement is not aimed at you. The courts will put a much larger penalty on chortel. '

"Because I don't want anything to do with Reliance. Its the principle of the thing. Don't like them as a company, don't want to deal with them.

At least Airtel was fairly tech savvy, they let you pick and choose what you wanted. You don't have to deal with the customer service. \n\nOn the post paid side, Airtel is amazing... but you get what you pay for I suppose."
'What a ridiculous post. Way to dishearten people. \n\nIt is not entirely impossible that the court gives the consumer some reprieve and allows compensation to go through. Unless the guy actually goes ahead and gives himself a chance, nothing can be said for sure. '
"I know what you mean, but its my money and I don't like being made a fool of. "
'What if you only get 2G or 3G on 4G handset? What if you are on 2G/3G only handset? Why should those pay extra for 4G? The pricing model is correct. \n\nAlso, Airtel is a good for competition. If only Jio option remains, we are going to get really fucked up on prices front. \n\nJust saying...'

Good education and healthcare is of utmost importance.\n\nThat said, they really need to massively overhaul the teaching staff and the way they are hired. In my day, we used to go to the houses of particular "famous" teachers from govt schools who were well-known for preparing you to pass the Board Exams. Not really teach you science in a proper way. That\'s really the shittiest way to do education.'
'Nice. Better education is always good.\n\nIn my days a "model school" was just another shitty education institution with an English-sounding name...to make it look \'educated\'...because apparently all educated people have to be Ingalish Ispiking Anglophiles Briton-huggers right? Inside it, everything else was as shitty as any other school in India. After a decade, anything named "model school" in my city provoked a cringe reaction from everyone.\n\nI hope this "model" school doesn\'t turn out to be one of those again.'

If they aren't tilting away pointlessly at the windmills, the Kashmiris have no reason to do so either.    \n                       \nFuck, one of my grandmother's uncles died in the '71 War, liberating the same country that had kicked his family out.  Meanwhile Kashmiris will cry themselves hoarse over terrorists attacking cops getting killed. "
'I am from the same state. Lived there for a long long time, more than your age most likely. Unfortunately for your loud rhetoric challenge, I can answer yes to all of your dumb questions.\n\nKashmiris in this case refer to Muslim kashmiris who first picked up guns, drove out non-muslims and when armed terrorism failed, now are doing all this drama. Details are all in my first post. Read it again, slowly.'
'If it is a lot more difficult, it is also more important problem, no?\n\nAnd of course we can do shit about it. At this stage, it is mainly a problem of propaganda. Most Indians are against the idea of giving independence to Kashmir purely because they have grown up with propaganda about Kashmir being integral part of India, "doodh mangoge kheer denge, kashmir mangoge cheer denge" etc etc. Just start telling people you know that giving Kashmir independence is an acceptable solution to the Kashmir problem. Fight the propaganda and make the Kashmir problem easier to solve at least for future generations.'
'You have a fair point. \n\nBut this is the situation in Kashmir since 1970\'s. Politicians are responsible for this. But what have we done to deserve this?\n\nOkay don\'t do mass tweets(not that I asked anyone to do that). Hell don\'t even help us. We made a mistake. Let us suffer. \n\nBut if someone asks you,"Hey you are a educated man. Tell me something. Should I join NIT Srinagar?"  Just tell him No. Will you?  That is the least you can do. \n\nThank you for your time. Have a nice day. '

"Yes I am a student there. \n\nWell whenever there is a strike then the college remains off that day. Mainly because day scholars and teachers who stay outside the college can't come.  \n\nI don't know about 2010 exactly. There was major protest in Kashmir then too. I think the college was shut during that time too. \n\nAlso, we can't roam around Srinagar freely. Nobody knows when they might throw a petrol bomb or take out guns and attack security forces. The situation is pretty bad. It's like a fucking war zone. And they expect us to go there and study. It's tough for even Army. How the hell are we supposed to survive there??"
'And we have Amit Shah shouting "Disrespect the nation and you won\'t be forgiven" and some such.\n\nEdit : I suppose no one got it. They were beaten up for flying the tricolor. They were beaten up for showing their support to India. \n\nWe have police rounding up people for questioning the government. And this is nothing to the BJP?'
"Arre screw the propaganda bit (on which I agree with you), freedom for Kashmir is impossible just because of the god-level nightmare it will become, having a desperately poor, Islamic-radicalized hotzone just on top of us. It will 100% become a hotbed of some offshoot of Taliban/ISIS. You think all the brainwashed militants out there will just retire in peace if they get independence? Besides the obvious mega PR disaster, it will just create new, bigger problems for us.\n\nI hate to say this, because it's no fault of the Kashmiris, but they're fucked without a chance of recovery unless either Pakistan stops being a fucktard and actually stops breeding terrorism (for their own good, they'd never do it for us or Kashmir) or we actually figure out a way to stop militancy without harassing regular civilians non-stop. Unfortunately, we as a country have completely failed Kashmiris in this regard and we completely deserve their hatred.\n\n"
'Out of curiosity, what are the general demographics of the students there? And why did you not try to join a different college in mainland India?'
'I thought that Kashmiri muslims hated India and loved the terrorists (or separatists just so nobody gets angry at me). How do they reconcile with idiots who burn down schools?'
'And it is sad considering schools and colleges are the way out for most people out of poverty and that opportunity is taken away from them, leading them into protests and the circle begins again.'
"I don't even know why the fuck they want J&K. It's not like the state sends a lot of RS MPs, it's extremely bad PR, it puts them in an uncomfortable position vis a vis their nationalist credentials and it just generally shows a lack of strategy in BJP higher command. Plus, with the situation this bad, President's rule would have been imposed a long time back if it was a UPA-NC alliance in state. "
'Yes I know I made a wrong decision. I could get into a couple of good private colleges but they had insane fees. And NIT had less fee. So I thought okay it\'s a NIT after all. Also read a few things on the internet- " College is what you make of it and blah blah". \n\n**seriously regretting now** because I have no college. All I can make is shit out of it. \n\nAlso the situation in Kashmir was pretty much okay after 2010. No major shutdowns. But guess what. 2016 turned out to be the next one. '
'Students are pretty much from all parts of India. UP,MP,Rajasthan, Bihar, Andhra etc. \n\nI did a mistake. Still regretting. '
'The protesters are a very miniscule percentage of the population. '
'^(Finally this comment is visible!)\n\nBut why would JK Police beat you for unfurling Indian flag? I thought they hated all the militants & separatists there.\n'
"Yeah, that's not true for sure. I don't know where you got this idea from."
'Because JK police has K in it too. And those Kashmiri policemen wanted to beat the hell out of students with Indian Flags in Kashmir. \n\nAfter beating a student up( he had his arm fractured) the policeman said and I quote,**"Hindustani Kutta"**'
'But but, I thought Islam treated men and women equally more so than any other religion? Thats what they keep on telling me on TV.\n\nWas I misled all those years?\n\nEdit: I was been sarcastic. :)'
"We need a Uniform Civil Code. Disbanding religious laws outright may lead to riots, but a parallel to the 'Special Marriage Act' should exist for all religions - i.e. an opt-in uniform civil code that overrides religious codes may be less politically charged than scrapping religious codes outright. This reduces the burden on courts for trivial matters currently being handled by parallel redressal mechanisms (in the case religious courts, gram panchayats etc), while still being always being available as an option for anyone whose secular democratic rights are being trampled upon by religion.

Khula is the process through which a Muslim woman can divorce. It’s long and elaborate.\n\nShajada Khatoon said she decided to divorce through a letter, which she signed at the press conference, because her husband and clerics were avoiding her plea for 18 months.\n\n“Juber Ali made my life hell just a few days after I got married on November 14, 2005. The torture was so much that I filed a case against him. But that too did not bring relief,” she said.\n\n“I wish I’ll be free from today.”\n\nKhatoon, a schoolteacher, has not been living with her husband for the past 18 months.\n\nShe sent a letter seeking divorce on September 6 to her husband, a mechanic in a consumer goods store in Lucknow’s Daliganj area.\n\n“I am living alone without any support or security from anyone. No one has the right to compel me now to live with my husband and if someone has an objection they might move court,” she said.\n\nAccording to Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahli, member the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, such a khula is not accepted.\n\nIt has a procedure wherein the husband is served notices on the request of the wife. A verdict is given if the husband does not turn up after three notices.\n\n“If the husband turns up on the first notice and agrees for it, they are allowed to separate and the woman can live with whoever she wishes to. Sometimes husband does not turn up and this takes over a year but in no case a letter can be a base for khula,” Mahli said.\n\nAdvocate Rijwan Ahmad, who was present at the press conference, said no one can compel her to live with that man since she had filed for a divorce.\n\n“Now if someone has a problem they might go to court,” he said.\n\nAccording to social activist Naish Hasan, the woman visited clerics for help but could not get any.\n\nNaish is the general secretary of Muslim Woman League.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"And neither did Nehru before Gandhi whimsically decided to make him the PM. This was independent India's very first instance of political nepotism and set the trend for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> The last date for the nominations for the post of the President of Congress, and thereby the first Prime Minister of India, was April 29, 1946. And the nominations were to be made by 15 state/regional Congress committees. **Despite Gandhi's well-known preference for Nehru as Congress president, not a single Congress committee nominated Nehru's name. On the contrary, 12 out of 15 Congress committees nominated Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The remaining three Congress committees did not nominate any body's name.** Obviously, the overwhelming majority was in favour of Sardar Patel.\n\n\n\n> It's not that Gandhi was not aware of the immorality  of this exercise. He had fully realized  that what he was trying to bring about was wrong and totally unfair. In fact, he tried to make Nehru understand the reality. He conveyed to Nehru that no PCC has nominated his name and that only a few CWC members have nominated him. **A shell-shocked Nehru was defiant and made it clear that he will not play second fiddle to any body. A disappointed Gandhi gave into Nehru's obduracy  and asked Sardar Patel to withdraw his name. Sardar Patel had immense respect for Gandhi and he withdrew his candidature without wasting any time.** And it paved the way for the  coronation of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru as India's first Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n> But Gandhi's decision proved too costly for the nation. **First of all, Gandhi introduced the concept of forced decisions by the so-called ‘high-commands' that usually means overruling state units. This practice, now being followed across the political spectrum, has negated the very concept of innner party democracy.** Nehru's follies on Kashmir and China proved beyond doubt the fact that Gandhi committed a  mistake in backing Nehru by showing utter disregard to  overwhelming support  from the majority of PCCs for Sardar Patel.\n\n\n\n[Source](http://www.indiatvnews.com/politics/national/why-gandhi-opted-for-nehru-and-not-sardar-patel-for-pm-6689.html)"

'India has two major problems. Having revisited in 2012, I can attest to these still being prevalent and will continue to be issues for the next 30 years minimally.\n\n1-1. Highly conservative culture that dominates top to bottom of all power and social structures.\n\nCollege and high school guys/girls are basically engaging in promiscuous behaviors in complete secrecy, effectively leading two lives. One with parents of propriety and one with friends, that is more westernized and freer. But this is still on the down low.\n\nThere\'s still a pervasive belief of relationships where sex and intimacy is a byproduct than an active component for success of a stable relationship. I have a friend who rejects the idea of explorative dating and determining sexual compatibility (it\'s a legit thing, look it up). She\'s been dating a guy for three years now and their relationship has progressed to kissing and holding hands. Doesn\'t want to take it further until after marriage, and she\'s an atheist. Mostly due to fear that if she does, and blurbs of her encounters, her parents will lose their shit and think she\'s highly promiscuous.\n\nIt\'s insane.\n\n1-2. The spread of liberalized cultural traits down into the roots is extremely slow with respect to the rate at which population is growing (explosive). Both factors are contributing to deviancy as younger generations attempt to rebel against institutions that are shoehorning traditional ideas into what is becoming a more decentralized society, where the expectations are that there is more agency per person than ever before.\n\nThis inevitably leads to pockets of absolutely degeneration, with rape and ultra violence against men and women within the country, though women moreso. Further, since huge parts of the country remains rural, critical societal technologies and ideas don\'t advance out beyond cities. This leads to entrenchment of poor community practices, one of which is a point of racism in Western hemispheres, defecation and urination in the streets.\n\nThis has an unintended consequence of clashing with globalization. These entrenched communities are facing a world that is rapidly evolving and rapidly trying to integrate into a highly connected information state. So more and more you get "poo in the loo" racist remarks that prevail the net. Which in turn makes many Indians feel like they must become more proper and be brought up to civilization.\n\nAll in all leading to a feedback loop of uplift clashing against conservatism all clashing with a bubbling population all clashing with a poorly educated country-side all being widely ignored by most government power structures because attempting to fix the problem requires more time and resources, now, than the government has the capacity to provide. And attempting to provide them would directly detract from the ability of the country to grow and keep pace with the continuing path of globalization.\n\nIt\'s a catch-22, where the only solution is to do both simultaneously, to accept faults and spend all your political capital on solutions that are going to piss off several hundred million people, *and*, are going to be root causes for a lot of problems within communities who will attempt to resist against government enforcing practices that are in direct contradiction of their known way of life that has been a common for decades if not more.\n\nBut in 30-50 years, once the current Conservative populace has passed away and the current, more free thinking younger generation has come into power and established itself, the country might have a chance to turn things around.'

"It's great as a revenge fantasy, but the thing is if word gets out about the torture or even a video of it, It normalizes it in the minds of psychopaths or your average idiot.

'Yes, but it outlines the basis under which the officer was suspended. It isn\'t "he said something bad about Modi!" it\'s he is "attempting to provoke communal tensions"\n\nIt\'s quite likely to be a baseless claim, but isn\'t uncovering that the fucking journalists job, rather than spewing sensationalist conclusions?'
'Then shoudnt he have been suspended earlier only? Seems like people only took notice when he criticized modi.'

'You like hyperbole, but Sanjayji was evil. Thousands died to sate his ego and bloodlust, with Indraji\'s blessing of course. He was Islamophobic too. On one occasion, he decided to "beautify" Delhi and clear the jhuggis blocking his view of the India Gate. Legends say he stood at his balcony with binoculars and eagerly watched the eviction of muslims with bulldozers. When he got annoyed at the slow pace, the police were instructed to fire to disperse the freshly evicted. Around 400 people were killed to sate his bloodlust that day.

Just noise and no substance. Not to mention not a single respectable face on front.

Better prepare for other state elections and 2024'
'>How has the current government treated public institutions? Are they the same, diminished or more robust?\nThey are diminished, but again, the Congress started the rot. The Congress [appointed] its friends; the current Government, those who are ideologically Right. I have had disagreements with my friends in JNU about it because they feel I have blamed the Left. But the Left started it. And the Congress. Particularly when it came to universities or institutes like the Teen Murti—when it came to choosing a head, they didn’t choose the No 1, No 2, No 3, but No 10, because he was loyal to them. Now these guys [appointed by the NDA] are going to be No 100 or No 200 because they have no one. But the procedure was tainted by the Congress and the Left.\n\nThis. When you start a rot, it is only obvious that ppl who may or may not be worse than you, will impose their own ideological goals where you once tried to. '
"Haven't voted yet but I will next time and it'll be to Congress. I've seen so much shit in the last year that I can't risk BJP getting the majority again."
"No a supporter of RG. But this is absurd. I have seen worse opposition during UPA 1 and no one asked Advani to retire. If Congress wants him let them have him. It is their choice. Opposition cannot be held responsible for Government's failure/tyrannical approach. A new leader will arise in opposition. Maybe it would be Nitish/Naveen/Mamata and take over the mantle but there will always be opposition no matter what"
"irrespective of how vile Rahul Gandhi & the whole congress party is, my vote is 100% going to them in 2019. Modi is a fuckin narcissistic psycho! don't want him getting 10 years into power..god forbid, if he does, I can only shudder at the possibilities of what he can reduce this country to..i'll emigrate the fuck out of this shithole"

"
'I find him biased a lot of time. '
'This is classic apologetic argument to cover up the failure that has been BJP. The big problems with Congress were corruption and and sycophancy to the Gandhis. Corruption exists as much now (plus they took down RTI which exposed earlier corruption), sycophancy to Modi/Yogi/RSS is worse than to Gandhis and on top of that we have the rise of Hindu terrorism, language imposition, degradation of environment and fucking up the economy. BJP is worse than Congress on every aspect and then some more.'
"What happened in the 10 years of Congress again? People say whatever without knowing what they're talking about. Corruption is persecutable, incompetence is not. Compared to the economy right now and the change India saw from 2004 to 2014 it's not even a comparison. Congress needs to get rid of the Gandhis because the people have no trust in them and they're kinda shit at this, but if they put up leaders like Manmohan and Tharoor I, and I'm sure majority, of the people will have no problem voting for them. They're just not getting the message that's loud and clear from the populace; get rid of Rahul Gandhi then we'll talk. \n\nAnd I'm not even touching the hindutva cancer baggage BJP comes with. It's more like dog shit and a cow shit with a rapidly spreading cancer gene literally killing people. "
'Cow shit is way better than dog shit. Dog shit can make you go blind. Cow shit is pretty harmless and good for plants. Easy choice.'
"I'm no BJP supporter but given the state of the world, Gandhi being the next PM would be disastrous for India. Its a pivotal moment in global history and India cannot afford to have incompetent leadership. It could be make or break for India."
'Lol then why do you hate the BJP? Anyone who thinks NaMo is the lesser evil against anyone, not just RaGa, just has a very shaky sense of evil, and kinda belongs in the BJP camp.'
"Really? \nEven if RAGA comes I don't think he will do screwups like demo. At least he knows his incompetence, not like dear leader"
"Don't worry BJP has catching up fast. By 2019 it would have highest number of lynchings, killings, economy screwups, autocracy incompetence and poverty to rival congress.\n\nSee just 2 full terms and how much they have acheived"
"50 years of Scamgress rule has given India cancer. India and China were at the same level in 1960s. Chinese economy is today 5 times India's. This is what Congress party gave India."

'I shot the bullet but before it hit the buck , it got a heart attack and died'
"Well I agree with Bhai.With no witnesses around and only all those involved are celebrities themselves including Bebo and his Damadji Saif,Mohnish,Neelam etc. He can say just about anything.The prosecution is weak as usual because Indians,does not mean it's Bhai's fault."
"Perhaps the Blackbuck actually died of natural causes, but hell no, don't let the court decide that !  \n\npeople here have already decided how it died !"
'well what can we say about great India ,he got free from charges of murder when he drove the car over footpath,and also when he made his bodyguard\'s life miserable and he died,No one said anything to him for that and now you are expecting to give him severe punishment just for killing a black buck...common guys!\nI dont know why people are crazy about him he is suck an overrated actor..."OOPS SUCH"*'

'as with most things related to GST - this confuses more than it explains'
'MRP should be done away with. Another shit rule. '
"We will rather not have clear pricing guidelines like [these](https://i.imgur.com/Izd1G33.png) in [Australia](https://i.imgur.com/5nHwo4u.png), instead we will make it more bureaucratic. Waste janta's time and money, because we have incompetent babus. "
'If a product has MRP Rs 10, the store may show it as 8+1+1, in which case, you do need to pay the taxes..  or it may show it as 10 without showing the breakup..  either case you need to pay 10. If they are showing it as 10+1+1=10, its still OK, but if it is 10+1+1=12, its wrong'
"This is no different from earlier VAT. It's just that our education system does not focus on building financial quotient. "
'As it has happened from time immemorial. \n\nVAT, GST etc are just that...taxes. Retailers and their suppliers are now forced to pay the taxes, the government has not raised the taxes in general, hence the price increase in commodities.'
'Who told this campaign is bad ?\nI have posted in serious way not in some funny subreddit...'
'MRP is a godsend in a country where majority of the people use debit cards instead of credit cards.   \nIt\'s really embarrassing when you buy a few items but get a shock of a 10%-25% price increase at the counter.  \nAlso MRP should make it illegal to overcharge for an item during a natural disaster or those "refrigeration charges" on soft drinks, IIRC.  \n\n'
'... makes it look sarcastic '
"India in 2017.\n\nCan you refute a single point? Nope.\n\nRefute this: artists, creators, traders are not tax collectors. Modi has made them just that. That too tax collectors without a salary, medical benefits and leaves. And the punishment of not collecting tax for modi is jail!\n\nSo either artists, creators, traders learn the art of tax collection (as if creation of a good or service that others want isn't hard enough) which they're not interested in or they just stop creating.\n\nSo artists, creators, traders take up on themselves the wraith of common man (as everybody hates tax collectors) while modi the end benefactor of the tax collected rises in popularity through fake employment, ease of business numbers."
'> "refrigeration charges"\n\nyep, one of the most stupid things I\'ve heard. That too in the **Silicon valley of India**.'
"MRP is enforced with supermarkets,etc so they cannot provide a luxury shopping experience. But it is not enforced in one off bus stops in the middle of nowhere,etc..  so you still get extorted. With no MRP, at least the organized sector will not be limited in what facilities it can provide (and the unorganized sector will not be impacted since they don't follow MRP anyways)"
"Why downvotes? Doesn't this prove that Reddit is still a modi shill and waphat negative post about modi we see are there because he wants them to be there!!"
"As I said 'in general'. Some items are now taxed more while others are cheaper,On average taxes are same, also people quote VAT rates which were lower, but GST replaces multiple cascading taxes(VAT,service tax etc) hence figures are incomparable.\n\nThe depth of taxes has NOT been increased only the width has been increased to force more people, As a result there is more revenue for the government and hence rumors of reducing the tax rates further.\n\nIf you demand the bill with GSTN you have effectively forced everyone in the supply chain to pay the tax and not just shopkeeper. \n\nplease go through https://yourstory.com/read/7ee4a4600e-what-is-the-difference  for further uderstanding "

'>With no MRP, at least the organized sector will not be limited in what facilities it can provide\n\nOh yes,we know how the organised sector so *dedicated* to *serve* the people./s\n\nNow is not a good time to talk about this,bruh. We dont want any more disruptive regulation reforms. Just let the economy to settle down. And then forget about it.'
'So why is there no MRP on onions, tomatoes? \n\nDespite of MRP, in natural calamities no one pays heed to MRP regulations anyway. Local kiranas are not big on rules. Besides, that is the whole point of supply and demand economics. Scarce product, or more demand (as it happens during natural calamities) price shoots up. \n\nSo you want burden to be shifted to corporates, they should be sending 1000 versions of same product with different MRPs, rather than just manufacturing the product and leaving it upto wholesalers to decide the price?\n\nI think vegetables should be brought under MRP too, let kisans make some bucks too. '
'> We dont want any more disruptive regulation reforms. Just let the economy to settle down. And then forget about it.\n\n\nI was talking about removing the regulation :) ...  and I personally see nothing wrong if say, PVR wants to sell water at Rs 400 a liter. There will always be plenty of competition in such cases (where the organized sector sells stuff at unreasonable rates). And there will be no impact on the unorganized sector since it doesnt follow MRP anyways. \n\n(AFAIK India is literally the only country to have the MRP concept...  Why do you think it would be so disastrous to eliminate it?) '
'Its disastrous because we dont fully understand its purpose and what impact it might cause. I mean look at GST. It was supposed to help us. But it made life worse. Costs increased,people were clueless and so was the govt on the guidelines. Even if this rule elimination was a necessary step,i would want an economist on top who makes informed decisions. Not this fucking bulldozer trio. Took them a very serious backlash for them to fucking listen & fix GST. \n\nStop trying to rock the boat. I will never ever speak about black money or corruption because i dont want another demo. Just so that some clueless fucker who never ran a business can act/look tough and dictate me what to do? Fuck the reforms. They always end up serving the corporates and fucking over the rest of us.'

"> Raghuram Rajan, Manmohan Singh and Amartya Sen will be laughing\n\nI think you underestimate them. I honestly don't think they take glee from the fact that Modi single-handedly sabotaged the Indian economy. \n\nThey're better than that. Furthermore, they know the massive human cost that DeMo inflicted on the weakest sections of society, and those are the sections they are most concerned about. \n\nDeMo was a man-made disaster and it hit the poorest the hardest. Most Randians were at worst mildly inconvenienced. Many informal workers literally lost their entire livelihoods and some even died waiting in queue. "
"It's accurate. Amount of black money stored in currency is very low.  Demonetisation only affected small time crooks and black money hoarders. "

'If BJP really wants a positive sentiment toward India, they would stop victimizing the people at large of Kashmir. What this picture shows is that people are willing to listen to you. They understand emotions. You just need to explain it to them properly that Pakistan is using separatist sentiments in the youth to ruin their lives. '
"I'm confused now"
"But these things don't fit our narrative."
'You may be right. \n\nIndian Army has stationed Rashtriya Rifles in Kashmiri cities for counterinsurgency operations. Regular Army is on the border. \n\nThe government should consider posting only native Kashmiris for counterinsurgency operations inside cities. This might reduce violence. '
"He was a local boy, that's why. People in small towns have a stronger sense of community and collectively mourn deaths, especially those of youth who die prematurely."
"Wasn't it obvious. Patriotic Indians who go out to mourn the death of every soldier has probably got nothing else to do in life. The point of the article was serving the Indian family did not make people ostracize the family like one would have assumed."
"This. Otherwise Kashmiri people wouldn't care less. They are more brainwashed than ISIS."
'So fucking what? He was a soldier regardless and we all know how the army treats Kashmiris. And they used the Indian flag. So fuck off with your pessimistic bs.'
"India hasn't lost Kashmir, and I am not justifying Chidambaram's views, but if the government would listen to him and do something to stop the alienation, it'd be better. We are misdirecting our anger towards a dead dog(Congress). Instead, it should be targeted towards the BJP-PDP combine. Even Yashwant Sinha, who just returned from the Valey has suggested that situation is fragile, and not moving towards normalcy. As soon as the weather warms up again, so will the tempers and the protests can restart."
'> You just need to explain it to them properly that Pakistan is using separatist sentiments in the youth to ruin their lives. \n\nNo, what actually needs to be done is provide economic development in Kashmir. The situation in Kashmir is like the Berlin War, one side became a capitalist dream and the other a communist nightmare\n\nIf Indian administration cut through the political bullshit and creates a good economic environment then finding recruits among Kashmiri youths would be harder'
'Kashmiris are individuals, not all of them think alike, there are some who are pro, some who are anti and yet some others who are fence sitters. Those who overtly display there support for India do so at grave risk to their lives from the jihadis who follow no rules.'

'Rashtriya Rifles is the regular Army. It is not a new regiment or some other organization. It is just all the regiments of the Army organized into a counterinsurgency unit in the valley. All regiments send troops to it.\n\nNormal peacekeeping and riot control falls under CRPF. I think they are the ones in the pellet gun controversy.

"> The government should consider posting only native Kashmiris for counterinsurgency operations inside cities. This might reduce violence. \n\nThere is a reason we don't do that. We don't completely trust the local Kashmiris. Also, if some day there is a situation where populace turns against us, having no significant presence of loyal armed forces can be detrimental to the interests of India.\n"

">Don't get into narration of BJP and crime lord Modi-Shah.\n\nWhen the valley is starting to look peaceful if he says stuff like this than I have every right to say what I like. So should I change my narrative because Modi-Shah also believe in the same. That was my opinion. I am saying it again Chidambaram is antinational in my opinion. This is my freedom of speech. Had Congress handled the situation better all these years we would have not reached this point of losing Kashmir. I am not very open minded like him or Congress. Just go and watch on FB Kashmiris are celebrating his comments. It is not that they have developed this hatred towards India in the last 3 years. It has been so for a long time during UPA too. This is nothing but trying to score political points against BJP. First of all he must answer his sons corruption as alleged by Swamy. Then he can speak on such issues.\n\nThe hatred Kashmiris have towards India shows how much bad Indian government was at handling Kashmir all these years. 3 years in the government and you want to blame the present government for it. All I could listen from people is Modi should not have responded with surgical strikes and let the army men die. That has been happening through decades and it was this weakness we displayed that allowed Pakistan to change mind of Kashmiris. \n"
'Removing Article 370 will destroy the entire basis on which Kashmir attaches to Indian political system and we will loose whatever legal right we have on the territory.'
'> I think BJP will value any suggestion on these situations.\n\nIf they were valuing suggestions on how to manage Kashmir, 2016 wouldn\'t have exploded the way it did. It was all pent-up anger, and we are having our Army men killed every second day because of this political failure.\n\n> Saying things in public doesn\'t fetch you anything.\n\nIt does. It shifts the public attention towards the bungling of the situation in Kashmir by the government. Their foolish narratives like "Demonetisation killed militancy and stone throwing" can\'t stand. They can\'t go on about a tactical victory(Surgical Strikes) when they are faced with a higher death count and a losing strategy. It makes the rest of India aware that Kashmir is not temporarily peaceful because of govt measures, but despite it. That come summer, and the protests can be back. This public attention and popular pressure is what drives action in a democracy. The government will then be faced with going all-out in securing peace in the Valley, whether it means talking to Geelani or whoever, it will have to be pursued. We can\'t have Kashmiris and security-personnel dying like 2008, 2010 or 2016.\n\nI see your perspective and what you are trying to say. But if you are worried about the global view on Kashmir, Chidambaram\'s statement is the least of the concerns. The protests in 2016, the pellet-guns usage, South Kashmir going rogue, speak far more loudly than anything Chidambaram can say.\n\n\n>Instead of speaking about the development in the valley and making them comfortable the stance taken by Congress and communists is worsening the situation.\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of a Kashmiri, would a Delhi based politician telling me about development in my state pacify me? I would rather have Chidambaram taking this stance than painting Kashmiris as mercenaries who are "anti-nationals" and throw stones for money. The Times Now and the right wing narrative does more harm to alienate Kashmiris than Chidambaram\'s statement. You only need to follow a couple of Kashmiri newspapers to get an understanding what angers them.\n\n>No one from Pakistan is making such statements but only Indians are making such statements.\n\nYou need to read more than what the Indian media feeds you. Pakistan talks far worse, but that is not our concern, that\'s expected.\n\n>But had that happened in Saudi Arabia or America or any other country the action taken by government would have been far worse.\n\nSaudi Arabia, yes. America, no. Even if America would have jailed, tortured or killed him, why do we need to follow that standard? What are our own institutions and laws for? And as per our SC judgements, the case wouldn\'t have stood in court. It was the BJP who targeted him, and it blew up in their face. The support was not as much for what they said, but for their right to say it, and not be termed "anti-national". Dissent is the hallmark of a healthy democracy. I don\'t know why we have to be so insecure about that.\n \n'
'Idk anymore with trump in power but I doubt America would take any action unless they are threatening to do something. Saying "supreme court murdered them" or "Yakub menon is innocent" wont land you in trouble. We are talking about a country where students were protesting against an ongoing war (vietnam) and people still speak out against the war on terror and some people even criticise soldiers. Also if our government took action, what kind of precedent would it set? Peaceful protest must be allowed always no matter what they say. (unless its a direct threat)'
"> World has already has a quite confused view of the Kashmir situation.\n\nI think it's Indian citizens who have a confused view. And they have been confused by our government.\n\n> If I am a stranger I would definitely think India is the one who occupied Kashmir.    \n\nThey have, haven't they? Kashmiris don't want to be part of India.\n"
'Kashmir problem is long story of bad handling of events and Paksitan involvement on continuously disturbing peace. I am not putting blame of past years on your crime lords, its the crime lord and his goons like you label anything unpleasant about Kashmir as anti-nation. \n\nAny where in world if you kill 13-14 year old its human right violation. But the in India it is celebrated. If military was the solution why we are not able see peace in Kashmir even after more than 25 years and billions of tax payers money dumped in. \n\nHatred suits politicians well in remaining in power but peace will bring prosperity for the country. If this being understood would stop following narration of your war lords and congi leaders. Stop labeling everything anti-nation.  '

"Nothing. Kashmiris tried carrying out peaceful protests instead of violence. Indian state policies didn't change, they still used violent suppression instead of engagement, they took the peace for granted, just as the BJP is doing right now. People seem very eager to ascribe shitty policies to individual political parties - but Indian state policies on most things are mostly contiguous independent of the political party in power. \n\nAs of last year there seems to have been a slight resurgence of violent ideas. These ideas haven't been expressed as large scale return to arms yet, but they might. \n\nOn the whole, big attention grabbing terror attacks aside, violence in India has been consistency reducing, including during the congress years - barring a few upticks in 2016 and 2014. Maybe a function of economic growth? Or maybe I'm not giving enough credit to the incredible progress Indian diplomacy has made in national and international fora since the early 2000s.\n \nhttp://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/database/indiafatalities.htm\n\nAnyone claiming that 'terror attacks still haven't stopped' does not realize how bad things were 10-15 years ago.

"Basically Vinod Rai's estimates were based on a small sliver of spectrum which was resold by one party to another. Let's saw 0.1% of the spectrum was sold, Rai just multiplied it by 1000 to get his number.\n\nHe did not factor in the fact that the reason that sliver demanded such a high price was because the resource was scarce and spectrum was hard to buy. If someone offered to sell me water in the middle of the sahara I would pay more per liter than if someone sold it to me in meghalaya.\n\nSimilarly, when all spectrum was auctioned in bulk the second time, prices were much lower, and much closer to the prices in the first auction.\n\nAlthough all the numbers associated with the scam 'loss to exchequer' etc are essentially imaginary, (I can go deeper into this if people are interested) the scam is real. There was a lot of arbitrary favouritism being done to disqualify certain parties so that certain business groups would be guaranteed spectrum. At around the same time A Raja was meddling in the auction process to get competitors disqualified based on technicalities - A Raja got richer by 3000 crore, and this was believed to be due to bribes... although I can't find a good detailed explanation of how this whole thing worked."

Not only is this a mockery of democracy, but in its basic hierarchy is a flourishing feudal system inside what is put forth to the world as a democracy.

"I look at it this way. I travel everyday from Miyapur towards Hitech City via Kondapur. There is one stretch of road from Shilpa Park to the kondapur RTO office which usually gets battered during monsoon. It happens every year without fail.\n\nEverytime it happened during Congress regime, it wasn't fixed till months. I remember poor Lok Satta guys standing with banners to pressurize the administration to fix it. This year the rainfall was more then normal, still within 2 weeks the roads were re-laid. As interim measure sometime they would be filled with mud within a day. There are still some gaps of course e.g Miyapur to BHEL stretch has a bad patch. But even with all the shortcomings I would rate TRS admin over Congress atleast on the roads front."

"The PR is working too. \n\nI always wanted to say this, right time now. There was a 'dry waste wet waste' campaign done in Hyd. Under this, two dust bins were given to each house to collect dry and wet waste separately. This was such terribly executed. Each house was given two dust bins of different colours, but all it had was a GHMC sticker. Nothing else on it, don't know which one was for dry waste & wet waste. No GHMC workers came to collect the dry and wet separately. Nothing after that.\n\n I went to two of my bachelor friends rooms and they both had used these dustbins as water buckets. Seen others do this too. Such a waste, there goes 42 crore (I'm not sure about this amount), just like that. Was the idea implemented, no. **But on record** Hyd implemented 'dry waste wet waste' segregation. The only thing that actually happened in this scheme - people got water buckets... I mean dust bins."

It's been almost a year and I haven't even opened their app.    "
"I tried uber, but there were no cabs all the time. Ola also had similar situation, but I could place the pin a kilometer away and either ride an auto till there or ask the cabbie to come a bit further if there's no traffic. I used to get in conversation with almost every cabbie and every cabbie told Uber wasn't quick with crediting the money to account. Ola used to credit the earned money at the end of the day, and Uber had weekly payouts, which were some times not paid in full, when there was a negative review. Judging these cabbies from my ride, I could say they would always get negative reviews on uber. \n\nFrom what I could tell, they seemed to be very happy to see their money at the end of the day rather than the end of the week. \n\nOtherwise, I would be choosing Uber over Ola.

Even pedo behaviour just gets hushed up, so hardly anything gets called out.\n\nAdd to this weird ideas about caste and purity, quirks in religion and strange attitudes towards cleaners and service staff.\n\nHaving said that the actual problem here is that open defecation is a problem - whether people do it in public view is a secondary issue. A massive number of women don't use toilets and this puts them at risk of getting raped. So you have a country where women defecate openly and this puts them at risk of rape.\n\nOpen defecation really points out how horribly backwards India is. The more you read about, you start seeing how it's not an access or poverty issue, which makes it much more pathetic.

He died on February 2\n\nSnake rescuer Somnath Mhatre’s name will go down in history books. Not for rescuing a prized cobra, but for dying of a bite from the reptile while kissing its head for a photo-op. Mhatre is the 31st snake rescuer to die in the last 12 years from the snakebite he suffered while performing the oft-repeated pecking stunt.\n\nAlso read: 'Rescuers' bitten by snakes they were trying to catch in Mumbai\n\nActivists are now calling on the Forest Department (FD) to issue guidelines to prevent such incidents and take action against those involved in performing and posting pictures of such stunts.\n\nSnake turns, bites\n\nSomnath, a resident of CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai, died of the bite on February 2. A snake rescuer from the area said, “As per the information told to us by his friend, Somnath had gone to rescue a snake from a car at CBD Belapur, but after rescuing the cobra he took it to another location where he was trying to attempt the act of kissing the cobra on its head, when suddenly, the snake turned and bit Somnath on his chest.”\n\nAlso read: In Vasai, man bitten by snake that he rescued\n\nBefore Somnath, another rescuer from Satara died after suffering a snake bite while he was trying to kiss a cobra. According to another snake rescuer, Somnath was hospitalised for five days at a hospital in Navi Mumbai. He’d rescued more than 100 venomous snakes in the past.\n\nSlither to some action\n\nHerpetologist and wildlife photographer Kedar Bhide has compiled the data on such deaths along with other experts. They are part of the voices of several conservationists who feel that FD should take some serious steps in order to avoid further incidents.\n\nA meeting to this effect was last held on December 17, 2014 at Nagpur in the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest’s office, in which some mitigation measures to train snake rescuers and take action against illegal snake activities in the state were discussed.\n\nBhide and others working in the field of snake conservation feel that the need of the hour is to take collective actions to stop such deaths and illegal activities like snake shows. The researchers also feel that such incidences are harming snake conservation work as well as undermining the Wildlife Protection Act, by illegal handling and hoarding of snakes.\n\nFocus on research\n\nBhide told mid-day, “In today’s world, our snake conservation efforts should move away from snake handling, snake shows and towards rescuing them to create a society of co-existence, reduction of snakebites and fatalities and more focus on researching about the species.”\n\nGanesh Mehendale, from Nisarga Giribhraman, a Roha-based NGO working in the field of snake conservation and rescue said, “It’s high time now that the forest department started taking serious action against those involved in performing these stunts using venomous and non-venomous snakes, because doing such things is against the law. There have been many instances where snake rescuers have lost their lives while rescuing the snakes and there needs to be a protocol to deal with the same.”\n\n\n\n______\n\n\n\n^Version ^: ^1.0a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/5pr3ac/changelog/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/5pr33h/10a_commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n\n\n______\n\n\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)"

'Quick story: Few years back was going abroad and was standing in queue for immigration. In the queue next to me, the officer at the immigration counter disappeared for 15 minutes. There were an old couple (not well to do) standing at the front of the line and were worried they might miss the flight and were asking around. The officer came back and started yelling at them saying "Abroad jaa rahe ho toh humpe aisaan kar rahe ho? Thodi der rukne nahi aata?" The couple were completely shaken and started apologizing to the officer, as if it was their mistake.\n\n\nUnfortunately I have had similar unfriendly experiences most of the time. Be it immigration offices, customs officers or even loaders, the story is the same at most Indian airports.'
"Ego. It all comes back to ego, and that's why this country is so fucked up. Everyone thinks they're king and have the right to walk all over people and show no respect. \n\nEgo is the root cause for everything wrong in this country."
'This is so true. My god I always told mom no matter where I travelled to I was always the most nervous coming back to India. I had this fear what if they dont let me in my own country. These people are so goddamn rude. I saw one officer once screaming at a young student going abroad so bad because he had stepped the line by mistake. He already looked so nervous. \nI have no respect for these assholes acting like they own the world just cause they are at a position of power. \nI wish there was a way to complain and that these complaints would be taken seriously.

"Good thing you never had to deal with the shitlords sitting at the visa on arrival counters in different airports in India. I land at 2300 and there is not one officer in sight among the 5 counters set up for this. Around 20 people are waiting. One guy is sitting there watching videos on his phone. I ask him to go find someone who would help us and he says the other counters are busy, so wait. WTF?\n\nAfter 20 minutes, one guy comes over and slowly starts computer etc. Another guy comes over to tell him how to do the Visa on Arrival thing. And they cannot figure out the positioning of the camera etc. By this time, the babies are sleeping or crying as they had to woken up for the camera etc. Finally, we get out at 0020 or so and that fucker in the corner is still sitting watching movies on his phone. I did ask him how I could apply for his job and he didn't look very happy at that. \n\nFirst point of contact and impression for Indian services to foreigners (embassy, visa office, immigration) has always been shit around the world.

I asked them how much did they pay for tokens/tickets, and they said and you won't believe it , ₹1600. Yes fucking ₹1600, so the token vender at a metro station rip these poor people by saying they can actually buy Indian railways train ticket in the metro stations and these tokens will be acceptable in the train bound for bihar.

I'm concerned about those who aren't, and that's a choice too. \nAnd it's the governments job to make things simple for every body. But they are complicating things day by day, bringing what not to disrupt normal life of common people. We are a 3rd world country.

"There are some folks in the thread that are saying it does not cause pollution or affect air quality. That is factually incorrect. Here is a primer in the chemistry involved.. When you ignite a firecracker it sets of a chemical reaction similar or identical to this one:\n\n10KNO3 + 3S + 8C → 2K2CO3 +3K2SO4 + 6CO2 + 5N2\n\n(Source: http://www.chemistryislife.com/the-chemistry-of-gunpowder)\n\nI am not a toxicologist or a chemist. But if you look at the right side of that equation,  the K2SO4 will readily dissolve in the humidity in air and may serve as an irritant to soft tissue.\n(Source: http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC34245)\n\n If not that, it most definitely serves as particulate in the air. I also don't like the excess nitrogen produced by that reaction. \n\nAdditionally, firecrackers may contain a whole bunch of metal salts, which give color to the explosion (e.g. lithium carbonate, barium oxide etc.) Inhaling the fumes of such salts is almost always bad (Source: http://nj.gov/health/eoh/rtkweb/documents/fs/1124.pdf).\n\nIts one thing to defend your religious freedoms but it is quite another to deny scientific facts. The premise that exploding firecracker does not significantly alter the chemical make of ambient air is wrong based on the chemistry described above. I wrote this comment because recent events have shown us how ignoring scientific facts can bring the world to the edge of a precipice. I feel such ignorance should have no place in our country and on forums like r/india\n\nEdit: If somebody has a better understanding of the chemistry involved, I urge you to school me with sources. "

'Supreme Court is acting like a dictator. I stopped bursting crackers long time back but will do so if this ban is still there next Diwali.'
'The reason SC is giving such apparently populist (or populist at least to most loud demographic) is because it does not want to be scrutinized for collegium system and other shortcomings like corruption and inordinate delay in decision making.\n\nAny neutral observer will see hypocrisy in crying over beef ban and supporting this ban. Now fine differences between these two and various other bans will be brought forward. But when it was time to oppose beef ban, it was never said we do not support bans (subjective conditions apply). Because that will involve weighing on subtle differences between bans and yielding to middle ground that some bans can be enacted given sufficient majority believes in it.\n\nI personally believe ban is too much for temporally insignificant pollutant and that too from a court in an arbitrary manner.'

'Basically Yogi was shitting on Kerala during the Jana Raksha Yatra that BJP conducted in Kerala recently. He said that Kerala should  model their hospital systems on UP.\n\nMeanwhile, he also removed Taj Mahal from the UP tourism booklet for the year. Assume that the reason was the usual bhaktard logic of assuming that since the Taj was built by the Mughals, it is a shit place or that it was built on top of an older temple or something. \n\nSo, Kerala Tourism, which is supposed to be one of the better run tourism boards in the country, calls out Taj as being one of the reasons that foreigners visit India, on Twitter. This kinda goes against what Yogi wants.\n\nThat is why this is construed to be a burn.'
"There are thousands of ancient structures in India. Temples, Palaces, Mosques and Mausoleums.

This wealth was a result of India's flourishing manufacturing and trade.\n\nIt is true that making those structures did cost a fortune, but damn those Kings had a larger fortune to spend. In comparison Europe was poor and had huge political problems. Romans did create a large empire, but it was very unstable economically. And then Arabs came and conquered them.\n\nSo that comparison between India and Europe is pure nonsense."

'His story is quite amusing. There are many political equations surrounding Adityanath. He has been MP from Gorakhpur since 1998 however, Gorakhpur is an unusual political seat itself. It is famous for Gorakhnath Math (Temple), and whoever the temple elects, wins the elections from that seat. That is to say that the temple has a lot of power in politics of Gorakhpur.\n\nYou can read backstory of Adityanath on internet, however one important aspect about his political career is that he has never been a loyal BJP member. Same as Modi, he too is an arrogant narcissist, and runs in conflict with higher powers. Even before UP elections, it was rumored that Yogi might break off if not given the CM post.\n\nWhen it comes to inciting violence or giving hate speeches you can count on him. But for holding power over sometime, he is not that of a strong character.'

"Yes. That's why it was so humiliating for BJP."
"The poor always gets ripped off, and in multiple ways. Since you mention kirana stores, when malls and big departmental stores cropped up, there was a huge hue and cry that they were taking business away from the friendly neighbourhood kirana stores. Although this is true, no one talks about the flip side of kirana stores. Their storage is abysmal, what with rats and all; their goods could be adulterated (for example, sugar), and poor in quality without necessarily costing that much lesser; they give preferential service to big/rich customers (especially in small towns, both the rich and the poor buy from the same store); they rip off customers whenever they think they can get away with it (for example, the poor and the very young customers). You'd be surprised to know that the poor would be paying more for the same items that you pay less in a big departmental store. Why do the poor still buy from such kirana stores? Because 1) they get intimidated by big departmental stores 2) they cannot buy half kilo rice or quarter kg sugar in such stores.\n\nThis is just one example of how the poor are robbed. \n\nWhy do you think pawn shops are more in poorer neighbourhoods? They are easy pickings. \n\nThe poor are not poor in just money, they get everything less, too, in both quality and quantity. \n\nEdit: typo and added some lines"
'Poor uneducated villagers get screwed around endlessly. A maid I know of worked at a home for 3 years, and was not paid for those 3 years of work.\n\nBanks in the villages try to cheat these people as much as they can. Examples are there of them taking the money and not actually depositing it in the account.\n\nHave heard enough horrific stories, and not old ones. These are all recent. Being poor is a sin, and a grave sin in India. '
'Why do you expect the goonda to have her back? He is a goonda for a reason. Also I am pretty sure the mechanic would have charged you at least 500, if not more. The rich and the poor are exploited alike. I feel like this is not something common to India. I have been living in the US for more than an year now and I have experienced financial exploitation as well.'
'>Nobody cares anymore\n\nThis is not new. The common man has been romanticised in the media but he has never cared. Everyone in india is out to scam you and there is no concept of the collective good. This should not be news to you or to anyone, for that matter.'
"India is a poor country. All poor countries are tough countries. To survive and thrive, you need to be tough, street smart, and have a great deal of awareness and good judgment. You need to be able to fight for your rights aggressively when needed.\n\nThis woman's problem is not being born poor or born in India. Her problem is she was not willing to fight for her jewellry. She was not aware of how much a basic puncture costs while she drives a 2 wheeler every day. She was not aware of the repercussions and terms and conditions for a money lender loan. She has led a sheltered life because she was lucky to have a good family who sheltered her from most things.\n\nI am not at all saying blood sucking leeches do not exist. But please don't use poverty as some catchall blanket excuse. Or even lack of education. Or overpopulation. Which are standard rants on this sub.\n\nOne can be street smart and aware and informed and not get taken for a ride while still being poor and even uneducated. It is harder but not impossible. All those villagers? They are not fools, despite what you might think. They might be unaware of many things, yes."
"In addition to your incidents, I think really bad life choices and decisions IMO are the major reason why the poor remain poor. I give you 2 incidents from my life.\n\n1.My house maid was married at a very young age, and is also much younger than me (I'm 26), and she has a son who goes to a very good private school (which incidentally was the same school that I studied). He is sent to the school based on the government's RTE scheme but she is left to fund his other expenses of school. Her husband was / is a drunkard and often beats her or steals her money. He doesnt earn and only comes home occasionally to steal the money from her. She also has some court case going against him in their village. \n\nBut the interesting part is she constantly takes salary from my mother in advance of every month, spends on her vehicle's petrol, travel expenses to her villages, religious celebrations etc. She travels to her village atleast twice every month, and later complains of no money for her son's school fees. Is she not the one making very bad decisions and making her own life more difficult than it already is?\n\n2.A poor woman (in her 40s I think) walked upto my house one morning with her cow, singing some songs begging for food with the pretext of me getting blessing from the cow. (Cry me a river, for I am an atheist). But I gave / donated to her my morning breakfast of 3 idlies (honestly I dont like idlies and wouldnt eat them if it wasnt for my parents), and the next thing I see is her giving all the 3 idlies to the cow and she continuing to begg me for something else. I was so enraged that I just returned to my dining table to cool myself. I gave her the 3 idlies for her to eat, not for her cow. \n\n----------------------\n\nCry me a dime, but I am sick and tired of hearing people blaming others for their life problems (especially poverty). I understand that its difficult to get out of poverty, but if your own life priorities are not to get out of poverty and something else like cows and religious celebrations, you have absolutly no sympathy from me. You dont deserve any gov services which is funded by my tax money, if your own life choices or decisions keep you and your family in the same economic level. I can understand poverty because of injustice and corruption, but poverty is not always due to poor people being fucked over or oppressed by others. They have a lot to blame themselves for. My 2 cents. "
'India is a land of hyper emotional people who blindly trust others. A land where you would see several time divorcees who never learned their lessons, marriages running for the sake of a non existent society, the rich scamming the poor at every turn. The biggest ever scammer in India is still seen on tv mouthing inanities and blaming everyone but himself. You, the educated lot know he’s a lying thief but what about the millions of people who trust him? He sleeps peacefully at night when he knows well that he failed his jobs promise and people still expect a turnaround of sorts. We, the pathetic losers will vote this megalomaniac once again in the hopes that he will set things right. It’s a sad world for the poor. They can’t trust anyone. One from their ilk became the PM of a country, but little do they know that their lives have not changed an iota. It takes mental arithmetic that literally heats up your head when you count the expenses that have incurred under massive inflation, but how many poor people are willing to calculate it and call out this thief for what he did? None. They would rather pray to their God to save them. They have no saviour, no one when their money runs out. And run out it will. The thief has not done anything to advance their cause, to give them some leeway to earn more and provide a better future for themselves and their family. Instead all they get to hear is that he is a chaiwallah and he’ll speak to them one on one on the radio to remind them that he’s “with them”'

I am simply stating that there is a difference in the social structure of the middle class/upper-middle class and the poorer section of the society.

'1. I moved into my apartment last year and there was a really bad bed bug infestation. The property management company was supposed to take care of it since it was their fault. However they put the blame on us. After much debate, they called the pest control and hosed down the apartment. The pest control were supposed to visit the apartment thrice but they came only once. No wonder we had another round of infestation in a few months and this time, we had to shell out 550$. Not to mention, we had informed them of this.\n2. The internet company Comcast asked for a deposit of 100$ since we did not have a credit card at that time.

In fact India is better than most places in the world. We have generational poverty in India. I have myself seen people struggle to come out of poverty and fail for more than 1 generation. No wonder people act the way they act.\n\nAt least where I live, one popular arrangement is to have housemaids etc to ask for a loan from the employers that is adjusted against their salaries for the next 6-7 months or so.

When you say you are not "street smart", it does not mean you have to be a shaana wheeler dealer. It means you know what is a scam and what is not. So when you say you do adequate research on the internet to see if something is a scam or not and thereby you safeguard yourself, you are by definiton, "street smart".\n\nI will still claim this has nothing to do with education and had everything to do with awareness and common sense and "having a good nose".

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Rs 7,000 cr spent on Ganga in 2 yrs without improvement: NGT** \n\n ______ \nNEW DELHI: The government has spent over Rs 7,000 crore in two years to cleanse the Ganga which still remains a "serious enviromental issue", the National Green Tribunal said today as it issued a slew of directives including banning all construction activity within 100 metres of the river edge.In a detailed judgement, the tribunal also prohibited dumping of waste within 500 metres from the river, ordering that every offender would be liable to pay a penalty of Rs 50,000 per default."There are considerable unutilised funds as of today, besides the huge funds that have been made available under the national project as declared by the Prime Minister wherein Rs 20,000 crore have been allocated for the five years commencing 2015-2020."Even after spending Rs 7304.64 crores upto March, 2017, by the Central Government, State Government and local authorities of the State of UP, the status of river Ganga has not improved in terms of quality or otherwise and it continues to be a serious environmental issue," the NGT said.The order, running into 543 pages, said "till the demarcation of floodplains and identification of permissible and non-permissible activities by the state government of this judgement, we direct that 100 meters from the edge of the river would be treated as no development/construction zone between Haridwar to Unnao in UP.""No-development zones" are areas where no construction including commercial or residential buildings can come up.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar directed all concerned authorities to commence the work of setting up of sewage treatment plants and installation of anti-pollution devices within four months and complete it within two years.Welcoming the order, noted environmentalist and lawyer M C Mehta, on whose petition the verdict was pronounced, demanded a CBI probe into the spending of over Rs 7000 crore by the Centre and state government in cleaning the 500 km stretch of the Ganga.In the order, the NGT said all projects referred to in its verdict should be finalised by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and said that primarily it would be the responsibility of Ministry of Water Resources and NMCG to finalise these projects out of the available funds.Regarding shifting of tanneries located in Jajmau cluster in Kanpur , the bench sought an action plan from the leather units within six weeks, failing which "the UP government shall be duty bound to close the tanneries and shift the same to Banthar, Unnao or any other developed site which it considers appropriate."The NGT directed regulation of activities on banks of the Ganga and its tributaries and ordered UP and Uttarakhand governments to formulate guidelines for religious activities on the ghats during festivals.On the issue of maintaining the flow of the river, the tribunal directed that the minimum environment flow should not fall "below 20 per cent of the average monthly lean season flow."It also imposed a complete prohibition on disposal of municipal solid waste, e-waste or bio-medical waste on the floodplains or into the river and its tributaries.The tribunal reiterated its earlier order of ban on mechanical mining in Ganga and said "no in-stream mechanical mining is permitted and even the mining on the flood plain should be semi-mechanical and preferably more manual.""Such mining should be permitted only after a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the annual replenishment of sand and gravel in the river bed and ensuring that the longitudinal and lateral connectivity of the river is not disturbed and that only quantity less or equal to the annual replenishment is permitted to be removed from the river bed or its banks," it said."The industries shall contribute finances not exceeding 25 per cent of the total cost in relation to the construction, upgradation of sewage treatment plant, common effluent treatment plant and providing common infrastructure.Till the works on the projects in accordance with the judgement are commenced, "the NMCG and/or any other funding Ministry would not incur any expenditure on any projects in the States of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh relating to cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries falling in the segment between Gaumukh to Unnao," it said.The NGT held that all the industrial units falling in the catchment area of Ganga and its tributaries should not be permitted to indiscriminately extract ground water and asked Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) to carry out the study and notify areas falling between Haridwar and Unnao as "over exploited, critical, semi-critical and safe zone.""There shall be complete prohibition on extraction of groundwater in the critical areas... Extraction of groundwater should be subject to the CGWA granting permission for such extraction, and that too, only after ensuring that such permission is granted after rigorous water use assessment by the industry...," it said.The NGT also appointed a supervisory committee, headed by the secretary of the Water Resources Ministry and comprising IIT professors and officials from UP government to oversee implementation of its directions."This committee shall oversee and supervise proper and effective implementation of all the projects under this judgement and will ensure providing of funds expeditiously and finally submit the implementation-cum-progress report to the tribunal every three months," it said.An implementation committee was also set up to provide details of the Ganga cleaning projects and the manner and methodology in which these should be implemented.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. \n\n ______ \n**Not a tragedy, it’s a massacre: Kailash Satyarthi on Gorakhpur hospital deaths** \n\n ______ \nNobel Peace Laureate Kailash Satyarthi expressed his outrage at the death of over 60 children in Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das Medical College’s hospital due to alleged lack of oxygen, saying it was not a tragedy but a clear case of massacre.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Satyarthi tore into the Uttar Pradesh government asking “is this what 70 years of freedom means for our children?”\n\n“Appeal to CM @myogiadityanath Ji. Your decisive intervention can correct decades of corrupt medical system of UP to prevent such incidents,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered a thorough probe into the matter and assured strict action against those who were involved in the alleged shortage of oxygen supply in the hospital.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Saturday after attending an emergency meeting chaired by the chief minister, Uttar Pradesh health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said Yogi had recently visited the hospital, but he was not informed by the authorities about any anomalies.\n\nState minister for medical education Ashutosh Tandon reiterated the same and said action will be taken after detailed probe on the matter.\n\n“The chief minister has given us proper instruction on this issue. We will leave for Gorakhpur soon and after details analysis of the situation will take further decision on the same,” Tandon said.\n\nEarlier in the day, the alleged disruption in the supply of liquid oxygen at the hospital claimed lives of three more children.\n\nThe shortage of oxygen allegedly led to encephalitis, which is a sudden onset inflammation of the brain, following which the children died.\n\nThe families of the children have claimed that the doctors were not treating them well and the hospital was not even providing the medicines which were required for the treatment.\n\nAs per the locals, though the hospital is supposed to provide free medical assistance, neither there is proper medical facility available nor are the patients provided free medicines.\n\nEarlier on Friday, it was reported that as many as 30 children lost their lives due to encephalitis in a span of 48 hours at the hospital.\n\nGorakhpur DM Rajeev Rautela said that the cause of the deaths at the BRD Hospital was the disruption in the supply of liquid oxygen and has further appealed to the suppliers to not cut the supply henceforth.\n\nFollowing this report, the Uttar Pradesh Government jumped in defence of the medical college, while also assuring that the district magistrate has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident and the report will be out in 24 hours.\n\n“There haven’t been any deaths due to lack of oxygen supply. And ‘only’ seven children have died today. Today three deaths happened in Neonatal ICU, two due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) and two due to Non-AES,” UP medical education minister Ashutosh Tandon said.\n\n“The district magistrate has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. The report will be out in 24 hours,” he added.\n\nHe further said that the arrangement of oxygen cylinders was duly made and a strict action will be taken against those responsible for the mishap.\n\nAccording to data procured from the BRD hospital, in past five days - from August 7 to August 11, a total of 60 deaths have occurred in the hospital.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"This is not hinduism - it is hindutva. ***Hindutvam is the dysfunctional, retrograde fundamentalist form of Vaishnavite Hinduism***. Just like Jihadism is the convulated fundamentalist form of Islam or like Khalistanis are the fundamentalists of the Sikh. \n\nEvery religion has fundamentalists, and they all have one thing in common - they are insecure, indulge in fear mongering, and not accepting of others and don't shy from using violence to shove their ideas down the throat. \n\nWe indians need to recognize that our fight is not between hindus or muslims or sikhs or christians - but with the sanghis or jihadi or nazis or khalistanis.\n\nRecognize that when a Sanghi does or says something, he is not a hindu speaking for the hindus. Nor is a Jihadi a muslim speaking for islam. \n\nOur fight is against all these fundamentalists - whatever religion they claim to be trying to save - who do not like our way of life. As such, every Hindu should stand by a muslim when a jihadi attacks anyone, and so should the muslims stand by every hindu when a sanghi attacks anyone of them."
'Hinduism was created for one purpose only - for a small group of people (Brahmins) to oppress and subjugate other groups of people. Hinduism has always been a tool of oppression and subjugation for majority of its history. The Hinduism that we know today is a modern invention brought about reforms of people such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy in the 19th century. \n\nAnd even then, with the great popularity pre-19th century versions of Hinduism such as Hindutva enjoy today in India - it can be argued that the majority of Hindus are still not reformed to practice a modern version.\n\nLook at the scriptures for example - we cherry pick the good scriptures. For example, we will read all the Vedas but ignore the Manusmitri despite it being an important text of Hindu history. Even when we read the "good scriptures", we will ignore the bad parts of this such as this line from the Rig Veda which advocates murder for killing cows\n\n> "One who partakes of human flesh, the flesh  of a horse or of another animal, and deprives others of milk by slaughtering  cows, O King, if such a fiend does not desist by other means, then you should  not hesitate to cut off his head."'
'> \n> This Hinduism is so different from what I learned from the scriptures.\n\nWell, Hinduism is heterogeneous. There is no one common flow there. This sort of radical, extremist and violently dangerous Hinduism is also a part of it I would think. '
"When the state misuses irrelevant laws to terrorize its citizens, does it matter whether you get counted amongst the targets of current terrorism?\n\nHere's a bit of a blast from the past, so you can learn from history:\n\nFirst they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a Socialist.\n\nThen they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a Trade Unionist.\n\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—\nBecause I was not a Jew.\n\nThen they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\n-- Martin Niemöller"

At least in UP, although with Hindutva leader Modi as PM it could be argued that its countrywide.\n\nAnd finally, we need to realize that the fundamental problem is with religion - an outdated concept for the 21st century. It has served its purpose (if it ever had one except be responsible for billions of pointless deaths) and now needs to die and be replaced with atheism and humanism. \n\n'

"It's almost like the mentality of a slave who has been beaten so brutally that their sense of reality is clouded. Americans suffer from this to an extent; especially parts of the white working class. It's sad to see poor people who have completely resigned to their fate - on the other hand if they don't they'll probably become suicidal or criminal.\n\nWhat's weirder in the American version is that the blue collar class actually believes that one day they'll become a CEO. So they end up siding with scam artists and the absolute worst kind of corporate lobbies like the Koch brothers who have fed them ancap lies. Now people like Trump who's part of the very establishment that got them where they are feed them lies that he'll bring back all the jobs (never going to happen because of modern technology and secondary channels), and other lies about terrorists and criminal migrants who frankly do not care about the existence of some rural middle American worker living in Wisconsin or Minnesota. But scapegoats and rhetoric sell well.\n\nIn India I'd chalk this up mostly to ignorance. Most people simply cannot afford to travel abroad and the few that do either have to stay in a bubble or are dazed in a sort of culture shock.\n\n\nImho we shouldn't be glorifying this, even in jest. I'll give you a really sad anecdote: I've heard of maids that not only live like rats and are beaten up by their husbands on a regular basis; they're forced to work every waking second of their life. To the point of not even being able to go to the toilet for a wee - to save time they just urinate while walking on the railway tracks. They can't even afford to properly wash their clothes so they smell - just imagine how embarrassing it is for them. They have to eat trash food like discarded chicken skin, food that's often slightly rotten or husk to keep themselves full somehow. In extreme cases they eat weeds [or even grass](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/in-drought-hit-uttar-pradesh-the-poor-are-eating-rotis-made-of-grass-1252317). Independence and neo-liberal reforms haven't been good for everyone; while free markets are a net positive for the economy - the benefits have to percolate downwards. America made the mistake of not doing that and is paying with Trump - if India ignores the poor for too long there might be a revolution. Or at the very least a dangerous rise in crime.\n\n\nThis is the ghastly level of poverty we have in India that people fail to see. People need to understand why anti-incumbency and populism are such powerful political forces in India: this is why."

Not taking anything away from the first government in 70 years that thought of implementing them. \n\n(And just to piss trolls, despite the fact that a world-class economist was at the helm of affairs for 10 years previously, and this wasn't even a contentious/political reform.)\n\nPlaces where there is a real scope of difficult reform, like GST and truly-free movement of goods across state borders, is something this government is still struggling with. Not to say it's their fault, they need to bring all states on board, given the nature of constitutional rights on taxation.\n\nSame thing with stuff like construction permits.

'In what universe was killing an 80 year old Gandhi necessary?'
"Supremacist thinking is fairly normalized in India sadly. Either along caste lines, or region, or religion. Gandhi and Nehru were idealists, and always thought that an educated elite would be able to lead the country forward under a secular constitution. Sadly this gradually just fell apart and the old elite politicians became deeply corrupt. What replaced them were populist thugs, who are much like modern-day feudal lords. So the real face of India was let loose.\n\nThings will probably get worse until the average Indian learns to be a part of the civilized modern world and actually understands how secular humanist ideals are better for everyone.\n\nTo add to this, India never really faced the shock of WW2 so the dangers of majoritarian violence and fascism aren't there. The far-right in western countries, even under Trump is still fringe. In India it's mainstream. Similarly the cold war legacy never really impacted India, so fear of authoritarianism or appreciation of human rights never really developed.\n\nThe BJP and the Sangh are really just a symptom, not necessarily the cause. Perhaps they did open the jar where all the communal hatred was bottled up. Of course the congress has never done enough to curb right wing extremism, and at times encouraged it (Ayodhya). But the BJP takes this to another level."
"I don't know how old you are or where you have lived in India, but during throughout the 90s, minority appeasement was THE norm by congress at all levels (especially the state levels). Hell, does noone remember the raise in OBC quota in iim/aiims in 2004 and the riots and protests that followed? The majority voice which was usually frowned upon as too right wing/pro hindutva by the media took over the political narrative in the late 2000s as the UPA started crumbling and the Modi train kept chugging ahead. It came to a tipping point during the 2014 elections when the incredible propaganda wing of BJP/RSS used social media to their benefit and spread the feeling of 'Hindu pride' or 'persecution complex'.\n\nHistorically speaking, no one used to give a shit about the majority in the 80s because the votes were guaranteed for INC. It was the norm. They had so many cult like figures that it was only the swing voters of minority that needed to be canvassed for. It was the masjid incident that started it all to realise even the majority needs to be included in policy making decisions, resulting in the 2014 elections and the mainstreaming of right wing. "

'This is Muslims speaking out against a terrorist. Literally what most people claim to want to see. FFS, it\'s not like the UN gives a fuck about a thousand random Muslims clerics. The press release is the point of the press release - it *is* the action being taken. \n\nIt\'s not to "show a religion in a good light." It\'s an attempt to stem the ill-informed tide of "oh but why don\'t Muslims condemn" tards.'
"Who downvotes an actions taken against JuD?\n\nCan't think of anyone except the crowd that keeps complaining about Muslims all being terrorists."
"No both are incorrect that's why I oppose idea of religion but this religion doesn't want to adapt. They don't want to change with the time & that's true."
"They are trying to rebrand themselves. Market themselves. That's called propaganda. I'm not going to respect people for doing something good then shouting about it on every corner or telling everyone that he did it irrespective of their religion.\n\nI see it as Indians asking for punishment for a Pakistani nutjob who attacked their country on religious & political grounds & killed hundreds while causing billions in damage. This is unworthy of news. If they want to change world's view about Islam, they need to be progressive & little liberal. Fundamentalism on a mass scale won't change it or gain sympathy.\n\n\nI hate all the criminals but some are worse, aren't they ?"

You want Muslims to hate India so that you get an excuse to hate them back, fucking pathetic.\n\n>> FWIW, Nationalists would hate a terrorist like Hafiz Saaed and Pakistan from their core. So, please carry on your circlejerk somewhere else.\n\n----\n\n> that's why you're so butthurt\n\nNow you start making presumptions and again moving away from the topic.\n\n> I was calling out people downvoting YOUR post\n\nAnd I was calling you out for your false sense of outrage and presumptions.\n\n> WTF is going on.\n\nYes, create more outrage and circlejerk when you can't debate with nuance."
">It is the action being taken.\n\nI don't agree with this line. "
"No, I usually don't vote on threads that don't fit my bigoted worldview. I downvote either troll low effort posts or those where people complain about downvoting."
"People downvote anything. If they've already read that article or it does not interest them, they downvote. If it's posted by someone who they had an argument with, they downvote. An anonymous online community does not need good reasons to downvote posts :-)"
"> I see it as Indians asking for punishment for a Pakistani nutjob who attacked their country on religious & political grounds & killed hundreds while causing billions in damage\n\nBut you yourself claimed that they (Indian Muslims) wouldn't, in a thread about an article where they had actually claimed. Talk about hypocrisy.\n\n> I hate all the criminals but some are worse, aren't they ?\n\nWho is the worse criminal here? Hafiz Saeed or these people who wrote to UN? And why are you equating them to the crimes of Hafiz Saeed? I find your anger/hatred misplaced. That's all."
"My butt does hurt, there's a little pimple on it which is making sitting awkward."
"> I never said they wouldn't\n\nI am quoting you verbatim below: \n\n> Only people on one particular religion comes under the scrutiny & a well deserved one because people following that religion puts religion over nation\n\n.\n\n>  One criminal is trying to adapt, progress with society & improve \n\nI don't see any religion trying to do that actually. They all deserve the same ridicule. Punishment ofcourse is dependent on the crime. I agree that Islamists are more radical than others but that doesn't automatically make other religions more progressive."

"Word!\n\nAnecdote time: A while ago, I decided to make a couple of videos for men on interacting(as in if you're interested) with women in India. It was a conversational thing, I wasn't aiming on being recognized as a subject matter expert, nor do I consider myself a 'player', but I learned the hard way so thought it would be beneficial for the average Indian dude to get some advice. It wasn't even pickup advice or about approaching women, it was just stuff that any gentleman should know, and how to make dating a pleasant experience for yourself and for the woman.\n\nI was mauled so badly in the comments that I GTFO. It was hilarious, it felt like going to a Vidharbha village and talking about expensive Swiss cheese. Every internet attack possible was carried out in the comments section - I was criticized for my suggestions, my appearance, my accent, my clothes, my room, someone said I had semen stains everywhere, someone wanted to wallop my head with a black man's penis, some guy even mentioned he mailed the HR of my company because he was so aggravated by what I said.\n\nI decided to delete everything that day. Not because I was scared, or upset. Honestly it was an amusing experience. \n\n\nIt's because I realized that Indian dudes don't want to change. They don't want to learn how to approach women - they just want their delusional world to come true. They want a weird perverted world where these fucked up beliefs actually come true. \n\n\nIt's the only version of their existence, where they get to succeed."
"I know a guy from Mumbai (friend of a friend) who's a pickup artist. He claims to have had sex with around 60+ women - most of them he met through Tinder and Shaadi.com, but also a lot he met via cold approaches in public. Well, sounds astonishing huh? But this is only what he tells openly. What he has not told many of us is that he has been rejected hundreds of times, slapped by many women, beaten up by the women's husbands or brothers, beaten up by policemen and had to spend 3 days in jail... just for approaching women in public.\n\nThis is the harsh truth that no PUA will openly admit to anyone, and frankly no sane man will want to take such a risk to become a PUA."
'Indian society divides women into two classes:\n\n1)tradional / "good girl" /"innocent"\n\n2) whore\n\nCategory 2 : The signs may include applying makeup, wearing skirts or jeans, lack of dupatta, staying out after dusk, talking to opposite sex, alcohol consumption, smoking, in a relationship or rejecting "romantic" proposals form "simple guys" . \nPlus the mindset that all women are "matlabi" and that only "kameena" guys get the girls.

'This happens far too often for contractual roles in US. My manager has caught 2-3 such cheats before. Many major Silicon Valley companies  have stopped Skype interviews for contractors. But this is still a major problem in other parts of US. These cheats should be exposed, arrested for fraud and deported back to India. Genuine candidates suffer due to such people. \n\n\nGood job OP.'
'Being emotionally detached from the situation at work is an admirable quality, I agree.        \n\nI guess my expectation came from watching the examination invigilators back in my school/college days. Most of them became furious when someone got caught cheating, almost as if it was a personal insult at them.        '
'And letting other employer get duped for this act is not good? People like these are the reasons we have to go for interviews to different cities instead of getting it done over Skype. We can\'t even apply outside without being considered a fraud. Indian CV is by default on the "maybe if we are desperate" pile everywhere outside India. Letting acts like this not have repercussions is harming chances of everyone else. That asshole will get a job in another company over you or me or someone else like us. So, tell me, what is your preferred option. You or me vs the asshole who is faking every single thing to dupe a company into giving him a job.'
"And preach professionalism. It's sad to see him record this on a phone and put the video on YouTube. Disgraceful if you ask me. If I catch a candidate lying or cheating, l'll report to my supervisor and move on. This is not the way to raise awareness."
"I believe there is a lot of passive aggressive thing going on. Given how calm the person is after catching the lip sinking, would tell you that he did not take this kind of professional misconduct very seriously. But then he goes and upload that on the internet, maybe to get back at the person. This basically means he is passive aggressive and mental as fuck. I have worked with people like him, not the best folks to work with. \n  \nAnd if he is not passive aggressive, then he is just a *classic* sociopath, person who lack empathy whatsoever under certain situations (as per psychological [definition](http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/15850/1/Characteristics-of-a-Sociopath.html)), and would not think for a second that uploading this video might ruin someone's career.\n  \nIn summary, OP (assuming you are the *one*), you need mental heath consultation.\n  \nLet le downvotes begin."

"I once interviewed a lady who took about 10-15 seconds to answer each question but they were all right but I felt that something is wrong\n\nI requested for a Skype interview and during this interview, she failed to answer the exact same questions that she'd previously answered correct"
'After second thoughts, I do agree with you. That guy was a chutiya for trying to scam his way into a job. This could have been his first time doing this and now he might not do it ever again. \n\nBut the thing is now that the video is online and could potentially go viral it will make things difficult for him even if he tries to be genuine in the next interviews. Uploader should have at least blurred his eyes to make it a bit anonymous.'
"The only mistake he did was filming it vertically instead of horizontal. He didn't name him or shame him. He even gave good advice and let him go light."

"It is quite justifiable. Though Gandhi spoke for upliftment of dalits, he never supported or asked anyone to renounce caste system. While seperate electorate was allowed for Sikhs and Muslims, he fasted against Dalit electrorate, which finally lead to *Poona Pact* between him and Ambedkar. The *Harijan Sevak Sangh* didn't allow any dalit representation, for which Gandhi retorted with a logic of it being Hindu's burden and their forgiveness act for atricities against Dalits.\n\nGandhi had this weird fixation on religion and sin and purity that many logics were clouded by them. But these shouldn't let anyone ignore his role in mass mobilization of freedom struggle and non violent fight against British. We are so onesided in our arguments that we tend to forget that everyone has their shortcomings."
'There\'s more to it than what most are suggesting here. While Ambedkar has come to be seen as a pan-Indian Dalit icon now, in fact in the pre-Independence era he was only one of several leaders in the Dalit community. Ambedkar was the undisputed head of the Dalits in the former Bombay Presidency, and especially of the Mahar community. But in UP and Bihar, among other places, many of the main Dalit leaders were firmly in the Gandhian camp, which infuriated Ambedkar. \n\nThat being said, while Ambedkar\'s comments seem harsh and aggressive, I\'m personally more sympathetic to him because Gandhi\'s view of caste (among other things) was incredibly condescending. I mean he also said that the Jews should stay in Germany and endure "voluntary suffering" at the hands of the Nazis. \n\nEdit: Also, just to add--this TIL would not be a big problem if people stopped trying to make heroes out of historical figures. Gandhi, Ambedkar, Mother Teresa...people try to forget that they were people, not saints. Stop trying to make gods out of people and then you won\'t be disappointed when you learn Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and Mother Teresa had the sick suffer like Christ on the cross while getting world-class medical treatment for herself.'
'What was the problem between them? '
"Ambedkar was overshadowed by Gandhi, no doubt. But I do not see them as being on opposite sides. Had both learned to work together, the Dalits would have benefited infinitely more. Gandhi was not as casteist as Ambedkar had him portrayed. The problem was, Ambedkar could not foresee a humane Hinduism and Gandhi's entire world rested on that concept.\n\nI wish they had worked together, though. "
"If you read Gandhi's own bio, he comes off as an asshole. When his wife was sick, he was advised to give goat milk if he wanted her to survive and he declined. The day his father died, he had been having sex with her. He just comes off as a terrible person no matter how you cut it. He was a racist against blacks. He slept naked with his friend's granddaughter.\n\n\n\n"
'What a dick'
">On the other hand, converting to other religions has not helped Dalits throw off the yoke of oppression.\n\nI would argue that they face lesser caste-ism inside their converted religion than they would have if they didn't convert. Infact, the caste-ist bigotry is simply spreading out of Hinduism into the convert population. But now they become subject to religion-based prejudice from some Hindus. "
">Ultimately both Gandhi and Ambedkar were proved wrong. Hinduism has, as of now not yet let go of caste completely proving that Gandhiji was being too optimistic. On the other hand, converting to other religions has not helped Dalits throw off the yoke of oppression. Sometimes, they face discrimination in their new religions as well.\n\nThis is a feel good falsity. Hinduism has not let go of caste at all and it still dominates the lives of the vast majority of Indians, whereas many of those who convert do escape violent caste barbarism, and most of the caste intimidation they do face is from Hindus enraged at their conversion. Ambedkar was completely correct and trying not to upset people by propping up Gandhi's nonsense is intellectually dishonest."
'> I mean he also said that the Jews should stay in Germany and endure "voluntary suffering" at the hands of the Nazis.\n\n*That* will be considered okay as proof of his flawed thinking but dare somebody remind how he told Hindus not to run for their lives from bloodthirsty rioters during the Mapilla rebellion but bare their chests to the swords of their persecutors with a smile to win them over - all hell breaks loose here!'
'Oh God, these thoughts on Jews of Gandhi are completely new to me. And now I think he was a bigger fool. Put forward the other side of your face when slapped once but do not resort to violence was a stupid idea but still tolerable. But this whole "voluntary suffering" by the Jews is just an excruciating thought which can only come from a mad man. It directly goes against Peace, human rights and Dignity. MK Gandhi was a man of skewed and distorted ideas, idk how were to be accepted by millions around the world and are respected still! '
"It centers mainly around the Poona pact I think, Ambedkar ofc disagreed with Gandhi on how to deal with the dalit issue, but what vexed him the most is how Gandhi pretty much blackmailed him into accepting the Poona pact by threatening to fast to the death. \n\nCan you imagine what Gandhi's death or debilitation would have done ? It would have forever tainted Ambedkar and the dalit community for being the cause of Gandhi's death, the issue of emancipation of the dalits would have been lost at least for the immediate future, and even if there were to be some action taken in the matter, Ambedkar would have no role to play in it. \n\nIt is a ruthless thing to do, but Gandhi was in a way ruthless, both to himself and to others. He was also a shrewd and cunning politician and a truly great organiser and mass leader."
'Topic - Ambedkar & Gandhi tussle. Caste system and differences of opinion between two great man. \n\nMotivation - OP learned it today. OP is probably very young and still learning.

'He also ate meat, smoked and tried to commit suicide. This was all when he was a teenager and almost all of us have done dumb things as a teenager. Still, to me he comes off as brutally honest and very critical of himself.'
'He changed his views against blacks later in life. He even said he felt guilty for this and mentioned in his autobiography about his change in views. '
'Ambedkar changed to Buddhism, and denounced Hinduism and was a harsh critic of the relegion, he also criticized RSS, completely opposite of an ideal bhakt. '
"This is an important point. Another important point is the visibility they have got. There are a lot of dalit based organisations going around,  naturally  some of them are shitty. I wonder whether they could've had so much voice without the likes Ambedkar. "
'That word *Harijan* is also evidence of the battle between Gandhi and Ambedkar.  \n\nAmbedkar hated that word. Absolutely despised it, found it condescending. As the stature of Ambedkar in post independence India has grown (partly cause with time people have been able to appreciate his thoughts more and partly due to the fact that present day dalit leaders like Mayawati are mired in corruption issues) his ideas on what should/should not be good/acceptable for the Dalits (from terminology used to refer to them to their means/methods of political agitation) has become gospel.    \n  \nHe disliked the word. So most Dalits do [too](http://www.thehindu.com/2003/09/28/stories/2003092802010500.htm)\n  \n For many Dalits, Ambedkar has reached near *demigod* status. His statue is found in most Dalit colonies/ghettos and his pictures are often treated near reverentially in Dalit homes.  \n  \nFor a man, who hated the concept of [hero worship](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Netas-ignore-Ambedkars-dislike-for-hero-worship/articleshow/51871214.cms) this is maybe his biggest defeat. His followers doing the very thing he cautioned society against doing, repeatedly.'
'I need more source on this? I thought he got killed because a separate muslim state was carved out of India?'
'Too little too late. Any old man can declare himself a champion of righteousness when he has no sacrifice left to be made for it. Dying when its already past your time to die, whether of a bullet or a heart attack, is not a sacrifice.'
'Interestingly enough, this is one of the things that Amebdkar harshly criticized Gandhi for. \n\nDescribing the Mopla rebellion in his 1946 book, Ambedkar says:\n> what baffled most was the treatment accorded by the Moplas to the Hindus of Malabar. The Hindus were visited by a dire fate at the hands of the Moplas. Massacres, forcible conversions, desecration of temples, foul outrages upon women, such as ripping open pregnant women, pillage, arson and destruction- in short, all the accompaniments of brutal and unrestrained barbarism, were perpetrated freely by the Moplas upon the Hindus until such time as troops could be hurried to the task of restoring order through a difficult and extensive tract of the country. The number of Hindus who were killed, wounded or converted, is not known. But the number must have been enormous.\n\nThen, specifically describing Gandhi\'s response to the Mopla rebellion and the Khilafat movement, Ambedkar is once again critical:\n> Mr. Gandhi has been very punctilious in the matter of condemning any and every act of violence and has forced the Congress, much against its will to condemn it. But Mr Gandhi has never protested against such murders [of Hindus]. Not only have the Musalmans not condemned these outrages, but even Mr Gandhi has never called upon the leading Muslims to condemn them. He has kept silent over them. Such an attitude can be explained only on the ground that Mr Gandhi was anxious to preserve Hindu-Moslem unity and did not mind the murders of a few Hindus, if it could be achieved by sacrificing their lives...This attitude to excuse the Muslims any wrong, lest it should injure the cause of unity, is well illustrated by what Mr Gandhi had to say in the matter of the Mopla riots. The blood-curdling atrocities committed by the Moplas in Malabar against the Hindus were indescribable. All over Southern India, a wave of horrified feeling had spread among the Hindus of every shade of opinion, which was intensified when certain Khilafat leaders were so misguided as to pass resolutions of "congratulations to the Moplas on the brave fight they were conducting for the sake of religion". Any person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Moslem unity. But Mr Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity of establishing Hindu-Moslem unity that he was prepared to make light of the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafats who were congratulating them. He spoke of the Moplas as the "brave God-fearing Moplas who were fighting for what they consider as religion and in a manner which they consider as religious.\n\nIt\'s hard for me sitting in 2017 to judge Gandhi\'s political decisions in those turbulent times. But it can be seen that even his contemporaries at the time found these actions disturbing.'
"Oh man that sucks. Recently dalits were poisoned to death the other day. It's fucked up."
"Ambedkar Gandhi tussle is meaningless without context of caste & Hinduism - there was no personal enmity between the two\n\nI've never said what I said to deride OP or anyone else - I've clarified it in my comment itself!\n\nAgain Sangh & Golwakar & RSS are very much relevant here as you can see from my comment.\n\nYou got it wrong my friend, Truth must prevail."

'1. No, he knew nothing about medicine and basically denied her what could have saved her. Sexist and egotistic behaviour.\n\n2. Agreed.\n\n3. Wrong.

"That's because most converts tend to be from lower caste Hindus themselves. So you don't see that much casteism. "
"[1](http://www.academia.edu/326347/Changes_in_Mahatma_Gandhi_s_views_on_caste_and_intermarriage),[2](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=shCQVfWixiAC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=gandhi%27s+views+on+harijans+marriage&source=bl&ots=QaQjosBbRd&sig=JOnlUaoGWvEqqLf1m5ejkl46qGE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu4PO_uI_WAhUDS48KHej5Ajg4ChDoAQhIMAk#v=onepage&q=gandhi%27s%20views%20on%20harijans%20marriage&f=false), M.K. Gandhi supported caste to hilt till 1946, it was when he found it impossible to reform that he went against it. Remember that while Hindu Mahasabha did not approve of the formation of Paksitan, it did agree to the 2 nation theory and did the best of its effort to introduce it and keep it alive in India politcs. Killing of Gandhi did not bring back the Muslims to India. But it did stop Gandhi from virtually distroying caste. That was the one thing he did, that found equal enmity within and outside the political class of that day. The assassination itself wasn't the first attempt, why is it that state did nothing to protect him? He died not when defending Muslims, but when attacking caste system. Ambedkar's anger is justified, because it was M.K. Gandhi who kept introducing caste system back into the political agenda of freedom movement."

"I read a lot of stories in the past few years of older muslims lamenting the turn to radicalisation of their youth. There was an article the other year where an old Mumbaite wrote about how the city is much more segregated than 30-40 years ago.\n\nWorse, the explosion of Islamic radicalism in WB is an outgrowth of a similar phenomenom in Bangladesh. Pakistan used to be isolated in that, but now we're seeing the same winds spread to Bangladesh and then creeping into WB.\n\nKerala also has big problems with this. I don't know when this started, but it seems to be accelerating in the last 15 years or so. Typically, the young are more liberal than their elders, but we're seeing the opposite pattern here."

According to your reasoning mayavati must be a feminist for becoming a chief minister\n\nI wish more Indian men would aware that feminism is **GOOD** for them.  Women are also some of the worst offenders as upholders of patriarchy and medieval gender norms.  Like seriously, if your wife gets an education and enters the workforce that\'s less pressure and stress on you as a man to be the "provider" of the family. \n\nInstead, every time a woman acts like a bitch toward a man its label as feminism.\n'

'Well if those women act entitled and use feminist terms and language and call themselves feminists and act shitty to men then yes they will bring a bad name to their ideology. Just like terrorists bring a bad name to islam (not a perfect example but you know what I am trying to say) \nEveryone is a representative of their ideology so they need to act accordingly.\n\nOh and I disagree. Feminism is currently VERY BAD for men. Feminism is not designed with the feelings of men so it doesn\'t inherently care about men and never has. But that is ok. Except that now it\'s got to a point where it blames men for everything and penalizes them unjustly. What\'s worse is that  the system is colludes with it in fucking men over because it\'s more profitable. It\'s become greedy.\n\nObviously such a toxic feminist trend is more prevalent in more feminized liberal countries like Sweden and USA than in India. But it\'s spreading here. Look at the rohtak girls.thats just one example that the media put out when the girls were saying they got molested or some shit but practically no follow up when they were proven to be lying. The system in collusion\n\nFeminism also perpetrates the idea that females are weak/always the victims/incapable of taking responsibility for their actions/incapable of consenting when it comes to criminal acts where women are involved while saying the opposite as a cultural narrative. It also perpetrates the idea that all womens problems are because of men and that men are bad and evil and are responsible for their actions and also for women\'s. Go to r/mensrights and check out the various news articles posted that commit atrocities on men. Men get falsely accused of rape and don\'t get justice because it is assumed that they are guilty even before any trial begins. In most cases when it\'s found that the women were lying, they get a slap in the wrist while the men have their lives ruined.\nWomen also get leniency when charged with the same crime like sex with a minor. Apparently when it\'s a boy the boy was "asking for it" and should be held responsible for his actions. There are many such hypocritical instances.\n\nMostly it\'s the political correctness and curbing of language and thoughts and ideas that one has to do with the increase in feminist ideology that angers me personally. And if disagree with women or think that men and women aren\'t the same or that women aren\'t better than men, then yr a sexist and a misogynist. These labels are thrown around so casually to shame men or people who think differently. People loose their jobs and their ability to make a living because of social ostracisation like how exactly a group of females operate.\n\nMake no mistake, feminism is a toxic ideology that is now a politically and financially motivated agenda of hate spreading false logic like the gender wage gap which has been debunked but still hasn\'t stopped feminists from going on about it. \n\nNow obviously this is not the kind of crazy in india yet. We do need to uplift women especially in rural area but that can be done through help, better laws and education rather than a toxic ideology. \n\nRemember, feminism started in the US when men went to fight a war to protect their women and their country. Literally feminism started on the corpses of men and women don\'t appreciate that history and the sacrifice of men. Women didn\'t achieve anything on their own, they have always needed help and there were always good men who stood up for women and fought for their rights to live and enjoy life. But now feminism has turned on the same men who are on their side.\n\nLook all ideologies are dust in the wind without people to enact or act of it behalf. Feminism as an ideology on paper is neither good nor bad. It\'s the people and their actions that give it a bad name. So maybe feminism is good by design but currently the feminists aren\'t and id rather not go along with it. Infact many of the original feminists hate the current crop of entitled females who act shitty on behalf of feminism.\n\nSorry about the rant'

CM Adityanath orders ‘grand’ Janmashtami in UP** \n\n ______ \nAt a time when Uttar Pradesh is mourning the death of over 60 infants in Gorakhpur, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed preparations for a “grand Krishna Janmashtami celebration”.\n\nIn a communique issued late on Sunday to the director general of police (DGP) Sulkhan Singh, Adityanath said: “Krishna Janmashtami is an important festival and the police should organise it in a traditional and grand way.”\n\nThis comes just days after over 60 children died at the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) medical college within a span of a week in the chief minister’s hometown and parliamentary constituency.\n\nAdityanath said that the festival celebrating the birth of Lord Krishna should be organised “with Indian traditions”.\n\nFollowing the diktat, DGP Singh has written to all district police chiefs, superintendents of police in the Railways and commandants of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) to adhere to the instructions.\n\nA state Department of Information and Public Relations (DIPR) statement said such celebrations that had been done away with earlier, were being revived.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) reacted sharply to the missive.\n\n“This is ironical, tragic and in some ways reflective of the mindset of powers that be... They will go ahead with their agenda even in the wake of tragedies of such magnitude,” said AAP spokesman Vaibhav Maheshwari.\n\nOther political leaders have also slammed the state government for the decision but refused to come on record, fearing backlash from “Hindu forces”.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

I hope she leaves him but she might compromise and her compromise is a harder one to make rather than that asshole's. Not because she would find it hard to shun mutton but because this asshole cares more about his potential embarrassment rather than his soul partner.\n\nAnd there's nothing morally wrong if someone eats mutton and it is not even injurious to anyone's health in the first place.

'> To this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.\n\n> “His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”\n\n> “Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.\n\n> “I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”\n\n[Zakia’s conspiracy angle ‘crumbled’ with Supreme Court verdict on Sanjiv Bhatt: Gujarat High Court](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/zakias-conspiracy-angle-crumbled-with-supreme-court-verdict-on-sanjiv-bhatt-gujarat-high-court-4878357/)\n\n> The Gujarat High Court order on the petition of late Congress MP Ahsan Jafri’s widow Zakia Jafri has said that one of the main pillars of allegations of a larger conspiracy in the 2002 post-Godhra riots has “crumbled” following the Supreme Court’s decision on former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt. “Much water has flown, as discussed at length, and one of the main pillars of the Protest Petition of Sanjiv Bhatt’s evidence has crumbled in wake of the decision of the apex court,” Justice Sonia Gokani wrote in the order pronounced on Thursday. The order was made available on Friday.\nAhsan Jafri was killed in the Gulberg Society massacre in Ahmedabad during the 2002 post-Godhra riots. Bhatt had claimed in the affidavit, filed nine years after the riots, that he was present in a meeting on February 27, 2002, at then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi’s residence. In its 2015 order, the SC had dismissed Bhatt’s petition seeking an independent probe into the FIR lodged at Ghatlodia police station, Ahmedabad, by police constable K D Panth.\n\n> Panth had alleged that he was forced to sign on an affidavit prepared by Bhatt to prove that the latter was present in the meeting at Modi’s residence. Justice Gokani observed that the apex court order revealed “how the unholy nexus of certain officers with certain other planners led to the apex court dismissing the petition of forming SIT for investigating into the crime registered at Ghatlodia police station.”\n\n> The court said, “His (Bhatt’s) handshakes with various agencies to influence the SIT and course of justice in the case of Ms Jafri also exponentially revealed the extent to which everything was planned. Various observations made by the amicus curiae in relation to presence of Bhatt in the meeting held by the then Chief Minister on 27.02.2002 have been quoted, in fact, in extenso in the order impugned….”'

'wait if this is okay, then why is it a problem when Shiv Sena or MNS does the same in Maharashtra?'
"I think this is unfair. \n\nI totally understand that you need to know Kannada if you're working in a bank in Karnataka because some people might not be comfortable with Hindi or English.\n\nBut, this should be in the job description and they should not employ people who can't speak Kannada to start with.\n\nOnce they're employed, you can't just ask them to learn Kannada else get fired."
'I have said it before. This outsiders must learn Kannada attitude is as dangerous as Hindi imposition.'
"This is the reason why I advocate people of a domicile state work in that state to avoid such problems. \n\nThere are multiple institutions, banks or even hospitals run by a single institution that can easily transfer employees amongst their own branches every few years to ensure that they retain productivity while maintaining the status quo in the language issue.\n\nEnough with this language imposition, be it Hindi or any regional language.

But dangling the sword of sacking people from their jobs over their heads is they don't learn the local language is bad in so many ways.\n\nIn a country as diverse as India, language is and always will be a barrier as we don't conform to a single language and never will.

Will they  I refuse to serve them if the interaction is kept in hindi ?\n We don't see this type of behaviour in other states. A Gujarati doesn't have to learn Marathi or Haraynvi or Bihari when they migrate to those states. Similarly, a Bihari or Marathi or other person doesn't necessarily have to learn Gujarati to work in firms/org based in Gujarat. This is just an example and fits almost every states of India. "
"Will they sponsor tuition and let the employees dedicate 1-2 hours daily to this endeavour(call it a professional training of sorts)?

Shouldn't you let the free market decide what processes private banks should adopt? If a bank has Kannada-speaking staff and the competition doesn't, people will automatically prefer that bank more. \n\nWhat if my target customer as a private bank is elite English-speaking urban crowd (a la Citibank)? You might call it elitist and snobbish, but how can you make it illegal?\n\nThis is a very dangerous territory for a linguistic group that complains about _imposition_ of an unnecessary language."

'Well, if North Indian states did the same with Hindi, there would be national outcry and a whining Opposition crying about Hindi imposition and rising intolerance and fascism.'
"Yes, but it doesn't need every employee of the bank to know the language. As long as there are enough people at the counters who can speak the langauage, there is no issue. Have you seen any local having a problem in the bank because the bank employee doesn't speak the local language? I have seen people having problems because they are illiterate and the bank, while providing forms in the local language, refuses to fill those out for them."

'You have to understand the context of this struggle. Have you seen the challans in SBI banks and have interacted with the staff in rural areas? I have. The challans are in English/Hindi and some employees just communicate in Hindi, by default. \n\nI experienced this shit in Mandya, Karnataka out of all places. Imagine a farmer in Mandya wanting to do a transaction in Kannada in SBI bank. He is lost from the beginning. Strangers are around who can help him, but why should a Kannadiga struggle to do business in Karnataka. That is the sort of environment that is being propagated here.'
'Bank employees I presume are selected from national tests. There will be chunk of Hindi speakers in there but its also very inconvenient that local customers have to know Hindi/English to converse with them. All in all the system is at fault because of our diversity. Think bank branches should make selections based on how much local/rural/national customers they get.'
'> This outsiders must learn Kannada attitude is as dangerous as Hindi imposition.\n\nNot the same really. Enforcing Kannada knowledge for someone working in Karnataka is analogous to enforcing Hindi knowledge for someone working in Uttar Pradesh. \n\nThe Hindi imposition on non-Hindi states is analogous to insisting that someone in Bihar learn Kannada or lose his job.

'At least demonetization and surgical strikes had an event around it. Farrago stands completely on its own.'
"I think you didn't watch the show in which case your confusion can be forgiven.\n\n> when he gave a sworn statement that he didn't.\n\nIn the show it was made clear that Tharoor had come back to the hotel and he had mentioned this to the police.\n\nThe trick Arnab was using was to half quote a statement given by some congress leader to the police. Apparently some congress leader had told the police that Shashi was attending a congress meeting the whole day which was partially true as attested by the journalist Saba Naqvi who had seen Shashi on the said stage.\n\nArnab was broadcasting this statement as the statement by Shashi Tharoor. And, insinuating that Shashi had lied to the police. He didn't. Rahul Eshwar who was apparently in contact with someone close to Shashi clarified that he had mentioned that he returned to the hotel in his statement to police. \n\nSo there is no doubt. He returned. \n\nThe logic here is that Shashi was defended by a bigger tribe than he would be usually defended by. Among his supporters were normal Tharorrians who would defend anything he would say or do. Then there were people who simply hate Arnab Goswami for some reason and then he was also defended by people who don't like media playing the role of judiciary. Was this tribe bigger than the tribe opposed to him. Not really. But from the perspective of Tharoor he is now considered an object of public sympathy by a heavier mass which is a good thing for him. Bhakts were also handicapped in their attack since the police investigating the crime is controlled by none other than BJP. "

'About the service charge thing, almost all the restaurants I have been to in Bangalore, have put a board outside saying "We charge service charge" and they say if you have a problem with that don\'t eat here.'
'I am going to play the devils advocate over here and put this up: \n\nA quote from the president of National Restaurants Association of India = "Guidelines on service charge not law" \n\nSource: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/58341250.cms\n\nTurns out he is right: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=156064\n\nThis has been misinterpreted and voiced everywhere. '
'but there\'s no direction to strictly NOT pay service charge either.."optional" doesn\'t mean anything..if a restaurant is charging, you can\'t deny that. Only thing Consumer Affairs deptt has said is- *"..consumers should be informed about service charge in the menu card itself and not in the bill"* and, *"..should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining experience, he/she can have it waived off."*'
">Don't be ashamed\n\n easier said than done"
"If they've made an entry in the bill for service charge you will have to pay GST on it. GST is a tax on goods and services. Nothing to see here. If you don't want to pay the service charge don't eat there. "
"This guy is talking through his ass. I'm in the F&B business. GST, just like all other taxes and levies before it, is on the total amount that includes bill + service charge. Go talk to a chartered accountant."
"From Bangalore itself, you can show them the notification from the government that says service charge isn't mandatory. \n\nI've asked for a revised bill without a service charge as I tip based on service. Not 10% flat. \n\nI usually tell this to them after I've finished eating and before I've asked for the bill. \n\nI often do this everytime the bills are more than 5k. I don't think its worth to pay someone 500 bucks to do their job. i leave a 200-250 tip at max."
'>Almost all restaurants and pubs in Delhi have put hugh signboards at entry saying that by dining in there, you are consenting to service charge.\n\nNope. Putting a signboard does not mean you are consenting to anything. If i put up a signboard in my restaurant that you cannot sit on chairs does not mean you consent to it. This is a stupid argument. \n\nIf you enter a place which says "we levy service charge" you still have the right to not pay it. '
'Refuse to pay. Becuase no one can deposit VAT / Service tax on bills generated after 30th June. Most likely scamming you.\n\nNote: Alchohol is not under GST so you will find VAT being charged on alcohol. '

"Now you guys are just being silly lol... I understand you all hate service charge (I do too) but doesn't mean you all have to get all irrational. "
"You dont know the difference between Service Tax and Service Charge. You are agreeing to pay the restaurant for the food. They cannot force you to pay a tip. That is upon you. What if you got bad service? Will you pay a tip for a bad experience? Service Charge is an after charge which inflates your bill for no reason. \n\n>It's a free country and if the restaurant wants to charge a service tax and is upfront about it, then you pay or don't dine there. Simple.\n\nI can shit on the streets too by your logic. "
'To avoid calculations, AFAIK, flat 40% of restaurant bills are assumed to be service costs, while the remaining 60% is assumed to be goods while calculating taxes. '
'and it\'s not mine, tell this to Consumer Affairs Deptt not me, they\'ve clearly said(and i guess you can\'t read)-  *"..should a customer be dissatisfied with the dining experience, he/she can have it waived off."*'
'Restaurants reserve the right to entry. Even if you consent to their service charge, you are still within your rights to deny paying it later. What if you got bad service or bad food? Would you still pay? Service Charge is a tip. Remember this. '
'Which is precisely why you have the right to not pay service charge and you can deny it. '
"I am shopping from him since past half decade. That's how he knows. \n\n>If the retailer is letting go of that margin then he/she is an idiot.\n\nHuh? You have no idea how business is done."
'Service charge is not a tip lol. If it was, it would be called "Tip" not "Service Charge".'
'Why? Where did you consent to prices? \n\nAre clubs with an entry fees also merely a suggestion? \n\nIs "right to admission" also merely a suggestion?\n\nIs "No arms and ammunition" also merely a suggestion?\n\nIs "Not outside eatables" also merely a suggestion?'

He narrated the series of events and he ran back to pick up Banu,” Patil claimed.\n> “But by the time he reached, the family members had set her on fire,” Patil said. **He claimed that two police officers reached the spot 10 minutes after Sayabanna did, as it took them some time to find the place.**\n\nIn this horrific story, there are more than one points to rage at. Why didn't the police accompany Sayabanna, with a few medics? Perhaps they could have saved her.\n\n> “Based on Sayabanna’s account, none of Banu’s neighbours came forward when he begged them for help. He says that they too were of the opinion that the girl had done a terrible deed and went inside their homes and locked the doors while Banu was being burnt. However, when we went to question the neighbours, they said that they did not see or hear anything and are not cooperating with the investigation,” an officer at the Talikote Police Station said.\n\nThe malice and the inhumane depravity of the religious is terrifying. Not only did the neighbors not step in to stop this diabolical act, they supported it and are not cooperating with the police."

From a far off place, it's quite easy to get a justice boner on, but even making the harshest example of the wrongdoers isn't gonna solve such evils and hence not serve meaningful justice to the victims. Because guess what, those people are very much aware of the consequences of their actions. They know that burning someone to death and cooperating on it is gonna land them in prison, might even get them a death sentence. Yet, they are desperate to the point to not care. They view their perceived slight to honor to be more damaging and sinful than everything else. And generations of being raised with toxic teachings makes them act out in such beastly fashion, while at other times they would seem like the most normal guys next door.\n\nUnleashing the wrath of the law will only make them martyrs. It won't cure the underlying social problems. That's something only education can solve. Sadly, it'll be slow process.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut that isn't to say that no steps should be taken. Just that one should consider how much net positive result an action will yield."

I don't think anybody has a problem in Arnab being a right wing intellectual if he wants to be, the problem is when you pretend to be a journalist and a neutral one at that.

'Just more Indian social engineering. Let everyone eat for fucks sake.'
'What the hell does "allowed" mean? Did these jokers dis-allow diabetic children in the past?\n\n'
"What's the justification for that? Diabetic children need it because of their condition, or else they won't function properly which is unfair. Others those who have no problem of blood sugar, can easily survive three hours without food."
'No, actually a normal human being should have no problem to survive 3 hours(or even 3 days) without food. The diabetic kids on the other hand will have to fight dropping blood sugar and crashing ability to think somewhere around the 2 hour mark, depending on how bad their condition is. It is only fair to let them snack so that everyone is on a leveled playing field, nobody does badly just because they have a condition.'
'That was decided on specific basis on the discretion of the invigilators. Now there is a provision that directly allows the student to eat if he/she could prove their illness'
'Holy crap. Your username dude. laughed my ass off for a min there. :D'
"Fucking hell, we weren't allowed shoes in the hall. Something about it being a potential cheat device.  "
"I think you're confusing diabetes mellitus with diabetes insipidus. Frequent urination is one of the characteristics of insipidus."
'In school, classes 7 and 10 used to have "Board Exams" conducted by the state school commission, they were strict. No piss break. Other than that school exams are pretty chill. In intermediate, piss breaks are allowed in exams conducted by the college. In engineering it\'s hold it or give up the exam. I had to hold it in for more than couple of exams for the last half an hour.'
"> No, actually a normal human being should have no problem to survive 3 hours(or even 3 days) without food.\n\nI would definitely black out and collapse if I didn't eat for 3 hours at a stretch.\n\n\\#bulking4eva"
'> The diabetic kids on the other hand will have to fight dropping blood sugar and crashing ability to think somewhere around the 2 hour mark, depending on how bad their condition is\n\nActually there is no "how bad their condition is" as far as type-1 diabetes goes (except for a small period right at the beginning). Type 1 means your pancreas stops producing insulin. Zilch, Zero. Your Type-1 does not get any worse once that happens.   \n\nAnd dropping blood sugar is not because of their type 1 diabetes but rather because of the treatment - which is injecting insulin. In normal people, the pancreas & the liver together control your blood sugar using a feedback loop - so that there is never an excess of insulin in your blood stream causing your blood sugar to drop. For type 1s, since their pancreas produces no insulin, they have inject to insulin - and since there is no feedback loop, you cannot always inject the precise amount needed & hence the blood sugar can drop.'
'Yeah, I was wearing Crocs and was asked to remove them. Dumb shit.'
'umm, I think thats a TN thing. Same experience even in CBSE schools of TN. No socks, no shoes, barefoot and no food.'
"That is before diagnosis & treatment. That's how it is diagnosed. The patient produces no insulin. His blood sugar is sky high & he has frequent urination & thirst etc. Once diagnosed, he is immediately put on insulin & then these symptoms typically go away if the dosage is right. And amount of insulin needed by type 1s is very small as compared to type 2s."
"What you say actually makes sense. We also need to emphasise, with rights one begets the burden of responsibilities. Say, if you were to pour your hot green tea on your answer scripts. You should own up to it, take a new sheet and do your best after that. You shouldn't  go to the invigilators with your extended family and cry to give u a chance because your future will be spoilt. I don't think that students in tenth and twelfth are usually that responsible. So, the invigilators don't want to deal with this shit. So their hall, their rules."
'They tried to hold an exam in a controlled environment to avoid cheating etc. The more you deviate, the more there are problems. You may want to have green tea. Someone else may want to do 10 push-ups every hour. Someone else may want to listen to some music in between. Someone may want to take a walk and stretch every hour etc.  \n'
"Sadly no. I didn't start taking academics seriously until higher secondary. I passed with average grades."
'What about the pee pee though?\n\n> The symptoms of type 2 diabetes due to high blood sugar may include:\n\n> Increased thirst\n\n> Increased hunger (especially after eating)\n\n> Dry mouth\n\n> Frequent urination\n\n> Unexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry)\n\n> Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)\n\n> Blurred vision\n\n> Headaches\n\n> Loss of consciousness (rare)\n\nSauce: http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/diabetes-warning-signs'

'There is some idiot in this thread going on and on about how Catholics are not Christians. Let me clarify a few things regarding Catholics\n\n1) Catholicism is the largest denomination of Christianity, and along with Orthodox Christians, make up the biggest group of Christians who have existed ever since Christ - The Apostolic Christians. \nProtestantism, Pentecostalism etc are newer varieties of Christianity that developed in the second half of the last millennium.\n\n \n2) Keralite Christians are mostly Catholic/Orthodox/Jacobite. Pentecostals and Protestants are fewer in number (CSI is the biggest protestant group). Christianity in kerala can be traced back to 2000 years. \n\nSo, bottom line is, Catholics are Christians. In fact, along with the Orthodox, you may even call them the "original" Apostolic Christians. '

He said a police vehicle and five cops were on the spot, but none of them helped. "My father called me up... When I reached, I was shocked to see him lying on the road. His wrist was broken. Had it been a head injury, he wouldn\'t have survived," said Chaturvedi. His father is admitted to a government hospital.While Gwalior SP Ashish did not respond to calls, range IG Anil Kumar refused to comment on the case. "My father was on the road for 37 minutes without help. These cops could have admitted him in any hospital," Chaturvedi said.The incident took place under Jhansi Road police station against which Chaturvedi had filed a case, accusing cops of harassing him by keeping him under 24x7 surveillance.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

"Ok, I agree that the country has been shit forever. But what's different is the attitude of people. If under other party ruling or during different time 50 people died because of a single scam, there would be outrage.\n\nHere, you can see any effect on government? At all?\n\nI completely disagree with your point. People like to shit on congress saying that they were too corrupt. But what was good, you know? Not a single person - even who voted congress regularly- defended congress. I've never seen a person who did not criticize congress for a single scam occurred under them. \n\n50 people died - And, you're saying it's a regular occurrence in Indian politics? Death of a one or two person is what I've heard of but systemically removing 50 witnesses / whistle-blowers from the face of the earth with common perception of it being a regular / normal occurrence can only happen in India or Hollywood movie"

"Humans as a species are horrible. We are seriously meant to die a tragic death. We don't care for our people nor for the environment."

'Not at all. He is at fault. I am just trying to rationalize. :)'
'It\'s a silly and sad one. \n\nEither you just got to the point where you literally don\'t give a shit about others as you\'re in your luxury home, or you don\'t care about the society you live in and raise kids in, or you naively think crime/corruption can never affect you just because it hasn\'t happened yet so therefore it never will. Likewise, people talk about how cities aren\'t liveable if you\'re handicapped in India - it\'s silly to think "well no one in my family is handicapped now so this will never ever matter or affect me."'

"Killing for Food is natural. That is how our species has survived and thrived. Killing/torturing for sport or other reasons is unnatural and immoral.

It's not a binary issue of killing vs not killing. It's a bit more nuanced than that."

'Well atleast "Poachers are just poor people" card will be useless.'
'Go ahead and read the whole article along with the BBC documents. I know the OP is sounding a bit misleading but if you real all the materials you will know that the rangers asks the poachers of their identity first and without replying with words, they answer in gun fire. So, as a reciprocation the rangers return fires. Most of these poachers are uneducated so these type of behavior is common and expected from them.'

'>The park justifies the number of deaths, saying the figures are so high because the heavily armed poaching gangs engage guards in deadly shoot-outs. However, the statistics indicate that these "encounters" are more one-sided than the park suggests. Once again, firm figures are hard to come by, but according to the reports we can find just one park guard has been killed by poachers in the past 20 years, compared with 106 people shot dead by guards over the same period.\n\nHow is this any different from the british labeling pardhi and other tribes "criminal tribes" and going around killing them? '
"Don't share BBC articles on this sub"
'Fuck BBC, its suffering from separation anxiety with regards to India.'
"A lot of times, the boundaries are never clearly defined. The rangers have been accused of torturing and killing innocent people including kids. The park has also been accused of uprooting local tribes who've lived there for ages. \n\nDo listen to the original BBC podcast on this issue - http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04rlrvt. \n\nI'm not defending one side or the other but I don't think the issue is as black and white as you think it might be. It's much more nuanced and having rangers shoot at sight without oversight is a dangerous precedent to set. "

'Morality and "naturalness" is subjective. In the same way you might opine that hunting for sport is wrong, someone else is going to feel that killing for food when vegetarian options exist is equally wrong.\n\n> It\'s a bit more nuanced than that.\n\nI agree, but it\'s even more nuanced than you\'re willing to admit.'
"This is Assam. With the right people you can buy freshly made assault rifles made in South China under 2 lakhs, handgrenades for under 1 lakh and pistols for similar prices. There are so many surplus weapons from ex-militants that new militants don't bother even leaving the country to get them. Its going to escalate if the rangers insist on this shoot to kill policy.\n\n\nBut you are right, the tribal hunters use muzzle loaders, though, many have shotguns nowdays. Those ganja gangs have stepped up to opium in recent times, in upper Assam. I have friends and family who are in law enforcement tell me that they are buying more sophisticated weaponry now days."
"303 is considered a meh weapon but it's made by Lee enfield of UK and in many wars, it had been used as a sniper rifle. Even used now in Afghanistan in long range role. Very lethal in right hands"
'> The BBC feature shows park rangers who have been given the license to **“shoot-on-sight”**, a power they have used with deadly effect. In 2015 more than 20 poachers were killed – more than the numbers of rhino poached that year.\n\n> The programme accuses the rangers of **extra-judicial killings** of suspected rhino poachers. '
'People can move from ages old places. Ask all the people who lost land for projects.'
'Yes, it does.  Killing is a part of living.  Killing people, killing animals, killing plants, fungi, killing bacteria and other microbes with antibiotics.  It\'s unavoidable.  The only creatures that don\'t kill are the ones at the very bottom of the food chain: plants, fungi, bacteria, and you can even find examples of each of those that kill.\n\nOnly two major cultures in all of history (that I\'m aware of, anyway) have ever decided that killing animals is undesirable, Hindustan and Japan.  I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence that both of those societies also had a class of untouchables (in Japan, they were and are called "Burakumin," or more unkindly, "Eta.") who would perform the work of killing and processing animals that everyone else considered socially undesirable.'

'Plastic roads are to be used to have an alternate use for the waste plastic however it is not viable and it is harmful too.\n\nIt releses harmful gases due to burning of these plastics while laying roads making it unsafe for workers laying the roads and it release harmful Hcl gas at the first instant of rain after laying it.\n\nSince plastics use various elements in it like softeners, phthalates, anti oxidants, flame retardants, fillers etc which emit toxic gases on heating which cause birth defects to cancer!\n\nSo instead of using it with bitumen we can look at plastic roads like [this](https://thinkprogress.org/netherlands-company-introduces-plastic-roads-that-are-more-durable-climate-friendly-than-asphalt-ecb7c2a11a50) though its still in idea phase.'

"Correct me if I am wrong, but this is a disaster. I read about plastic being used to lay roads long ago and couldn't help think how is that good for environment. The plastic on road is still non-biodegradable. The heat and daily wear and tear will release a lot of plastic into soil, air and with rains, into the water. Who came up with this idea?"
"I think it's common sense that plastics are a bad idea. They'll melt easily and not much different from burning them. Road temperatures go very high."
"Genuinely curious, is that better or worse than dumping the plastic in landfills and burning them? Is it worse because it's now a microplastics issue?"
'The **only** alternative is to go green and reduce plastic use as much as possible because plastics are virtually indestructible, and **any** attempts to destroy them give rise to new problems and new pollutants.'
'Friction to begin with. Collisions. Dropped secondary particles (such as nails, stone chips) rubbing between road and tyre. Many other similar factors.\n\nPlastic roads are a disaster for local ecology.'
'yeah.. i agree with you....its far better than dumping here and there on the roads. most of the animals die by eating this plastic.\n'
"Burning or burying them doesn't turn them into [microplastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics), which is potentially a bigger problem than having large pieces around. Not completely sure though"
"There's something called [TDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization) to convert plastics to fuel which could be adopted however, it has its limitations and the companies using this technology ran into problems. \n\nA Japanese company sells [a machine that converts plastic into oil at your own home!](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/blest-machine) but it costs £6,000 and above! ;)\n\nSo reducing plastic usage is the only way go - as alternatives are not that convenient but neither is living in a dead planet convenient!"

'In reference to the references to Hindu culture in this whole argument, I read a bit and it\'s interesting..\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\nThe Manusmriti, which lists the oldest codes of conduct that were proposed to be followed by a Hindu, admonishes homosexual behavior only mildly. \r\n\r\nHomosexual behavior among ordinary males of the priestly class is classified only as a minor offense for which a ritual bathing is prescribed. In regard to female homosexuality, it is only deemed punishable if young, unmarried girls are involved. For instance, the verse referring to sexual relations between an older woman and a young virgin girl reads"...a woman who pollutes a damsel (unmarried girl) shall instantly have (her head) shaved or two fingers cut off, and be made to ride (through the town) on a donkey", suggesting a severe punishment. \r\n\r\nHowever, the verse referring to sexual relations between two virgin girls suggests a relatively milder punishment – "...a damsel who pollutes (another) damsel must be fined two hundred (panas), pay the double of her (nuptial) fee, and receive ten (lashes with a) rod". These provisions, quoted out of context, seem homophobic, but in fact they are concerned not with the gender of the partners but with the loss of virginity that rendered a young girl unworthy of marriage. For instance, the punishment for a forced sex act between a man and a woman states "...if any man through insolence forcibly contaminates a maiden, two of his fingers shall be instantly cut off, and he shall pay a fine of six hundred (panas)", which seems more severe in comparison to the punishment prescribed for the same act between two virgins. \r\n\r\nHomosexual intercourse between men was sought to be censured by a prescription of a bath with one\'s clothes on, and a penance of "eating the five products of the cow and keeping a one-night fast" – the penance being a replacement of the traditional concept of homosexual intercourse resulting in a loss of caste.\r\n\r\nThe discrepancy in treatment may have been due to the text\'s non-equal views on males and females, considering that the Manusmriti is the same scripture that has stated that the status of woman in the society is the same as (or even lower than) that of a man’s land, his cattle and other possessions.\r\n\r\nTL,DR;\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Homosexuality in ancient India, like now existed and was acknowledged (if not liberally accepted).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In terms of law, things were much more contentious on the gender front than on alternate sexualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Priests (read Brahmans) could fuck men at will, but needed to bathe later.'
"Why bother about 'gay lives matter' when you have 'gau lives matter'"
"Actually british brought it with them. British in the 1800s-1900s were conservative as fuck, they introduced a lot of conservative shit in India. This was one of them. I think the actual law was made in 1860 and we are still following it, so it was definitely the british.\n\nIt's just that they've gotten more liberal now and have been removing these laws one by one, but we haven't gotten much better and are still stuck with the conservatism that they left us with."

"Wow, this comment is so wrong! \n\nSC had overturned the HC order because SC felt that the previous order was judicial overreach on part of the HC. It wanted the legislature to decide on this matter. \n\nI totally disagree with SC thinking (the reason it cited), because I like many others, think disallowing homosexuality is in violation of the freedom our constitution guarantees us, and it *is* a matter that the court can decide, not just the politicians. \n\nBut if we must blame SC, we need to blame how they interpreted the constitution, NOT because they said, 'homosexuality bad, because *kulcha*'; the latter is totally false!"

The ancient literature we have now, is of the likes of Harry Potter, Two States, etc. Stuff which was copied at every book vendor kinda literature.\n\nOh and of course the British forced science. Very few people know what the Vedas have to say. Amazingly, the Vedas are still relevant in these times.\n\nGo 50 or maybe 100 years in the future. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that India has all the literature written about every scientific discovery man made and still to make.

"I was one of the people who signed the online petition. I don't think Mr.Tharoor stands against Modi. I just did it as a fuck you to Rahul Gandhi. "
"I used to have a huge crush on Tharoor as a teen. But he's everything that's wrong with the middle class perception of who can lead India.  \n\nYeah he writes books and speaks with a British accent. But look at what he's done. He ran for UN gen sec post when it was made abundantly clear to India that ban ki moon was supposed to be the candidate they were to support, and in exchange, India was to get other important perks (I don't remember what exactly). He ran anyway and lost. And India lost what they were supposed to get in exchange. I think it was veto power in general assembly but I may be wrong.\n\nThen he comes back to India, becomes an MP, then runs his mouth and gets kicked out. Within a couple of years itself he is embroiled in a corruption scandal. Most people in power take way longer to get into a multi crore scam. And his wife took all the blame for his corruption. \n\nThen his wife, a kashmiri pandit tweeted about the plight of  her community, and he gets a 'handle your wife' order and makes her rescind her statements.\n\nThen he is an Indian MP sexting a Pakistani journalist, when he is married. That is a huge huge security issue. It opens him up to blackmail by the ISI. And still no action is taken.\n\nFinally his wife dies in very very suspicious circumstances and he isn't questioned or anything, says some lupus something (it's never lupus), and the whole media establishment takes his word for it. \n\nI've also heard from friends in the UN that he was a shady fuck who pulled all kinds of strings to get his second wife's office located next to his so that he could patao her. While still married to the first wife. \n\nSo much shadiness shouldn't be excused just because he sounds articulate. \n\nThe upper middle class accuses the lower class of falling for shitty promises, but we aren't any better because if someone speaks good English we think they are great and everything they say is right. \n\nAFAIK he hasn't accomplished anything significant in development or politics. He isn't qualified to be the PM. He hasn't come up from the grassroots, and I doubt he can hold his own against mass politicians. He will be very amenable to all kinds of pressure and won't be a strong leader. I doubt he can keep his party in line or if they even respect him. My understanding is that he is the pretty boy they tout out to make them look good and then he goes back into the box he came from."

Now when i try whatever username to register it fails by saying that username already exists. I did shoot out an email to axisbank to clarify and to see if anyone has bothered to use it.\n\nThey have also mentioned an SMS based balance / transaction inquiry system. Which also seems to be not working other than taking 3rs per message, it doesnt deliver what it promises.\n\nIt seems its a very shoddy effort put together by axis bank to support KMRL. The card itself is not the best construction as well, plastic sheets seems to be coming off it quite easily ! and its clearly evident that its not going to last the 3 years they promise its going to last.\n\nEDIT: Its a stored value, EMV Rupay card'

"Corruption isn't something that has just disappeared from India and it's an endemic problem.

'No you know nothing about his past.You only came to know him since 2014 when he was planted in UP to polarize Hindus from Muslims.His first line when he landed there was "Ram Mandir yehi banega.Hume jeetaiyen,Hum jaldi bana denge." Then Muzaffarnagar Riots happened with his blessings.That\'s what he is good at.He had no formal education in the first place.He was a wall painter, Modi was a Chai wala.

'I know right.I am not saying he is the only special case in India.Unfortunately, I mean really really unfortunate for our country is that 90% of our politicians belonging to 100s of parties are like that.Rest all others are Criminal Lawyers and Businessmen and former Cops etc. They very well know how to beat the system, because our Indian Law allows it. We allow it too mostly.We get bullied by them, their muscle power makes them popular in the area.Similar to "Bhai" or "Dada" who later becomes well known Gangsters.Like Dawood and Chotta Rajan, only legal when they associate themselves with constitutionally accepted group with symbol. We haven\'t set the bars for them.\n\nI blame Mahatma Gandhi (in some way) for this very reason. He started a group of Satyagrahis to tackle the Britishers because he had no choice, as he was quite alone in this.He needed a mass support for it. Didn\'t matter to him who was what.As long as he could gather crowd.So in todays world, Indian Gov\'t and Law is wearing that same Britishers shoes now, who cannot control the system. Simply doing what they could with their minimum powers because we manipulate constitution as per our liking.No strictness in that.Human rights comes before everything.Which means, no matter how much heinous crimes we could commit, we will be living more longer and prosper.\n\nBecause Human right violations comes first. We can kill a Snake if it bites us, we can stone a Dog to death if he bites us too.But we cannot punish other human even under the law because we Indians are hypocrite that mass murderers are Humans too, with heart and brain.They have a family who will appeal emotionally. And we have lawyers who defend them to tell that to court that he is not guilty.\n\nWe are the reason for our doom.People say Terrorists are worst human beings,but we have fucked it up by defining terrorism with cross border tensions only.What we want to do with our enemy nation is termed as Patriotism.And what happens to us day in and day out are just mere crimes under the law.Even murders and road accidents.\n\nWe grew up this way.It\'s ok and normal if one of our kids broke the window pane of our own house...but if our neighbours kids do the same, they are bad kids and we blame their family for not teaching them manners.It starts with this thought.Our own home law doesn\'t teach us to follow equal treatment and punishment for the same crime.\n'

Women in Walled City say they will continue to follow practice; activists say there’s lack of awareness ](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/courts-verdict-on-triple-talaq-cant-override-faith/article19542345.ece) \n\n> A sultry Tuesday afternoon saw the area around Jama Masjid in the Walled City buzzing with activity and large families busy shopping — a day like any other.\n\n> No one seemed to be aware that the Supreme Court had just hours earlier announced its judgment declaring triple talaq, or instant divorce, unconstitutional.\n\n> Asked about the apex court judgment, most looked perplexed and immediately dismissed it.\n\n> “The Supreme Court is wrong. For us, triple talaq is everything. Nothing can override what our religion tells us to do. We will continue to practice what has been prevalent throughout these years. It is ultimately a matter of our faith and we are the ones who have the right to take a decision about it” said Mehvish, a 56-year-old homemaker.\n\n> Stressing the relevance of the age-old practice, 35-year-old homemaker and mother of two Parveena said: “My family is of utmost importance to me. If my husband utters the word thrice, then I am bound to leave that very instant. No one can question that as this is what our religion tells us. No judgment or court can change this fact. We will continue to follow this.”\n\n> Raising questions over the Supreme Court judgment, 36-year-old Masood Ahmad, who was out shopping with his family, said: “This is nothing but interference from the Supreme Court. We will follow what our religious laws say, and that is all that we are concerned with”.\n\n> ‘Lack of awareness’\n\n> Citing a lack of awareness at the ground level, Mariya Salim of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said: “The Muslim Personal Law Boards have created terror among Muslim women by bringing other issues like the Uniform Civil Code to the front. These women are misinformed to a great extent. It is this ignorance which leads them to believe that instant talaq is Islamic, even when it is not.”\n\n> Stressing the need to increase awareness, Naqueed Alam (62), a retired professional, said: “The leaders of our clergy have not done enough to educate the masses on matters that plague society, such as triple talaq and halala. Organisations such as the MPLBs should now proactively work towards educating society so that the Muslim society accepts the change in the law.”\n\n> “It is just the first step. Only calling it unlawful will not eradicate it from the society. There are millions who need to be made aware of the unjust and exploitative use of triple talaq,” said Haseeb Alam, a homemaker.'

It also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured.\n\nOn the night of September 11, 2008, Bhasin – then a BBA student – had crushed Anuj Chauhan and his friend, Mrigank Srivastava, under his BMW car at Moolchand in South Delhi. While Chauhan died in a city hospital, Srivastava survived the accident. Bhasin was arrested from ISBT Kashmere Gate while he was fleeing to Chandigarh.\n\nThough the court had passed the verdict in May, the quantum of punishment was pronounced only on Saturday. It also granted statutory bail to Bhasin, enabling him to file an appeal in the high court. The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.\n\nBhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.\n\nThe court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judge also quoted a song from the movie Jindagi aur Toofan – which goes ‘Aadmi chahe toh taqdeer badal sakte hai, poori duniya ki woh tasveer badal sakte hai, aadmi soch toh le uska irada kya hai (Humankind can change its fate if it wants to, can change the entire picture of the world if it wants to, as long as there is a strong resolve to do so)’ – to buttress his point.\n\nThe court noted that India has a “disreputable record of road accidents”, with a total of 4.64 lakh road accidents being reported in 2015 alone.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

'>“The sentence for killing cow is five, seven or 14 years in different states, but the sentence for causing the death of a human being through rash or negligent driving is only two years,” additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar said.\n\nWow! What country do we live in?'
'What if you kill a cow with a BMW. Tell me that.'
'It shows the priority of people. RSS gets annoyed when a cow gets killed, but humans just ignore when someone gets killed.\n\n'
"He's comparing apples to oranges, rash and negligent driving isn't the same as homicide or even murder, that would have been a better comparison. The minimum punishment for homicide is 10 years."
'In America they gave 16 years to a man for killing cats. India is just copying the west like always. \n\nlol'
'Unfortunately, judges are losing discretionary powers in our criminal justice system. '
"While I completely despise Gau Rakshaks and the ideology that props them up along with their sympathizers, manslaughter anywhere in the world is always given a relatively light sentence. People really don't understand the law involving drunk driving or reckless driving.\n\nUnless you can prove 1st degree murder, you will never get a huge sentence under DUI deaths."
"Doesn't look like someone who sucks dicks of the ruling party. So, no..."
'Killing cows: 14 years in jail\n\n... BMW: 100 Cr movie contact'
'so the punishment for homicide is 10 yrs, and for moo-micide is 14 yrs. so his point still stands.'
">homicide or even murder\n\nWe're talking about a fucking cow here. Open a dictionary sometime to understand the meaning of homicide. Should all non-vegetarians be convicted of murder of chickens, fish, goats etc.?"
'The charge of Culpable homicide (not amounting to murder) was dropped & hence sections only under MV act remained..\n\nAnyways- The traffic laws in India are non existent for general public. No enforcement, civic sense abt following them is also below zero.\n\nDriving License- Bikte hai, Mithai ki tarah.'
'Someone who tortures and sexually abuses dead cats deserves to be locked away forever.\n\nhttp://time.com/4859767/judge-sentences-man-who-lured-and-killed-21-cats/\n\nNice that you tried to dig up an obscure case to defend India somehow and at the same time pin it on "people copying the West". Also some bonus cow-pet-cat faux-outrage and shitlogic too.\n\nOr maybe this is satire? I can often not tell these days.\n\n'
'Sure. But how do you feel about the punishment when compared to killing a cow vs a human being?'
'14^2 =196 blows by roadside lynch mob and get certified dead on arrival at the hospital.'
"But it was still an accident. The perpetrator didn't intend for the victim to die. It bad but not as bad as killing someone on purpose. Even in first degree murder the law differentiates between crimes of passion and planned cold blooded murder."
'It can and should, but is it in any country?\n\nI completely disagree with the bizarre sentencing Indian states have for killing cows by the way. But the manslaughter issue seems to be fairly consistent all over the world and the punishment is rarely the same as for homicide.'
'It can be, I guess the legislative wanted it to be a distinct, special crime because of its high incidence. '
"I agree, it's still a bad analogy, which is why you cannot compare crimes upon humans and crimes upon anilmals. That is the point."
"It's ridiculous - the punishments we have for killing cows in some states is mainly a way to persecute anybody who doesn't worship cows. This would include not only muslims and christians but many other religions too, including hindus. In fact people who own cows are harassed by this - and they are often hindus.\n\nBasically it's a way to impose a very specific and narrow form of Hinduism on the entire country. It's disgusting but I think bringing up manslaughter is not a good argument."
'Chi chi, censor board ko bulao kya?'
"Please tell me you're being sarcastic here and you don't believe in this nonsense.\n\nIf I hear the pet/cow argument used to defend gau rakshaks one more time I swear..."
'He is scared. He is crying alone. Will that count as masturbation ?'
"It was a poor attempt at satire but I really think that 16 years was an overkill. That man belongs to a mental hospital rather than come out 16 years later and attempt the same shit again. Oh wait, they can't really treat psycho, can they? "
'I agree, Homicide is completely different from Murder, because of the specific intention. Which is why murder is worse. '
'Rehabilitation in prison is a lie. Most people who get out of prison return to a life of crime. If India had similar laws like the US that locked aways three strikes offenders for life, crime in India would drastically reduce and if we followed a private prison system, revenue would increase. A lot of people shit on America as having terrible laws, but in reality the failure of their education and wealth distribution policies necessitated such barbaric treatment'
'You cry in that position?'
'I really thought I was going to see a /s at the end but no, you actually believe this bullshit. And surely you have a reputable psychological study which proves your totally reasonable claim that prison rehabilitation is a lie. Right?\n'
"Well they have to do that or else people will change channel to Republic tv shouting shows or some equally loud and obnoxious show. After 17 years of Ekta's 'Dhun dun dun', shows now aren't peaceful anymore. Every show has to be loud for it to survive.          "

'Well, I am not the only one who feels so. Couple of years back a regional version of this hosted by Nagarjuna and then Chiranjeevi offered the same shit.

Then the H1N1 question made me think that either KBC is doing some fake shit here or the doctor is very subpar. And the latter isn\'t good at all...\n\nEven Amitabh Bachchan didn\'t cut her slack.

'There are two sides to this. Ancient religious rituals cannot be justified by 21st century morals. But are we accepting Abrahamic values of **modesty** for the roles of women? \n\nAt times, we have a healthier relationship with the ideas of women\'s bodies and nudity. Of course not always, but we don\'t suffer from [women being shamed for breastfeeding in public](https://qz.com/756499/americas-sexualization-of-breasts-is-so-pervasive-even-other-women-think-public-breastfeeding-is-gross/).\n\nAll this to say there is nothing inherently wrong with boys or girls being half-naked anywhere. **What is wrong** is that these rituals are linked [to exploitation:](https://everylifecounts.ndtv.com/200-year-old-traditions-says-tamil-nadu-bare-chested-girls-temples-16849?pfrom=home-lateststories)\n\n> ... the girls are "are then forbidden to marry and must earn their living by dancing at the temples \n\n> ...\n\n> These girls, or Mathammas as they are referred to in parts of Tamil Nadu, are then forbidden to marry and must earn their living by dancing at the temples.\n> '

"The problem with ritual is that it's simply a set of chores for the sheep to do, so they can occupy third mind and not lead revolts against the ruling and privileged classes. And that's always going to be appealing. So even if you move forward something else will replace that... \n\nAs far as these things are going, no one can contest the fact that despite it's shortfalls, a lot less people have to suffer, work in dearth, and exploited in the name of trade, as a percentage ( because obviously 0.01% of 8 billion is still a lot more than 50% of a few million people).\n\nNever in the history of mankind has there been such a resource rich access for such a big fraction of society.

"LMAO, asking pre-pubescent girls to be naked in public is by definition abuse. Officials should not let their religion cloud their judgment, but that's too much to ask in a country like India.\n\nBesides, if they are being sexually abused by the priests, you will never find out until one of the girls comes out with it, because it's not something that happens in public."

"This may or may not be of interest to a layman but it is extremely relevant to historians. This is not an affair between two random people or even between two celebrities. This is about an affair between between two extremely powerful people. \n\nAffairs, especially the illegitimate types, are big points of leverage. If you have been following r/politics, you would know that security clearance at very high levels are extremely intrusive about the private life of individual and for good reason. Did Mountbatten extract compromises out of Nehru using his wife? Did Nehru respond to Lady Mountbatten's persuasion which he would otherwise not have acceded to? Did Lord Mountbatten take decision only to spite Nehru because of his affair with his wife? How did the British look at this affairs between the royalty of Britain and a low life Indians? Did they take offence and respond likewise? Did Nehru's political rivals use the affair to blackmail him? And how did this event affect the course of India's history. Would you not be interested to know how one person's misdemeanor cost you and your country? \n\nAffairs are deadly things especially in corridors of power and it is rightful that historians investigate this and understand the full scope and the fall out if any. History is not only about the events but also about the people involved. \n\nAs far as the young lady is concerned, unfortunately being born in royal society means one has to bear both the privileges and the embarrassment that may come with it. She is not the scope of the discussion. She is an unfortunate witness to the event."

"No, the reason that people are talking about this is that this kind of affair is a hard blow to Nehru's image, that of a principled, kid-loving man. And I am damn fucking sure that if this was about a right wing guy, people would have shamed the descendants to death even if the allegations were not confirmed.\n\nI am referring to the alleged homosexual relationship between Savarkar and Godse. I mean, what the fucking hell! That man was separated from his family and his son died! He spent 50 or so years in jail!

"Why annex Tibet? Why attempt to cut off India from its Eastern territories by building bases near the Chicken Neck? Why take over the South Chinese sea?\n\nWhy take over the Sudetenland? Or the Danzig corridor? Some nations do irrational things. Pakistan somehow thinks its a good idea to send militants into Kashmir to slaughter soldiers, even though India has an unquestionably larger, more modern military, but they do. \n\n/u/namesnotrequired I think has a good idea on the situation, but I will provide my take:\n\nChina does not have a lot of allies in the region. Arguably, they have Pakistan, Cambodia, and Burma. The rest are seemingly aligned with other powers in some form or fashion - either to the US (Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Phillippines) or India (Bangladesh, Vietnam, Bhutan).\n\nIn order to maintain relationships with their allies, they must show them that they are in a position to make good on their commitments. To Pakistan, this means force projection against India if it was ever needed... The same for Burma. If any conflict ever arises in that portion of the region, China will face far larger logistical problems than India, so they must look for advantages wherever they could come from.. And that means being able to stop or greatly hinder the possibility of forces in Sikkim and anything east of that.\n\nAt least that's IMO. I'm American, so I can't fully grasp all geopolitics of the region, but I would imagine its not much different than what the US does with its bases in its allied countries. The only difference is that China is willing to (seemingly) risk more agitation of neighboring nations than, say, the US is. "
"> Yes, and that hasn't gained them much.\n\nU r wrong. China has continued with occupying new islands in South China sea. Though it wont be that easy India.

So China's stubbornness made them less likable than they were.\n\n> Many countries like Vietnam, Mongolia, Japan, Philippines are looking at us.\n\nIndia has an unofficial alliance with Japan. America, UK would support India in case of a war. It's not worth it for China, but they may be too stubborn to avoid it.\n\nVietnam had invasions from China several times in history, but they could push them back with guerrilla tactics."

They said the film-goers, who have not been identified, had refused to stand after being asked to do so by organisers and police. "They were formally arrested and later released on bail," said Sparjan Kumar, police chief of the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\n\nMr Kumar said six of the 12 had been assaulted after refusing to stand, but that no charges would be brought against the attackers. "We are yet to receive a complaint over the assault. There is no investigation in (that) incident," he told news agency AFP.  Mr Kumar said the 12 cinema-goers arrested in his state had been charged with various related offences, including contempt of court.\n\n\n\nBefore that, on Sunday, eight people were arrested at a cinema in Chennai after being assaulted by a group of 20 men during the interval for allegedly refusing to stand. They were reportedly charged under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act and face up to three years in jail if found guilty.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court did not specify a penalty for failure to stand, or indicate who was to take charge of monitoring rule-breaking and assigning punishment.\n\n\n\nBefore the latest order, the playing of the national anthem was only compulsory in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\nWith inputs from AFP\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.6a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article\'s ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Rendered ^by ^PROMETHEUS'

'20 Arrested In 48 Hours For Failing To Stand For Anthem In Cinemas\n\n---\n\n>* Around 20 people have been arrested after being accused of failing to stand for the national anthem in cinemas, two weeks after the Supreme Court made it compulsory.The Supreme Court ruled on November 30 that cinemas should play the national anthem before every screening , and that the audience should stand, drawing angry accusations of an assault on civil liberties.12 people were arrested on Monday at an international film festival in Kerala for failing to observe the order, the police said.\n\n>* They said the film-goers, who have not been identified, had refused to stand after being asked to do so by organisers and police.\n\n>* "They were formally arrested and later released on bail," said Sparjan Kumar, police chief of the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram.Mr Kumar said six of the 12 had been assaulted after refusing to stand, but that no charges would be brought against the attackers.\n\n>* Mr Kumar said the 12 cinema-goers arrested in his state had been charged with various related offences, including contempt of court.Before that, on Sunday, eight people were arrested at a cinema in Chennai after being assaulted by a group of 20 men during the interval for allegedly refusing to stand.\n\n>* They were reportedly charged under the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act and face up to three years in jail if found guilty.The Supreme Court did not specify a penalty for failure to stand, or indicate who was to take charge of monitoring rule-breaking and assigning punishment.Before the latest order, the playing of the national anthem was only compulsory in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\n---\n\n^I\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^"delete" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme'

'#Mumbai Girl Saves Uber Driver\'s Career With Her Statement\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2016/Nov/uber_1480242710_1480242714_800x420.jpg)\n\n___\n\nMisandry has become the latest fad these days. People do not need a reason to hate men - if anything goes wrong, it\'s the man\'s fault. But tell you what, it isn\'t always. In a world where evil is thriving at the speed of light, it is extremely difficult to take a side.\n\n\n\nAs quoted by Elie Wiesel "We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere."\n\nWhich is exactly what this girl did. Recently, Himani Jain, a resident of Mumbai took a cab home after office.\n\nlmt\n\nDuring her journey, she experienced the ill-behaviour of her Uber-pool co-passenger against her innocent driver, and she decided to speak up. She happened to share her ride with a woman, who started abusing the driver for no good reason. According to Himani, there was some miscommunication between the two, but the woman\'s reaction was absolutely unacceptable. The driver sat mum, without any signs of disrespect, but the woman kept on abusing him.\n\nHad it not been for her, the driver\'s career would have gone for a toss!\n\nofficechai\n\nRead her story here:\n\nHappened with me yesterday\n\nI took Uber Pool to home from office yesterday. The driver, Shahid (Name changed), was very polite and well behaved. I was sharing cab with a lady, Gayatri (Name changed), who was probably in her late thirties. She got into the cab and within a minute she started arguing with Shahid about the drop. He explained her politely that it doesn\'t matter, he will drop according to the App to the provided address and she can\'t choose the route.\n\nGayatri started speaking to Shahid in extremely derogatory tone. She said (shouted) that she is not new to Uber and he is too stupid understand her question. Gayatri used words like dumb, Ch***ya, MC, BC, "I will slap you"etc. Shahid kept calm and asked her if he should start the trip. I asked Gayatri to stay calm and explained that there is a miscommunication between you and Shahid, and I will explain him. By this time she lost her cool completely and asked Shahid to come to police station and asked me to join her in her complaint. When I disagreed she started verbally abusing me as well. Shahid ended my trip, apologized for the inconvenience and asked me to take another ride home. While all this drama was happening 20 odd people and two security ladies gathered around our cab. I gave my number to security lady so that they can contact me in case police trouble Shahid. Meanwhile, both Gayatri and Shahid had already dialed 100 and cops came in no time. I explained them the situation, gave my number to the police as well in case they want my statement in favour of Shahid. When I was about to leave, the security Lady came to me and said "Madam, please jao na police station, wo maar daalenge isko. Ladies ka case hai toh iska koi nahi sunega". Though it was already 9pm and I was scared to go to police station(first experience), I didn\'t feel like leaving him in that situation so I decided to go police station along with them. And the funny part is that when Gayatri was explaining all this ruckus to the Constable, he asked "madam where is the problem". When she saw nothing happening her way, she made false accusations against Shahid of verbally abusing her and asking her to get out of the car and asked them to lodge an FIR against him.\n\nI gave my statement to the police and told them that neither I am related to Shahid nor Gayatri and I had no reason to come here. I came here to support Shahid who is completely innocent in this case. She did not leave police station till 11pm. Gayatri demanded that the driver should apologize her and touch her feet as a part of apology. Apparently she wanted to teach him a lesson. I stayed there till she left the police station. I spoke to the police and fortunately, they understood the situation. They placated her that they will take action against him and asked her to leave. Meanwhile they took Shahid to a room and I could hear sounds of someone getting beaten up. I ran to the Constable and I said there is no mistake of him. To my surprise, they were beating the floor with the belt and Shahid was just making noises with a smile. I don\'t know if it was right or wrong but I felt happy. Cop came and thanked me for standing up for Shahid otherwise it would have been a disaster for the driver. I felt contended. I called Shahid after an hour of reaching home. He is sound and safe. :)\n\nThanks to Mumbai police for understanding.\n\nHere\'s the original post\n\nMore power to you, girl!\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.5b ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article\'s ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)'

To my surprise, they were beating the floor with the belt and Shahid was just making noises with a smile. I don't know if it was right or wrong but I felt happy.\n\nSo, pussy happily got a pass.\n\nThese kind of false accusers trivialize and mis-advertise sufferings of actual victims.  They should be punished severely.\n\nEdit: Just to add that as title suggest, this girl not only saved Uber driver's career, but saved his life from Jail and there by his family.  As inadvertent police could've put that men behind bars.  Another point to be noted, it is just a woman's word against a man's, proofs and facts notwithstanding.  Just he said she said scenario, not good."
'The bitch needs to be shamed publicly.  Why did the cops let her go free? '
"I was talking to the Uber team a few days ago where we were discussing the problems Uber pool passengers face. Most of the drivers I have taken a ride with are polite and understanding. While a lot of co-passengers I have encountered are downright snobs and talk to the drivers like they are slaves. \n\nOne of the points which came out in the discussion was that there can be a rating for the co-passengers. While, it is a good way to keep a track of people, rating other people is never a very bright idea. Because if someone doesn't like the other one generally they can still rate them bad (Black Mirror S03E01 anyone?). So a good feature would be to have comment box if you have any complaints generally for the co-rider specifically."

">taken [her] to task for allowing this to happen at all, if the testimony given is true.\n\n\nAgreed. But what is the legal procedure to do what you propose? There could be a lack of substantial proof.\n\n\nBecause there's no clear legality there (Randian lawyers please do chime in) and the police personnel had to placate her somehow. Its a middle ground they found, lest the lady turns out to be 'tu janta nahi main kaun hoon' junta. That needs to be stood up to, but there's no way to as of now when that culture is as widespread as it is.\n"

"Very good idea but 2 problems that I can think of with comment is that\n\n1). People are much more likely to just press a button and give rating instead of making and effort and narrating a story(less data).\n2). You will need some human to read and understand and finally rate(assign a score) of each passenger. Uber/ola won't employ people to just do that, in case of rating it's all can be automated.\n\nBefore you say that parsing and data mining can automate reading comment, understanding sentiment and assigning score let me tell you that technology is not there yet. Accuracy of any such approaches will not be feasible."
'DEAD MEME.'
'> These are the most with-it and savvy police department in the country. See how they handled the situation. By keeping the illusion up for the complainant\'s sake that they are just her private army who will beat up anyone she complains about while realising the true nature of the incident and doing right by the accused.\n\nI respectfully disagree - what they did was extremely dangerous and sets a very bad precedent. It\'s definitely an entirely different set of circumstances if they did this with someone who has schizophrenia or dementia to diffuse the situation. They should\'ve pointed out that she was full of shit and shown her the consequences of trying to raise false charges and deliberately lying to law enforcement, but they didn\'t. \n\nThis is a perfectly normal person we\'re talking about here, not someone who cannot comprehend that they\'re wrong and could get violent. They should\'ve shut her down immediately and shown her the consequences of trying to raise false charges considering there was another party witness to the exchange. ***That*** is justice for the accused. Not placating the woman with the equivalent "Don\'t you worry dear, we\'ll take care of the meanie ol\' Uber driver for you!". That rewards her shitty behaviour by complicity from the police and that\'s straight up *wrong*. They\'re not there to stop drama, they\'re there to enforce the law *and* protect the citizenry. \n\nAlso, who\'s to say that the next cop that tries the approach actually believes the woman over the guy if there was no witness involved? Considering that *that* is the default, you should be very, *very* worried to be a man in this country. What this woman did was commendable, but the cops handled this badly if her testimony of the event is accurate. '

I mean, what if this shit shows up on Facebook-wacebook? Naah,*isko bhaga dete hain yahaan se*." move. The "Tu janta nahi main kaun hoon" thing is a double edged sword and it wouldn\'t have worked in her favour in this case, considering a co-operative witness. '

'US Medical system is unduly expensive which is true. In pure dollar terms, India\'s medical system is cheap which is also true. What is bad is the accessibility and quality of medical treatment in India where corruption and medical malpractices are rampant. Public hospitals are the life savers for poor people but all of them are swamped with patients, just have a cursory visit to any public wards in AIIMS and you will see how terrible the conditions are and how long waits are there for basic operations. For richer folks, insurances cover too little and the premiums are very high compared to the amount of coverage (e.g. 40k premium on a 5 lakh insurance.) plus 4 year wait for preexisting conditions. Moreover where do you get treated where they won\'t "cheat" you with useless bills and tests and surgery options? Max for example overcharges are lot and is staffed with incompetent, same goes with a lot of other name brand hospitals.

"Cancer drugs aren't your otc pills that companies are making them in generic quantities."
'Here\'s the reality of Indian healthcare - something like 95% of the population (possibly much more) is uninsured. They have to go to public hospitals which are overburdened, understaffed, filthy, under-equipped and frankly just a total mess. People go to these places to become guinea pigs for recently graduated doctors, and often come in with 1 disease, and leave with something else. There are situations where there are nests of rats, cockroaches, pigs, dogs, stray cats and other animals running around in primary health care centers. The pigs are interesting - they\'re pets of the domas (a caste who gets rid of dead bodies). This is what most of the country\'s population gets in terms of healthcare.\n\nFor a tiny % of the urban middle class - they have the money to afford relatively decent private healthcare in nursing homes. Either they are insured, or they can afford to directly pay the bills. A lot of these private hospitals have medical malpractice issues, but still the overall costs are relatively low: because nobody can really pay more.\n\nNow when people from this "middle class" (affluent by Indian standards) go to America either to study, or to work - they are perennial cheapskates and will try to get the cheapest insurance possible, or somehow stay uninsured. Then when they fall ill, their shitty or non-existent insurance plan will become a disaster. So they come back to India for treatment. And brag about how great Indian healthcare is.\n\nTbh I\'m sick and tired of seeing the total ignorance about healthcare in India. Nobody actually gives a shit about understanding what are the real problems in Indian healthcare, how healthcare itself is not cheap (there are costs and not everything is going to be charity), and how pathetic government spending on healthcare is.'

The changes weren't necessary. Do you understand that? Everything was hunky dory and in a general check-up surgery was suggested. Now I might be lying but think this through. Do we really have a framework for Dr to review each other decisions?\n\nHell we don't even have a centralized patient database where Dr. can lookup anybodies medial history.\n\n> These decisions are taken after due consideration.\n\nNope.

Even in 2015, monthly average remained 6,179 as a total of 74,150 Pakistanis had been granted visas.\n\nA spokesperson of the state department told the The News International, “Visa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year and affected by various factors at the local and international level. Visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons, such as during the summer and the winter holidays, though there may be different trends at the country, nationality, or visa-category level”.\n\nThe data showed that Indian nationals received 87,049 visas in April and 97,925 visas in March this year. Last year, people from India received 72,082 non-immigrant visas each month on average with an annual total of 864,987 visas.\n\nPakistan is not the only Muslim-majority country experiencing decline in non-immigrant US visas. A similar analysis of 50 Muslim majority countries reveals that number of visas issued to their nationals has also declined by 20 per cent in April as compared to their monthly country average last year, the report said.\n\nThe six countries targeted by President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban - Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen - experienced a 55 per cent decline in non-immigrant visas compared with last year’s monthly average.\n\nExperts believe that drop in visas may indicate that more visa applicants are now subject to excessive scrutiny.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen.\n\nIn March, he signed the revised travel ban excluding Iraq from the list. The order was challenged in a court and a judge had halted the travel ban.\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

First off the regular voter in India has essentially zero understanding of climate change or how pollution needs to be stopped. It's not an electoral issue because people simply aren't at a state where they vote for anything outside of very core issues like getting a meal every day.\n\nPollution in India is some of the worst in the entire world, China is almost as bad and worse on some other metrics. Very little is done to combat this. There's filth everywhere and the sanitation situation is close to being a total disaster.

"The 1971 Act provides for prevention of disrespect and insult to national flag and Constitution of India and its punishment but makes no similar provision with respect to national anthem," argued Dwivedi.\n\n"Whoever in any public place or in any other place within public view burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words, either spoken or written, or by acts) the Indian National Flag or the Constitution of India or any part thereof, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both," says the Act.\n\nNot getting up when the anthem is being played, derogatory or improper use of anthem through any means of mass media and any kind of mutilation, distortion, displacement or alteration of the contents of the national anthem are among the the acts listed in Chouskey\'s petition. Responding to the view, Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who represented the Centre said the "respect of national anthem is non-negotiable and every citizen is bound to show due respect to national flag and anthem".\n\n"It is unfortunate that court has to intervene to ensure that people respect their national anthem which is their duty. It is a sad state of affairs that the petitioner had to come to a constitutional court for it when it is the duty of one and all," he said. Meanwhile, the court extended the exemption granted to certain categories of disabled persons from standing while national anthem is played in theatres to those affected with autism, cerebral palsy, multiple disabilities, Parkinson disease, stenosis, etc .\n\nAlso read: Disabled people need not stand for national anthem, says Supreme Court\n\nAlso read: Kashmiri cricketers seen singing Pakistan national anthem detained\n\n ______ \n ^I ^am ^just ^a ^bot, ^I ^cannot ^reply ^to ^your ^queries. ^Send ^a ^[*modmail*](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Findia&subject=Anti+Anti+Ad+Block+Bot) ^if ^you ^have ^any ^queries. ^Please ^provide ^a ^link ^to ^your ^submission. ^We ^would ^not ^be ^able ^to ^help ^you ^without ^a ^link.'

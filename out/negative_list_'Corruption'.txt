Shocking! BSF jawan Tei Bahadur who posted video alleging corruption, was asked to retire, now kept under arrest
‘We often sleep empty stomach’: BSF jawan’s video exposes the mess caused by corruption
"If they wanted to kill him they'd have posted him to a frontier post that gets lobbed with mortar regularly. In the military they don't need to do encounter killings, the enemy does it for them.\n\nThe dishonorable discharge is simply a way to steal his pension and social standing. Now, neither he or his family can avail medical or other benefits.\n\nedit: Our armed forces are riddled with nepotism and corruption. A cousin and his wife, both doctors in the IAF decided to retire a decade plus ago. They were under severe pressure to give into corruption - one of them had a mental breakdown from the stress, and so they left after nearly 20 years of service."
"He broke the rules. That doesn't mean he deserved this. He did the right thing. Problems of any whistleblower. Look at Snowden."
"Its scary how something this public didn't stop BSF from exerting their power ."
"To be honest, this is exactly how most militaries in the world work. They may be a subject of pride or debate for a layman, but inner working in any military has been shitty.\n\nThat said, this is still pathetic behaviour from officers, and should be changed. He didn't follow the rules, but that doesn't excuse how they are treating him."
'Ache din /s'
"Shocking is why it took so many days to make him retire and arrest for speaking the truth.I guess it's been the longest that no action has been taken against an Honest.India is progressing perhaps."
'Very sad. Modiji should intervene. '
"A message was very necessary, if he doesn't get punishment ,discipline in army would have been fucked beyond  repair.\nJust imagine if every day a Jawan is shouting on social media that he is not getting food,clothes etc\nWhat will the world think of us. Any developing country will have this problem"
'This is the pathetic states of our Heroes...'

"This is NOT shocking. And what he did could be right for us but it's against the ethics. Freedom of speech doesn't mean I go against the ethics of an organization I'm working for. Whistleblowing is a very controversial subject at this point and misuse should not be supported. \n\nHis grievances should be tackled within the regiment or within a specific wing within the BSF itself. You are in the BSF and you should resolve it within the BSF. \n\nIf acts like these are supported, several other acts whether right or wrong would have to be supported in the future too. Results in a lot of loopholes. And it could adversely affect the BSF and the security of the reason in some form or the other. For example, this could have given rise to a revolution which would have been pathetic. \n\nDo not show your country in a wrong light. But definitely show it within itself.

Without being specific, he told my father that he was under a lot of pressure to indulge in corruption (my father also worked for the government). \n\nThat's when we realised why he had started looking so haggard for a several of months before he quit. He used to be so cheerful and friendly. Then he stopped coming over to our place with his family (others members would still come). Would not smile as much, generally avoided me when I would go to his place...his hair greyed and he started looking older. Quite sad. "

'You are a fucking coward for saying that behind a throwaway account! '
"Well I don't agree with your thinking but consider this scenario.\n\nYou are working in a govt based organisation, a small factory where you are a labourer. Your superiors were harassed and now you are being harassed due to corruption/nepotism or based on some old shitty rules and regulations thats coming from centuries. You are expected to complain to the same superiors in case you face problems. What will you do?\n\nNow lets assume you knowing the consequences that if you complaint or share your problems, you will be harassed more and lose everything. Would you do that? Wont you keep taking the shit, hoping one day you will be senior and do the same? or be different and face shit from your new seniors and subordinates?\n\nNow lets assume, you have little more common sense than 99% of the labourers working alongside you. You make sure your complaint reaches the highest authority and the same authority asks the same seniors who were harassing you, to investigate on the issue. You still feel that ethics matter in such a organisation?"
'I actually agree with you that he did wrong. \n\nBut it is because the system is also not working. I believe that yes, he should be punished and this sort of behaviour should not be encouraged but he and other should be let off with a warning rather than doing something like this. \n\nThis is a new world and rules and regulations need to be made in that context. I guess there are no rules regarding these things in army and people are not prepared for these things. That should be the focus. \n\nThey did a bad job of handling this IMO.'
'Fuck the country. Only cowards and jigonistic morons would support this bullshit, the problems he highlighted were barely looked into but the man himself is under arrest and possibly will be killed by seniors. \n\n'
"The armed forces (of which the BSF is not a part, FWIW) do have such guidelines. That's why whistleblowers who go public with evidence of abuse are considered brave."
"Am I understanding you correctly that you believe he should have been discharged for posting the corruption on social media?\nI.e., you're blaming the soldier for going public?\n\n(If you do, keep in mind that internal review tends to be staffed by the buddies of the superiors.

"**‘We often sleep empty stomach’: BSF jawan’s video exposes the mess caused by corruption**\n\n___\n\n[IMAGE](http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/01/army-thumb.jpg?w=480)\n\n___\n\nArmy jawan alleges corruption by officers. Army jawan alleges corruption by officers.\n\nAt a time when those complaining about standing in bank queues due to demonetisation are being asked by the ‘so called nationalists’ to compare their pain to that of the soldiers standing at border, a BSF jawan has shared three videos which describe how our national heroes are badly treated, while doing their duty, by none other than the administration. The videos expose the dismal state of affairs in the Armed forces and the hardships our soldiers face everyday due to the “corrupt practices” of their own officers. And there is nothing nationalist about it. In fact, the videos, that have gone viral, may deter young aspirants from joining the armed force.\n\nThe video suggests that our jawans are not just exposed to the security threat from across the border and the elements, but are also subjected to humiliation and insult when it comes to their daily meals which are both substandard and insufficient. In fact, they even sleep empty stomach at times, the video reveals.\n\nArmy or paramilitary jawans usually don’t speak against seniors fearing strict punishment. However, Jawan Tej Bahadur of 29 battalion showed courage, may be because of his desperation, to talk about that humiliation without caring about the consequences. While we are told that Army provides best of food items to its jawans, the video of Bahadur presents a different picture. Half-baked chapatis and inedible daal are what the jawans get in their lunch, as shown in the video.\n\n“It must be looking very beautiful in the picture. But I want to tell you that our condition here is very pathetic. In these difficult conditions, we are honestly doing our duty. But what we are not getting sufficient food to eat. How can we do our duty then?” Bahadur questions in the video. One can imagine what must be going through the minds of jawans while being served such a distasteful meal.\n\nRead Also: BSF jawan in LoC alleges bad quality food; inquiry ordered\n\nInterestingly, Bahadur says that he doesn’t blame the government for all this. “Mai sarkar ko dosh nahi deta. Sarkar humey sab kuch deti hai. Ye adhikari hain jo sab kuch bahar bech detey hain. Iski jaanch honi chahiye,” says the jawan, blaming the officers and not the government, adding that his voice be heard by the media. Well, thanks to the power of the internet, his appeal has been widely circulated wihtin a few hours.\n\nFrom Bofors to Tatra truck, the list of corruption in the Army is not short. And if what Tej Bahadur is alleging is true, then it seems even the basic necessities are subject to graft in the forces. It is sad to note that while we have money to spend on new arms and equipment, there is no mechanism to ensure that our men on the border, our first line of defence, at least get a good meal at the end of the day for their efforts. Those in charge have some serious answering to do\n\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd\n\n___\n\n^Version ^: ^0.6a ^| [^Changelog](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4ssi0u/change_log/)\n\n^Function ^: ^I ^post ^the ^article's ^text ^as ^a ^comment ^if ^the ^website ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly.\n\n[^I ^accept ^commands!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anti_anti_adblock/comments/4u2iwn/commands_accepted_by_the_bot/)\n\n\n\n___\n\n^Powered ^by [^newspaper3k](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)"

The dal in the video was all watery which is okay once a week but if you have to eat that everyday I can imagine someone going mad over it. Plus I'm no cook so I really don't know what kind of spices you can add to it. He mentions cumin seeds which I think are standard ingredient."
'You dont get the point. There is no or very little Dal in the dal. Most of it just water haldi and salt.'
"The Dal has no 'dal' in it."
"A) Adani and Tata's power plants are one of the cheapest capital cost in India for that capacity. I am not aware of Reliance (Anil Ambani) case. Mukesh doesn't do thermal power\n\nB) All power purchase agreements (PPA) have a change in law clause and Force Majeure clause. PPAs are done on bidding basis with the lowest tariff winning in the bidding. Companies had asked for higher tariff under change in law but afaik, that was rejected. The force majeure allowed compensatory tariff as per APTEL\n\nC) Tata's have reduced their stake in coal mines\n\nD) The EPW article claims\n\n> The energy charges are recovered by power generating units from distribution companies based on the cost of fuel consumed. Thus, by artificially enhancing the price of imported coal, electricity generators are able to obtain a higher tariff fixation, to the detriment of consumers.\n\nThis is not true for Adani and Tata. The tariff for these imported coal based plant depends on movement of coal indices (mix of Indonesian and Australian coal indices) not the actual import bills. In some of the revised PPAs introduced later (2013 or 2014), it is lower of actual bill and indices. Discoms/CERC do this if as power developer are inefficient and import at higher prices, the Discoms and customers shouldn't be punished for it. However, the older plants (mostly NTPC) run on cost plus basis and then can charge higher tariff\n\nE) The discoms are not stupid. They immediately went to solar power plants and told them from the time of bidding till you build your power plants, costs have reduced. We will pay you less tariff (Gujarat was the most notorious)\n\nF) EPW also claims\n\n> How does over-invoicing power plant equipment lead to higher electricity tariffs for consumers? Electricity tariffs are arrived at by evaluating two sets of costs—fixed and variable. Fixed cost involves operations and maintenance together with servicing of equity and debt. Variable cost includes the fuel price and costs of fuel transportation and handling. Both the costs have a direct impact on tariff fixation. The fixed cost has a direct impact on tariff fixation, irrespective of whether a particular plant is operational (generates electricity) or otherwise as in the merit order dispatch, the plant with the lowest variable cost is placed on the top of the stack. As far as fixed cost is concerned, a plant’s debt-equity ratio is a key determinant when the regulator fixes the tariff. The regulators normatively divide debt and equity in a ratio of 70:30 while calculating tariffs. The cost of land, which is the other component of the fixed cost, is a relatively smaller component of the fixed cost. The major item under this head is the cost of equipment. By artificially over-valuing power plant equipment, the producer obtains a higher tariff from the regulatory authorities.\n\nThis is again not true for Adani and Tata power plants. Adani and Tata (and reliance as well) bid for tariff. If their capital cost increases, they don't get compensation. Only cost plus tariff models works on what EPW is suggesting (mostly NTPC and state generating units) and Adani and Tata don't have a cost plus PPAs."
"This post is full of misinformation. \n\nYour basic premise is factually wrong. \n\nThe rise in Indonesian coal prices benefited the Indonesian government and not the miners. The incremental money, when benchmarked, was taken away as royalty.\n\nWhat it means is even if an Indian company had a mine owning subsidiary in Indonesia, the company did not benefit from higher coal prices.\n\nSecondly Tata (you somehow didn't mention them) and Adani have been trying hard to get compensated for higher coal prices citing force majeure. However, contrary to your assertion it has not been approved by the regulator, governmet or the courts. \n\nPremise and conclusion both flawed.\n\n[Read this](http://m.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/tatas-mundra-project-staring-at-a-loss-of-rs-47500-crore-due-to-sc-order/article9629944.ece)\n   "
"Just read this article to know how far down the rabbit hole Adani & Modi's relationship go: [**Modi and Adani: the old friends laying waste to India’s environment**](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/06/27/modi-adani-old-friends-laying-waste-indias-environment/)\n\nModi is a outright liar - Narendra Modi’s new incarnation as a climate warrior and defender of the Paris climate agreement rubs off quickly, especially when his old ally from home begins talking about his future plans. Modi tells the world what it wants to hear but his primary constituency is a group of industrial cronies – of whom Adani is first among equals – whose interests are unaligned with actions that address climate change, nor any of India’s plethora of environmental crises.\n\nModi takes Adani along to whichever country he visits and gets the deals sealed for Adani & other crony chums. In Nov 2016 at the height of DeMo, Modi accompanied Adani to Australia to get him the Coal Mine deal signed and SBI gave $1 billion line of credit to the Adani Group.\n\nThis is a rather terrific achievement by someone who was arrested once in December 2002 by the Delhi Police in a Rs 5-crore cheating case; and was kidnapped for 18 hours by suspected underworld in 1997 in Ahmedabad (His family had filed no FIR then and the police said that Adani had to be “gently persuaded” to file a complaint)\n\n[The Incredible Rise and Rise of Gautam Adani:](http://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/NewsDetail/index/1/3375/The-Incredible-Rise-and-Rise-of-Gautam-Adani-Part-One)"

The company said it is "an absolute and religiously law-abiding organisation and respects the law of the land".'
"But the price of Indonesian cola rose because Indonesian go to wanted to tax on that price,  not because the stakeholders wanted to increase the profits.  \nWith the increased price,  sure their margins also rose,  but not keeping that extra money would now be technically a loss since they were paying tax on it.  So ultimately the poor can't afford electricity because Indonesian got wants a cut of the profits. "
'ribiy\'s post below has a article on how ADANI and TATA power plants were denied their comp tariff by the SC after CERC granted them a formula for higher coal pricing, SC set aside that pricing formula precisely because "Foce majeure event" (price rise in international Indonesian coal) cannot be claimed under PPA\'s unless it happens in india.

One argument is that it prevents a scope for application being rejected due to data mismatch).\n\n2: The second fingerprint is to electronically sign the document (and declare that I have read the terms and conditions, and it's really me who wants this connection etc. etc.)\n\nThe way Aadhaar is currently designed, there are entirely legitimate reasons to require biometrics to be presented multiple times. \n\n- Is this a security concern? **Absolutely.**\n\n- Does the fact that you presented it twice at the Jio booth mean you just got hacked? **No**.\n\n- Is there a way to get a Jio SIM without having to present it twice? **No, AFAIK.**\n\n(Jio SIM used here purely as an indicative example. Writer has no relation/commercial arrangement whatsoever ~~to~~ with Modi, Ambani, Gujarat or cows)."
'OutOfTheLoop question: To what extent can the Aadhaar be misused for? Even if some of our personal details are stolen through Aadhaar, what will they get out of it?'
"It must be said, I still don't have an Aadhar card and I don't intend on getting one anytime soon. I think it has its flaws and the bullish enforcement is suffocating.\n\nI'm trying to be neutral here even though there might not be a good enough reason to. \n\nAt its worst, this data will get leaked and people are *hopefully* going to get why there was some reluctance. It's only a matter of time if our fears are true.\n\nThe other point is we really do not know ever how much of our money has gone into what. Now or in the past.\n\nDoesn't mean you have to downvote my comment."
'Not a fan of Jio.\n\nBut I know people who got Jio Sim without aadhaar card. Activation took longer.'
'LOL, Don\'t we also have that scam where we hire uneducated women in villages and teach them to go spread gossip of sanitary napkins. I heard one of them was taught  how condom works by putting it on the stick . Few months later a doctor came to the village and observed one rural relative putting a condom on a stick. Apparently the village "health education teacher" had taught his wife how to stop having kids. This was created by Cangress , a nice job scheme though. '
'The worst thing that can happen is your Aadhar gets blocked for some reason and then you cannot get a new one as they check your biometrics. Apart from that, it is fearmongering at its best. '
"> At its worst, this data will get leaked and people are *hopefully* going to get why there was some reluctance.\n\nNot necessarily. The worst case scenario is that the data gets leaked to private parties who don't reveal that the leak has happened, but instead use the information obtained for nefarious purposes."
"Government sites have already apparently accidentally been leaking aadhar info. I think Dhoni's info was compromised on one of those."
"AFAIK that is no longer an option.\n\nAadhaar is now mandatory for all new mobile connections. Is there a way to do it manually and skip eKYC though? I don't know."
'Sshhh, you can make these gullible randians believe anything if you bash cow. JSR!'
'This is the first i\'m hearing of this "scam" or whatever it is you\'re trying to convey. Source please?\n\nAlso, how is this weird anecdote relevant here?\n'
"There is no list. Virtually all Ministers' offsprings study abroad."
'Two things:\n\nFirst, that is a legitimate fear to never want it. A malicious government could ruin your life through just one move. People are uncomfortable with handing the government so much power.\n\nSecond, to say that concern about issues of identity theft and data leaks are "fear mongering" means you\'re either being naive or you have a vested interest in this issue.'
"The Policy flair is more apt here. If you're in doubt, always go with a formal flair."
'If you are worried about this, let me tell you: it will only get worse from here.\n\nThe reason for corruption is neither Modi nor Manmohan. The reason is there is no timely punishment (deterrent) for being corrupt.'
"It's only going to get worse. We were on the right track. UPA corruption was getting highlighted, people were asking questions, demanding answers, there was a working RTI system, CAG reports were getting media coverage and finally they were punished in the 2014 elections. Now we have gone completely backwards. Apparently Modi is incorruptible so he can do anything and get away with it. "
"BJP and corruption... No no it's fake news, must be spread by congress.\n\nMitron 2022 ke naam pe vote de dena 2019 Mein "

'Life is hell in India if you are not among the top 1% of the population. You have zero chance to get their honestly if you are not from right background. So, people wants to make money by hook or crook. This is the root of all the corruption.'
'A survey (with a small sample size) about what people "THINK" is meaningless. What people think doesn\'t matter as much as what people "DO". And the sad reality is that we are still a Nation of corrupt bureaucracies and will likely remain so for a long time. And as far as what people think is concerned, a lot of Indian people "think" drinking cow urine is a cure all, that eating food during an eclipse will kill you, and numerous other bullshit, can\'t take the word of such people seriously.'
'No sane person who is not fooled by the propaganda of the Govt thinks they are fighting corruption. '
"And 69% had to pay a bribe of some sort. That's the highest in the region."
'I agree with you, the lower echelons of the government is where most of the corruption occurs. However, it was this government that promised that all this would cease because they were not like their predecessors. \nCorruption is far to systemic a problem to be done away with by one government or their policies, it requires the common man to cooperate as well.'
'wrong math. calculate the 50% of 70% - around 450 million bigots. sounds about right based on the number of people i have met in my life. '
"Sorry, both periods were so crap, couldn't tell which one was the promised period."

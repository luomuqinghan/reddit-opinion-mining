Tamil Nadu youth killed for being an atheist, father says he too will become one
No patience for violent 'gau rakshaks', cops thrash vigilantes in Tamil Nadu
This Journalist Is Going Through Hell For Exposing Illegal Beach Sand Mining In Tamil Nadu
'man the sadness in his eyes is just painful, just thinking of how hard his life must have been and how hard he worked for his family just makes me so mad! '
"Great stuff, isn't it? There is a real problem with the way atheists are treated in India across religions. Needless to say that in some Muslim communities, this problem is even more exaggerated due to the spread of Salafi teaching on apostasy. It's just a real shame to see the death to the apostate attitude spreading to TN as well, which as a society is relatively accepting of atheists compared to other Indian states. "
'>the main accused are Saddam Hussein...\n\nAlive and kicking I see. I wonder if Hitler is hiding away in the backwoods of Tamil Nadu posing as a day laborer just biding his time until he is outraged by a Jewish post on Whatsapp.\n\nSo are these guys facing the death penalty? Seems like quite a sophisticated murder conspiracy.'
'Reminds me of what Bill Maher said, "Islam is the only religion that acts like its the fucking mafia, if you say the wrong word, or do the wrong thing".'
'The taboos of atheism and inter-caste marriage in India must be broken down to avoid these murders, and the culprits of these crimes harshly punished.'
'While dabholkar and pansare get country wide attention this poor kid will get none. '
'>then they killed my son using ~~wrong~~ interpretations of the Quran. \n\nFTFY.\n\nOn a serious note, why the hell were you juggling chainsaws? You gave a permanent statement that you were an apostate when you are physically surrounded by muslims.\n\nAll religions are not equally dangerous.'
'There needs to be reckoning for this. No Muslim body will condemn this and some might even support killing because of the blasphemy laws in islam.   \nReligion of peace strikes again'
'Now everyone will say "India is Intolerant".Oh wait it wasn\'t a Hindu on Muslim crime so i guess we should be fine.Had it been a Hindu on Hindu homicide for the exact same reasons Bollywood,Digvijay Singh,Shobha De and the other usual social commentators with Underdeveloped Brains and Overdeveloped Fingers would have not wasted a single second to tweet something about Hindu Extermism and comparing it with ISIS.'
'Not surprised. Muslims work as a gang. If something happen against them they act together. and their religion also says to kill if someone leave the religion.And there is also other things like: Muslim women cant marry from other religion but a muslim guy can marry from other religion and must have to convert her to marry!! Sorry if i Hurt someone but thats the truth.'
'>According to Coimbatore police, six people have been arrested in the case, all daily-wage labourers, including the main accused Saddam Hussein, Abdul Munaf and Jaffer Ali, who were known to Farook. Police said all of them have confessed to their role in the murder.\n\nWas hoping this would bring some consolation. I was wrong.'
'"We\'ve always been at war with Eastasia"\n\n-- this thread, basically. '
"I'm fairly religious but everyone deserves the right to have or not have a faith. What the fuck do these morons hope to achieve by killing someone who don't share their beliefs? If these morons actually practised the religion they preached, then they'd know that killing is the ultimate sin in the eyes of God. These fuckers aren't religious, they're murderers who kill with religion as their alibi."
'Isnt there anybody in this whole sub, who has anything else to say other than shitting on India? Whats wrong with you people? cheer up! Life is not that bad and stop crying!'
'>“I do not wish to see this as a black-and-white case. Either they acted as hired killers for some other group or were absorbed by radical Islam groups for this crime. The idea of them being radicals does not match their lifestyle. Munaf was not attending prayers at the mosque for almost three months,” said a relative of Farook, who requested anonymity.'
"Why do headlines say random shit without the word 'allegedly' when the content of the article makes it clear that it's all just conjecture?"
'According to police, clues from Farook’s mobile phone, which was found at the murder spot, led to the arrests.\n\n---\n\n> * THE FATHER of H Farook, the atheist who was murdered in Coimbatore 10 days ago, allegedly by members of a Muslim radical group, has said that if his son was killed for his views, he too would become an atheist.\n\n> * Speaking to The Indian Express, 54-year-old R Hameed said, If the police version is true, that he was murdered by a radical Muslim group, then they killed my son using wrong interpretations of the Quran.\n\n> * According to police, clues from Farooks mobile phone, which was found at the murder spot, led to the arrests.\n\n> * Munaf called Farook out from home, at around 11.20 pm, on the night of the murder, they said.\n\n---\n\n\n\nHere are some other news items:^credits ^to ^u-sr33\n\n> * [PHOTOS: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s perfect birthday party for Aaradhya, Aamir Khan’s son and Akshay Kumar’s daughter attend](http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/aishwarya-rai-bachchan-aaradhya-birthday-party-aamir-khan-son-akshay-kumar-daughter-see-pics-4386997/)\n\n---\n\n^I\'m ^a ^bot ^| ^OP ^can ^reply ^with ^"delete" ^to ^remove ^| [^Message ^Creator](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sallurocks) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/hunkdivine/samacharbot2) ^| ^Did ^I ^just ^break? ^See ^how ^you ^can ^help! ^Visit ^the ^source ^and ^check ^out ^the ^Readme'

'Ahh feudal religious fanatic India going the way of the Taliban day by day. The upcoming middle class has the same mentality as the Taliban whether we want to admit it or not. While this guy was a Muslim, last week we saw the a rationalist killed by Hindus. Day by day the hidden gems of feudal India come to fore. '
'The guy seemed to be more of an anti-theist than an atheist. But what happened to him is really sad and condemnable.'

"I'm increasingly getting convinced tat Hitler's idea that Jews were bad people.. Or rather bad for Germany wasn't wrong. He just went crazy and killed so many that he turned out to be the bad guy. \n\nOh also many scientists.. Even Jewish ones believe (with researched evidence) that the holocaust didn't happen the way it is said to have happened.. That there might have not been gas chambers and that the number of Jews that died was more like 1,1.5 million and not 6. Perhaps the Jews exaggerated everything for sympathy?! "
"RSS is also not less in India.\nChristian missionaries conspires to violence in Europe, which I have read.\nIt's just that they are well covered."
'Probably because this kid was killed by the wrong kind of fundamentalists.'
'This is a global muslim problem, not just a TN problem.'
'>If god is testing us, he is failing miserably.\n\nFTFY'
'6 millions Jews were killed by Hitler alone. Your God was "testing" them? If yes, what was the verdict of Holocaust? '
'FYI,If we were living in Germany, you would be prosecuted for Holocaust denial.'
"Yep. Hitler was actually a saint who went out of his way and set up camps to help the jews who were the poorest people in Europe at the time and just look at how they malign him now. The bastards! Also dude, whatever you're on, score me some."
'Wow! A Holocaust denier among our midst? I never thought i would see this!'

"Bill Maher's quote has been taken completely out of context. He said what he did in the immediate aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks and criticised the view of blasphemy in Islam or at least certain strands of it. It is irrelevant which one of the two that is since the ones that believe blasphemy ought to be punished with death are strong enough in number and resources to cause enough damage. "
'Bullshit. \n\nThis story has been reported by all major newspapers. How is it not country-wide attention? \n\nComparison to an earlier story who was killed by the "right kind of fundamentalists"\n\nhttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2016/nov/19/32-year-old-islam-convert-hacked-to-death-in-malappuram-1540384.html\n\nPeople even downvoted the story here. \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5g9yyg/hindu_mother_of_man_who_was_killed_over_religious/\n\nI don\'t see any difference between the coverage and outrage over that incident and this. \n'
'You are upset and your beliefs are very religious/dogmatic in nature and expression. Maybe take a step back and analyze them rationally so you can discard them and be reasonable.'
"Thousands of Hindus who are now atheists in TN. No, they aren't. "
'RSS and other Right wing Hindu organizations try to revert Converted Muslims back to Hinduism.Their methods(Deplorable nonetheless) include Bribery,eviction threats and many boycotts in the same vein.Politicians,celebrities and News media cover such attempts extensively and "Secular" parties bitch about intolerance and Secularism.Sure Hindus have killed Converts before but it was national news and part of a political debate every single time.\nIn this case an atheist Convert Muslim was killed because his religious views didn\'t conform with the views of some illiterate assholes.I don\'t see Azam khan,Lalu prasad Yadav,Kejriwal or Amir Khan even commenting about this incident.Your logic is part of a larger ludicrous narrative which mistakes secularism for the ignorance of the crimes committed by the Minority of a country and Hyper-ventilates the  Majority population\'s shortcomings.The fact that you tell me to shut up without a shred of understanding of any of the themes in play just proves who needs to stay away from a keyboard and voicing their opinions on a public forum.'

"I still don't understand why people would riot?  \nI mean, what would they achieve by rioting(if she dies of natural causes)"
'Hey Guys, non Indian here, is there some kind of national mourning? going on? We just got call in on BCP (I work on IT) and they say Chenai is not working today.'
"* So how are the chances of someone recovering after being on life support, asking coz at times it's better to let someone pass than be in pain like that\n* Why is there mass hysteria about riots? burning buses etc? even US Consulate said no business - is there someone to blame\n* If she was so respected, the mourning should be quiet without fights\n* I thought when Bal Thackeray would die, it would create chaos but nothing happened"
'I think I get what\'s going on here. I have some experience with this. My grandaunt, suffered catastrophic organ failures. But with the help of machines she stayed "alive" for a month. Since she was in a Catholic Hospital they refused to let her die. She was in a coma for two weeks during which we had an argument with the hospital to let her die which we finally forced it to do after we threatened a court case. \n\n\nAmma is probably dead just being kept alive with the machines. I think the people who have responsibility with her are refusing to pull the plug. I can\'t tell you why though. Apollo is a non religious hospital so it isn\'t them. Its her family or colleagues who are refusing to let her die. Man, the agony she is probably going through right now....I wouldn\'t wish that fate on anyone....'
'wait till past midnight they will declare she is dead'
"Bhai I don't understand why people will do riots for her death. She was a human after all. This reeks of cult-like behaviour. As if god has died or there has been a war or something. Ridiculous."
'People, try to understand what death is...legally now.\n\nShe will be alive and vegetative till the doctors want.. Just matter of when to pull the plug now. There is no comming back now.'
'I mean we got to respect the deceased and remember them. But why do we Indians always go over the top like fanatics? The whole nation will mourn but this shutting down whole cities and public services and advice to stay put behind doors are so fucked up. Why, I mean why? Everyone is so drowned in emotion that they want to commit suicide and damage things and hurt people who are not mourning like them? As long as we are like this, politicians will continue to screw us. '
"Yup. She's dead now. It's confirmed"
'My parents told me when M.G.R died, lot of people committed suicide.\n\nGod know what kind of chaos will happen now.'
"News18 and NDTV says it's fake. AIADMK supporters attempt to break police barricade and pelt stones but Police respond by lathi-charging.\n\nEdit: JayaTV first said that Amma is no more but after riots almost started at Apollo Hospital, they changed their story and said she is still being treated. The police was able to disperse the crowd without much effort."
'Imagine if she comes out of the hospital with a "bitch im back" smirk...lol lol \n\nKarunanidhi would have a heart attack'
"I am still trying to digest the fact that people can get all violent once their beloved leader passes away. I say that because even I revere some leader or the other. Just that in my case, I revere Shivaji Maharaj, if I had been alive in the early 1700s when he died, I'd have been dumbstruck that I wouldn't leave my home, let alone riot on the streets. I mean no disrespect, they are great leaders, yes, but they are humans first. They have to be given the dignity of death. We have witnessed so many leader's deaths postponed so that it doesn't affect public life, come on, they are people, they have their families and they deserve to die a peaceful death _with_ their loved ones.\n\nWould Amma have liked that her followers who follow her like people who follow a religion, shut the state down after her death? nope, she'd want everyone to mourn, yes, but NOT disrupt life."
'Holy shit. Look at this thread!!'
"When big peepal die, their death isn't announced very soon. There is also a reason for the delayed announcement. They have to take iris scans, fingerprints and what-not to open the swiss-lockers and shit. Same happened with Balasaheb Thackery and Dhirubhai Ambani. "
'Rip.\n\nI know she had her critics, but she undoubtedly did a whole lot of good for the state as well, and many of her schemes were undoubtedly pro public and pro poor. Sad sad moment to see her go. '

"Don't they always say not to take food from others while traveling?\n\nOn one occasion, I had a side lower seat and there was this middle aged guy sitting in front of me. He offered me an apple immediately as the train started. My detective senses got active and I refused while trying to keep my face cheerful. He kept insisting for about 5 minutes that I have the apple and I kept refusing, my refusal getting more vehement as time passed. \n\nFinally, he realized that I did not take the apple because I was skeptical of taking food from strangers. He made a face and started eating that apple in front of me in an exaggerated manner just to show that the apple was fine. \n\nAs for the groping bit, a female friend of mine faced harassment when she was sleeping on the upper berth.

'WTF? This is such a retarded sensationalist article.\n\n\nSince when did vigilantes start going to the police? \n\n\n[Here\'s a source for those who don\'t want any of the "left wing vs right wing" and  "cow vigilantes" *bull*shit.](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tension-in-palani-over-transporting-cattle/article19166505.ece)\n\n\n\n>Tension gripped the temple town of Palani as an unruly mob threw stones on a section of people in front of the taluk police station near here on Wednesday in a dispute over transportation of cattle.\n\n>Ten persons were injured and the front windscreen of a corporation bus was damaged in the attack.\n\n>Sendalankara Sampathkumara Ramanuja Jeeyar of Shenbaganalllur, who was going to Pollachi from Mannargudi to take part in a kumbhabhishekam, intercepted a mini van transporting five calves and two bulls on Pudhu Dharapuram Road in the temple town. The Jeeyar brought the van to the Palani taluk police station and lodged a complaint stating that the cattle was transported in a van without following guidelines and that they were dumped in the van without any feed and water. Preliminary inquiries suggested that Udayakumar of Thevanur Pudhur near Pollachi was transporting the cattle.\n\n>As the police took a long time to decide on filing a case against the cattle owner, the information about seizure of cattle spread in the town.\n\n>Members of various Muslim organisations assembled before the police station condemning the seizure of cattle.\n\n>At the same time, members of a few Hindu outfits too came to the taluk police station. When the Jeeyar came out of the police station, an unruly mob threw stones on his vehicle and people waiting outside the station. The police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob. Later, members of Hindu outfit picketed the road. Four injured persons were admitted to Palani Government Hospital for treatment.\n'
"In regional news channels they said, \n\n\nYoung calf was taken in a truck, Suspicious Hindu activists lodged a police complaint and Beef supporters ganged up near the spot as both groups started attacking in public. police involved and trashed them all later. \n\n\nFYI, Cow slaughter is already banned in TN but consuming beef isn't."
"> It's not as if the police resorted to force willy nilly.\n\nNo, but watching the segment in the video it is clear that the police violence lasted longer than it needed to, and in their zeal for beating up a few, they allowed a much larger number to flee. The police do need better training, and the violent mobs deserve to tot in jail after conviction, not an eye for an eye treatment from cops."
'BJP was never really popular there though. Most of the communal tensions and riled up in areas with large Muslim populations like UP or WB. '
'Caste violence is still quite high in TN though and caste based politics is also quite popular'
'Why? They are no different than the \'gau rakshaks\', beating up people who they think should be beaten. They should have arrested them and pressed charges instead. Next time they\'ll beat you up because they have "no patience" for you. Then what? '
'Apparently police assaulting common people is sanity now.'
'Yes. They should have tied these Hindu Terrorists to the front of a truck and paraded them throughout the city.'
'Police action le toh dikat na le toh dikat.\n\nSometimes people hate just for sake of hating.'
'read the article moron, they started beating them up after stones were thrown at the police and the "rakshaks" started vandalising public property.'

I think it\'s alrighty to use lathi to put some sense into this, or "Hindu munnani" will soon be Tamil Nadus Hindu mahasabha or vhp or Sri Ram sene. Tamils must not forget that only ideologies can defeat ideologies.  Tamil culture withstanding thousands of years or gau terrorism as new culture? Your choice.'

Tamil channels reported that the public bus was vandalized during the protest.\n\n> Following this, police lathi charged members of the Hindu Munnani.\n\nI see no unlawful approach by the cops here."
'They were allegedly pelting stones. So by the standards of the right wing in India, a lathi charge is too soft a punishment. We must condemn the police for not tying these men to the front of vans and busses.'
'They were controlling a rioting mob which was attacking them.'

'No point arguing with Bhakths. They will go to any extent to defend their retarded ideology.'
'>  the cops were on their side. \n\nExactly. Polimer news was the first channel to report the story, and according to them, the VCK got mad that the police took Jeeyar\'s side, so they waited outside for him to come out and when he came out, they started throwing stones.\n\nHow come ""cow vigilantes"" are responsible for this violence?\n\n\nThere\'s absolutely no need to use  words like "left wing", "right wing", and "gau rakshaks" in that article.'

"> culture of the state.\n\nTrue. Both Kerala and Tamil Nadu rejected conservative hindu movements since the late 19th century because of the **severity of the caste system** in both the states. The very low percentage of UC hindus in the states (*Kerala hinduism is 70% OBC+Dalit while in TN its almost 85-90%*) also contributed to the lack of support for Hindu revivalist movements which were after all pioneered by Brahmin thinkers. \n\nWhile in TN, the movement took the form of Dravidanism under periyar which rejected Brahmin power and put Tamil-dravidian identity at the forefront, Kerala's social awakening was divided into reformist hindu movements under OBC/Dalit leaders like Narayana guru and Ayyankali and the communist movement . The BJP is enjoying a revival in Kerala since late 2000's due to the neglect of Hindu interests for minority votebank politics.  "

'Irrespective of the nature of the mob, the crowd control strategy of our police needs a major overhaul. They start beating people left and right even when the protest is peaceful.'
'Arrest them then.'
'How do you arrest a mob without quelling it with some sort of a charge first?'
'Police brutality is equally condemnable in each Indian state. I am not justifying what the police did, I am merely explaining why they did it. Unfortunately, a lathi charge is SOP for mob-control in India. \n\nAs for the difference with Kashmir, police brutality is not protected by draconian laws. '
'So you mean police should have waited till 4 police men had gotten injured from the stone pelting by the mob?'
'They did a lathi charge to disperse both sides, with no discrimination in their attack. Both sides had indulged in vandalism in a public area. This response was warranted.\n\nMaybe read the article before pushing your agenda.'
'Dude it was a lathi charge. It is like a standard operating procedure for mob control in India. \n\nIn Kashmir stone pelters are fired upon with pellet guns or even real guns.'
'I think the main reason Bullshit like this spreads is because Indians think scientifically researched medicine is "western" medicine. That right there is a huge problem.

"burn it like fire, the mistake which was made with these things earlier is to treat it as if they were stupid idiots who would inevitably get pushed away by reality.\n\nThe fact is that in the internet era, this shit spreads like wildfire.\n\ntheres been a recent paper on how messages travel between scientific groups and conspiracy groups (essentially a study on how fake news could propogate).\n\nIt shows that these two groups tend not to share the informaiton between each other. I'm assuming this is american data, so their polarization may be an issue, which we dont face yet.\n\nAny and all doctors need to burn this shit with fire. The person responsible needs to get sued, and recant. Hell if Docs need to put posters up at their offices, it needs to be done.\n\nIn the end doctors, med students are held in high regard in our country. Link them up to these whatsapp and see if they can pen a response. \n\nMaybe even an unkill network forward targetting the vaccine conspiracists, making them out (not incorrectly) as part of a western conpsiracy would work.\n\nConspiracy messages get stronger over time, and get forwarded more as the diversity of forwarders increases.\n(science oriented messages have no such effect).\n\nget a counter message and get it forwarded. eventually some medical group in India will pen a document on whatsapp forwards."

"It seems half of the comments here haven't read the article and are basing their opinion on the picture in the thumbnail. It isn't about mid day meals or meat eating.The article in question is exclusively talking about children under 23 months of age. How much of their health is informed by their mothers health? I suppose a lot. Even then I think little children do not get fed a lot of meat during the first few years of their life, their diet usually includes cerelac and other easily digestible food in the first 23 months. So I don't think we can pin this on lesser one sole factor alone.\n\nI think the issue here is poverty and a severe lack of nutritional needs. Many people who are vegetarians do not take good care of their protein needs and other vital vitamins that may be deficient due to the form of diet. Naturally if the mother is deficient the child would be too. So the solution is to have a good diet, but a good diet costs money, and I am not even talking about meats or dry fruits. Your average daal, and other beans like chana and rajma are expensive as hell. So how does your average middle class vegetarian family fulfill their nutritional needs? Being a vegetarian myself, I don't really think there exists a way to get proteins without spending money, more money if you are vegetarian, and you still lack some vitamins for which you can buy supplements. My friend in school was a jain, and he was an athlete. He consumed kilos upon kilos of cashews and was eating black chana and other beans like that. He drank gallons worth of milk and a weeks worth of veggies of a normal diet everyday, plus there were supplements. \n\nPeople are so unaware about nutrition that they take it for granted and I think a lot of the kids suffer because total lack of awareness. In Rajasthan you have only 3% of kids below the age of 2 are getting adequate nutrition. I think a lot of these kids are from well to do families who can afford to provide all the nutrition but are simply unaware. 3% is a shockingly low."
'Can you blame Tamils for not wanting to be forced to learn Hindi. The more Hindi you speak the less nutritious your meal becomes.'
'Meanwhile Arun Jaitley is desperate to cut the fiscal deficit. How can someone be a fiscal conservative on the behest of corporate interests when children are starving.'
"Hahaha. India wants to be a Super power with malnutritioned children, unskilled labour force, lack of spending on healthcare,education and other essential sectors,  No R& D in education despite having fourth highest number of PhD holders in the world, worshiping cow as mother, Caste system,  feudal mindset, oppressing women and minorities, Mob lynching of people, faulty justice system that takes years to deliver faulty verdicts, etc. The list goes on and on and on. Then Randians and Randia wonder why people from the developed countries laugh at us and ridicule us all the time. Along with having tiny penises statistically, we're literally full of Cow Shit and Gau Mutra. "
'People who would rather elect getting idiots of right religion/caste/family elected than qualified people, deserve this shit happening to their kids.'
'What is considered adequate nutrition ?\n\nBecause my suspicion is states like Gujarat, Rajasthan are overwhelmingly vegetarian and hence lack of specific amounts of protein might count as inadequate even though they might get carbs. Just a hypothesis'
"Majority Indians can't buy all these things. \n\nAnd curry is a complex process. Usually, no one will cook beans, fish, and vegetables. Fruits are usually expensive. Fish is not available in surplus in central India. Coastal cities have access to ample fish, but in Bangalore fish is missing.\n\nIn India, milk is actually expensive.  Because dairy productivity is low. Similarly, fish productive is one of the lowest in the entire world. \n\nOther than rice and seasonal vegetables, everything is damn expensive according to the average living standard. "
"> How can someone be a fiscal conservative on the behest of corporate interests when children are starving.\n\nIt's not very expensive to provide midday meals, subsidized food to pregnant women. It's lack of initiative at the state level and inefficient bureaucracy. If schools replace pulses and eggs with bad quality pulses and less number of eggs, you can't blame the government at New Delhi."

"I consider myself center in the whole left-right line because I believe both sides have valid *arguments* and offer *solutions* to certain problems and embracing both sides will help us grow both as individuals and countries. \n\nBut people like you on both sides of the aisle have a way of making me swing to the other side. This is NOT a defensive argument. This is me standing against an idiot who seem to only look at every problems in society (and thinking that they are only isolated to India) and just spew hate on the internet instead of even offering an iota of a solution. I hate your statement as much as an extreme right winger with their xenophobic and racist attitudes.

I don\'t know if people in rural India buy fruits or cereal. Some have access to milk and egg. \n\nIn Odisha, there was a tv program called "Kalyani", where they used to inform all the food necessity and kid raising habits. But, due to lack of education(not literacy), rural women could not solve the issue. Many men in villages will beat their wife black and blue if they suggest anything to buy.'
